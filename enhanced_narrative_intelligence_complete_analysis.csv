U.A.E. Shares Rally to 5-Year High on Earnings; Saudi Climbs,['Sherine El Madany'],2013-07-21 12:33:24,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-21/u-a-e-shares-rally-to-5-year-high-on-earnings-saudi-climbs.html,"United Arab Emirates stock indexes rallied to the highest levels in almost five years on bets the economic recovery will spur company earnings. Saudi Arabian shares rose after Saudi Basic Industries Corp. reported results. Dubai’s benchmark DFM General Index (DSM) gained 1.8 percent to 2,541.52, the strongest since November 2008, at the close in the emirate, as Dubai Investments PJSC (DIC) jumped 6.1 percent, taking its three-day advance to 16 percent. Abu Dhabi ’s ADX General Index (MSM30) increased for an 11th day, its longest stretch of gains in two months, climbing 0.9 percent to 3,857.52, the highest since September 2008. Dubai’s economy, which is recovering after a property market crash, is set to grow 4.6 percent, on average, between 2012 and 2015, more than twice as fast as in the prior four years, government forecasts show. Tamweel PJSC (TAMWEEL) , a mortgage provider based in the emirate, jumped 3.6 percent to 1.16 dirhams, the highest close in a month, after reporting a 40 percent increase in second-quarter profit. “The strength we’ve seen over the last three quarters clearly indicates strong expectations for earnings to improve, and growing bottom lines are a validation of market strength thus far,” said Amer Khan, a Dubai-based director at Shuaa Asset Management. The rally “points to how confident investors are in the prospects for the U.A.E. economy to continue recovering and growing,” he said. The DFM and ADX are among the world’s top-five best-performing indexes this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of Dubai Financial Market (DFM) , which have more than doubled this year, rallied 4.6 percent today before the company reported an almost seven-fold increase in quarterly profit after market hours. Sabic Results Saudi Arabia ’s Tadawul All Share Index advanced for the first time in three days, gaining 1 percent to 7,740.46 after Sabic, the world’s largest petrochemicals company by market value, said it was studying investment opportunities in the U.S. as the economic slowdown in Europe and China hurt its second-quarter sales. The stock advanced 1.4 percent, the most since May 21, to 93.50 riyals. “Numbers are weaker than estimates, though, given affiliates also failed to meet estimates, this miss is expected,” Sriharsha Pappu, a Dubai-based analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc, said by phone. Pappu, who has a buy rating on the shares, said analysts estimated Sabic (SABIC) ’s earnings before the company’s units reported results. “We’re looking for better third-quarter results. This quarter is mostly down to pricing.” Elsewhere in the Middle East , Egypt ’s benchmark EGX 30 Index rose 1.4 percent, the most since July 9, as the nation’s interim cabinet convenes for the first time today. Oman’s MSM30 Index increased 0.2 percent and Kuwait’s gauge climbed 0.6 percent. Qatar’s QE Index fell 0.1 percent and Bahrain’s measure lost 0.3 percent. In Israel , the benchmark TA-25 Index (TA-25) decreased 0.1 percent at 3:33 p.m. in Tel Aviv , while the yield on the benchmark 4.25 percent bonds due in March 2023 declined three basis points to 3.68 percent.

Bosh finished with 23 points last night in San Antonio, Texas, to lead the Heat, who were without James, Wade and Mario Chalmers because of injuries. “We are the defending champions no matter who we put out there,” Bosh told reporters after Miami won for the 29th time in its past 30 games. “We are still the Miami Heat.” The previous time Miami and San Antonio played in January, the Spurs were fined $250,000 by the NBA for holding Tim Duncan , Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker out of the game. The Spurs won that meeting 105-100. Duncan and Kawhi Leonard each scored 17 points last night for the Spurs (55-18). Miami is now an NBA-best 58-15.

The transportation proposals are expected to become legally binding by end of April, the U.K. oil and gas producer said. They include “substantial” information about the technical, regulatory, and financial aspects of the Nabucco West and TAP projects, according to the statement.

An average Atlantic season produces 11 storms, according to the center.

German Factory Orders Unexpectedly Fall,['Jeff Black'],2011-10-06 10:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/german-factory-orders-unexpectedly-fall.html,"German factory orders unexpectedly fell for a second month in August as domestic demand waned. Orders, adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation, declined 1.4 percent from July, when they dropped 2.6 percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said in a statement today. Economists forecast no change from the previous month, according to the median of 36 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. In the year, orders rose 3.9 percent when adjusted for work days. Concerns that Europe ’s debt crisis and slowing global growth could drag the economy back into recession may prompt companies to put off investment. European confidence in the economic outlook dropped to the lowest in almost two years last month. At the same time, German business sentiment fell less than forecast, suggesting Europe’s largest economy may be spared a slump. “There is the danger that the market nervousness about the debt situation will affect companies more strongly,” said Jens Kramer, an economist at NordLB in Hanover, Germany. “That doesn’t necessarily mean a recession. We shouldn’t talk one into existence.” While domestic factory orders fell 3.2 percent in August, the ministry said holidays affected demand and there was a below-average number of big-ticket sales. Orders from abroad rose 0.1 percent, with sales to other euro-area nations gaining 2.7 percent. Orders for investment goods declined 1.3 percent and orders for consumer goods dropped 5.6 percent. The drop in overall orders in July was revised from 2.8 percent. ‘One-Off Effects’ “Manufacturing demand has been influenced by one-off effects in recent months,” the ministry said. Demand in the three months through August compared with the previous three- month period showed a gain of 1.5 percent, it said. “Still, overall the orders dynamic has noticeably lost momentum.” Railroad equipment maker Vossloh AG (VOS) said on Sept. 29 that it reduced its sales forecast for 2011 for a second time due to lower orders from southern Europe and “weak” Chinese demand. At the same time, Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s largest maker of heavy-duty vehicles, said demand for Mercedes-Benz trucks hasn’t shown signs of being damped by slowing economic growth. “In spite of the debt crisis, we have good reason to be optimistic,” Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche said in a speech on Sept. 30. Mercedes-Benz truck plants will be working at full capacity through the end of this year and have “a good level” of orders for the first quarter, he said. Heightened Danger Euro-area services and manufacturing output shrank for the first time in more than two years in September. The euro-area economy may fail to gather strength in the current quarter, expanding 0.2 percent from the previous three months before cooling to 0.1 percent growth in the final quarter, the European Commission in Brussels forecast last month. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said on Sept. 26 there is a “heightened danger” that financial market turmoil caused by uncertainty over the debt crisis will begin to affect the real economy. European governments this week hinted that bondholders may be saddled with bigger losses on Greek debt, intensifying market jitters that a second aid package designed to quell the fiscal crisis might unravel. France and Belgium are considering a second bailout of Dexia SA (DEXB) after the crisis reduced its ability to obtain funding. While the Bundesbank’s current forecast is for the German economy to expand about 3 percent this year, it said last month that the outlook “has clouded more than previously expected.” “Growth in the second half of the year will be significantly weaker than in the first,” said Ralph Solveen , head of economic research at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “We still think that Germany will be able to dodge a recession.” To contact the reporter on this story: Jeff Black in Frankfurt at  Jblack25@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Craig Stirling at  cstirling1@bloomberg.net",['Jeff Black'],"German Factory Orders Unexpectedly Fall German factory orders unexpectedly fell for a second month in August as domestic demand waned.

While the Bundesbank’s current forecast is for the German economy to expand about 3 percent this year, it said last month that the outlook “has clouded more than previously expected.” “Growth in the second half of the year will be significantly weaker than in the first,” said Ralph Solveen , head of economic research at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “We still think that Germany will be able to dodge a recession.” To contact the reporter on this story: Jeff Black in Frankfurt at  Jblack25@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Craig Stirling at  cstirling1@bloomberg.net",4028,644,46,54.14149532710283,10,3,False,40,10,4,True,False,5.251552795031056,0,19,19,0,negative,0.9640908241271973,fear,0.9640908241271973,negative,0.9739739894866943,Percent Bank York Mercantile Exchange,2,Emerging

(AAPL) ’s future iPhones may look very different from present models, if a recently published patent application is any indication. The Cupertino, California-based company submitted an application, published in the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on March 28, for what it calls “an electronic device with wrap-around display.” According to application 20130076612 , the mobile device will have a flexible display housing that is enclosed in a transparent housing. Apple said any portion of the display can show visual content. The present configuration of most mobile devices leaves its sides and rear surfaces “unused or at best configured with buttons and switches with fixed location and functionality,” according to the application. Because many of the device’s buttons and switches have fixed functionality they can’t always be incorporated into third-party applications, Apple said. The aim of the new configuration would be to provide functionality on more than one surface, Apple said. The company applied for the patent in September 2011. Unlike many Apple patent applications or patents related to the appearance of the company’s products, the application doesn’t name the late Steve Jobs , the company founder, as an inventor.

Trademark Penn Accuses California Company of Being Wharton Imposter The University of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit accusing a California company of violating a trademark associated with the Wharton Business School. The Wharton Business Foundation, which has locations in Beverly Hills, California, and Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, is using Penn’s 132-year-old Wharton trademark without authorization, lawyers for the university said in a complaint made public March 28 in federal court in Philadelphia. The company’s use of the name “creates a likelihood of confusion in the marketplace,” the University of Pennsylvania said in its complaint. Wharton Business Foundation operates a website with the Wharton name and offers services including business education and business consultation through its Wharton Business Foundation University, according to the complaint. The company also advertises and has a toll-free phone number 888-4-WHARTON, the university said in its filing. Penn has been using the Wharton registered mark for business education since as early as 1881 and for business consultation since 1953, lawyers for the university said in the filing. According to the school’s website , the name comes from businessman and entrepreneur Joseph Wharton, who established “the world’s first collegiate school of business” at the university in 1881. The university is seeking a jury trial and a court order barring the misuse of its mark. Officials at the Wharton Business Foundation didn’t immediately return a phone message seeking comment on the complaint. The case is The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania v. Wharton Business Foundation, 13-cv-01616, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). Del Monte Barred From Some Labeling, Product-Dating Practices Del Monte Foods Co., the maker of canned fruit and pet products controlled by KKR & Co., is barred from using its trademark on refrigerated food products containing five specified kinds of fruit. A federal court in Manhattan told the San Francisco-based food company that it violated a licensing agreement with its 1989 spinoff Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. (FDP) , and falsely informed customers that some of its products that contained preservatives had to be refrigerated The order came in resolution of the contract-dispute suit Fresh filed against Del Monte in 2008. Fresh, based in Coral Gables, Florida, claimed that the California company breached a trademark licensing agreement. According to court papers, the agreement limited Del Monte Foods’ exclusive use of the Del Monte mark to preserved produce and gave Fresh the rights to use it with fresh fruit and vegetables. The dispute centered on the parties’ different interpretations of a license agreement with respect to refrigerated pineapple, melons, berries, papayas and bananas regardless of whether they are fresh or preserved. Following a jury verdict that Del Monte had violated trademark law with respect to some of the products, it gave Fresh a damages award of $7.2 million. Fresh then sought a court order controlling aspects of Del Monte’s packaging and marketing. In his March 28 order, U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein said Del Monte is barred from using the trademark on any product containing any of the five fruits that is intended to be refrigerated or chilled at the point of sale. If Del Monte’s customers are refrigerating these products, the California company is required to tell them in writing that they aren’t permitted to sell them under refrigeration. The company is also barred from pasteurizing or adding chemical preservatives to its fruit products without saying so. The judge said that while Del Monte didn’t have to add “‘Contains Preservatives’’ on the front label, it must state on the ingredient list that certain chemicals added are preservatives. Additionally, Del Monte cannot put ‘‘best by’’ or ‘‘sell by’’ dates on its products without test results that justify the existence of such a date, he said. The case is Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. v. Del Monte Foods Co., 08-cv-08718, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). ‘Star Wars’ Movie May Guide Big East on Selecting New Name Darth Vader might serve as inspiration for the Big East Conference, which must change its name after the so-called Catholic Seven leaves in three months and takes the league’s moniker with them. Among the names suggested by the marketing firm Duffy & Shanley when the conference formed in 1979 was Galactic East, which the company said was inspired by the 1977 movie ‘‘Star Wars.’’ Other suggestions were the Empire Conference, Conference One, Eastern One, Olympic Conference and Eastern Compact, according to the plan, a copy of which was provided to Bloomberg News by Dave Duffy, a partner in the firm at the time. Geographic-based suggestions were the Big East, Met-East and North Atlantic Alliance. Heritage-based suggestions were the Patriot Athletic Conference, Colonial League and Mayflower Compact. The firm’s principal recommendation was the Big East, which will be used by the seven departing schools that include Georgetown University , Villanova University and Providence College. Joseph Shanley, the father of current Providence College President Brian Shanley, was a partner in the marketing firm. ‘‘All the great brands of the world -- General Electric, Coca-Cola, they have a lot of roots,’’ Duffy, 73, said in a telephone interview from Florida. ‘‘It would be hard for the new basketball league to start over and match that.’’ Covington & Burling LLP attorney Marie Lavalleye, acting as a representative of the league, on March 6 filed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the term ‘‘America 12 Conference.’’ She didn’t return a telephone calling seeking comment on the name change. Duffy & Shanley, in the original marketing plan, said the conference’s name, at least in the beginning, shouldn’t include a number because conference members are sure to change, a recommendation he said is even more valid today with the realignment in college sports. Shanley, the Providence president, earlier this month said ‘‘the landscape in college sports has not stopped morphing.” Since 2011, the Big East has lost 16 schools that were either members or dropped out before playing a game. The Pac-10 Conference, meantime, became the Pac-12 after adding two schools. The Big Ten Conference hasn’t had 10 teams since Penn State University joined in 1990. While the Big Ten didn’t change its name at the time, it did alter its logo to reflect an 11th team. The current Big Ten has 12 football members and is adding more. DuPont Drops Trademark-Infringement Suit Against Easton-Bell DuPont Co. (DD) , the maker of Corian countertops and Tyvek packaging materials, dropped a trademark-infringement lawsuit against a California maker of sports equipment. The suit, filed Jan. 28 in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, accused Easton-Bell Sports Inc. of Scotts Valley, California, of infringing the chemical company’s “Kevlar” trademark. DuPont, based in Wilmington, said the size of the Kevlar trademark on Easton-Bell’s packaging was even larger than the California company’s own mark, according to the complaint Easton-Bell has sold and marketed bicycle tires and locks in packaging displaying the Kevlar trademark since July, according to court papers. Such products are sold through retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. (TGT) and Amazon.com Inc., DuPont said. Easton-Bell sued in federal court in San Francisco on Jan. 18, seeking a court declaration that it didn’t infringe the DuPont trademark. In its pleadings, Easton-Bell said it has bought Kevlar from authorized distributors and resellers for at least six years and used it in bike tires and locks. Indicating on its packaging that the products contain Kevlar “has no likelihood of causing confusion,” the company claimed. On March 26, a magistrate judge refused to dismiss Easton- Bell’s case and rejected DuPont’s request that the dispute be transferred to Delaware. He said that DuPont’s request for a transfer was inappropriate. Dupont didn’t give any reason for dropping its suit against Easton-Bell. According to the March 28 filing, Easton-Bell hadn’t answered the complaint or asked that the case be dismissed. The DuPont case is E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. Easton- Bell Sports Inc., 1:13-cv-00150, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). The earlier case is Easton-Bell Sports v. E.I.

Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage Obama Urged by Democrats to Act on China’s Alleged Cyber Thefts President Barack Obama ’s administration should take action to curb China’s alleged cyber theft, two House Democrats said, after a top U.S. official accused the Asian nation of industrial espionage against American companies. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office needs to designate China as a top violator of intellectual property rights, which can lead to further trade restrictions, Representatives Sander Levin of Michigan and Charles Rangel of New York said March 28 in a letter to Acting USTR Demetrios Marantis. “In the case of China, the government itself appears to be actively stealing the intellectual property of American businesses,” the lawmakers, ranking Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, which deals with trade issues, wrote. China’s cyber espionage against U.S. businesses is adding tension between the governments of the world’s two largest economies, Obama’s National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon said in a March 11 speech in New York. In their letter, Levin and Rangel cited a February report by Mandiant Corp., an Arlington, Virginia-based information security firm, that concluded the Chinese government is probably the source of recent hacking attacks. The lawmakers asked the USTR to list China in the annual assessment of intellectual property rights protection and enforcement in other nations, to be released about April 30. “We have received the letter and are reviewing it,” Carol Guthrie , a USTR spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The USTR will seek to toughen trade-secret protection through the annual assessment, the Obama administration said its strategy to mitigate violations, released in February. Intellectual-property protection is among the issues being negotiated as the U.S. seeks trade deals with 10 Pacific-region governments and the 27-nation European Union. Companies including New York-based Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) rely on enforcement of trade laws to protect their patents. Intellectual-property provisions shouldn’t be in a proposed U.S.-EU trade deal because they could raise health-care costs, limit free speech and restrict access to education materials, Washington-based consumer group Public Citizen said in a March 18 statement joined by other organizations. IP Moves Wilson Sonsini Expands IP Practice With Team of Five From Sidley Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati PC expanded its IP practice with the hiring of five patent litigators, the Palo Alto, California-based firm said in a statement.

Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage Obama Urged by Democrats to Act on China’s Alleged Cyber Thefts President Barack Obama ’s administration should take action to curb China’s alleged cyber theft, two House Democrats said, after a top U.S. official accused the Asian nation of industrial espionage against American companies. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office needs to designate China as a top violator of intellectual property rights, which can lead to further trade restrictions, Representatives Sander Levin of Michigan and Charles Rangel of New York said March 28 in a letter to Acting USTR Demetrios Marantis. “In the case of China, the government itself appears to be actively stealing the intellectual property of American businesses,” the lawmakers, ranking Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, which deals with trade issues, wrote. China’s cyber espionage against U.S. businesses is adding tension between the governments of the world’s two largest economies, Obama’s National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon said in a March 11 speech in New York. In their letter, Levin and Rangel cited a February report by Mandiant Corp., an Arlington, Virginia-based information security firm, that concluded the Chinese government is probably the source of recent hacking attacks. The lawmakers asked the USTR to list China in the annual assessment of intellectual property rights protection and enforcement in other nations, to be released about April 30. “We have received the letter and are reviewing it,” Carol Guthrie , a USTR spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The USTR will seek to toughen trade-secret protection through the annual assessment, the Obama administration said its strategy to mitigate violations, released in February. Intellectual-property protection is among the issues being negotiated as the U.S. seeks trade deals with 10 Pacific-region governments and the 27-nation European Union. Companies including New York-based Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) rely on enforcement of trade laws to protect their patents. Intellectual-property provisions shouldn’t be in a proposed U.S.-EU trade deal because they could raise health-care costs, limit free speech and restrict access to education materials, Washington-based consumer group Public Citizen said in a March 18 statement joined by other organizations. IP Moves Wilson Sonsini Expands IP Practice With Team of Five From Sidley Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati PC expanded its IP practice with the hiring of five patent litigators, the Palo Alto, California-based firm said in a statement. The five new hires all previously were with Chicago’s Sidley Austin LLP. They are Edward Poplawski, Vera Elson, Paul Tripodi II, Olivia M. Kim and Sandra S. Fujiyama. Poplawski , who headed Sidley’s West Coast IP practice, has litigated life-sciences and technology patent cases in federal courts and before the International Trade Commission, a Washington-based entity with the power to exclude imports of products that infringe U.S. intellectual property. He has an undergraduate degree and a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Drexel University and a law degree from Villanova University. Elson has previously practiced at Wilson Sonsini and at Chicago’s McDermott Will & Emery LLP. Before she was a lawyer, she was an electrical engineer at Hughes Aircraft’s Advanced Circuit Technology Labs. She has an undergraduate degree in cybernetics and a master’s degree in engineering from the University of California at Los Angeles and a law degree from the University of Southern California. Tripodi has practiced in both federal court and before the International Trade Commission. He has an undergraduate degree in chemistry from Pennsylvania State University, a master’s degree in chemical physics from the California Institute of Technology and a law degree from the University of California at Los Angeles. Kim has represented clients whose technologies have included biometric sensors, computer processor architecture, Internet payment systems and plasma display panels. She was a researcher at the University of California’s immunology and physiology labs before she became a lawyer. She has an undergraduate degree in biochemistry and a law degree from the University of California at Los Angeles. Fujiyama does patent and trademark acquisition work in addition to litigation.

"Banks to Sell $40 Billion of Assets Amid European Debt Crisis, KPMG Says",['Anne-Sylvaine Chassany'],2011-10-06 23:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/banks-to-sell-40b-of-assets-amid-eu-crisis.html,"European banks are planning to sell more than 30 billion euros ($40 billion) of assets as the debt crisis increases the need to raise capital, according KPMG LLP. European lenders are accelerating asset sales after disposing of more than 26 billion euros of loans this year, according to a KPMG study released today. While the amount has been far from the “flurry of activity that was widely expected,” regulatory pressures and a deepening of the European debt crisis is forcing lenders to accept lower prices, the report said. “Counter-intuitively, we saw a lower-than-expected level of bank disposals of loan portfolios in the first few years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,” said Andrew Jenke, director in KPMG’s Portfolio Solutions Group. “But we are now starting to see banks - faced with the triple- whammy of sovereign debt crises, increased capital requirements and a funding mismatch - under a lot more pressure to extract value from their loan books.” Banks including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) and Dexia SA (DEXB) , the French-Belgian bank that is facing a second government bailout in three years, are planning to sell assets because they are under pressure from regulators to shrink their balance sheets and boost liquidity. Lured by the prospect of buying portfolios at a discount, U.S. private-equity firms and hedge funds have raised more than $5 billion for funds targeting European distressed assets and corporate turnarounds compared with about $400 million during the 2002 recession, according to London-based researcher Preqin Ltd. Deals have been slow to materialize because lenders aren’t willing to sell at the discounts sought by investors. ‘Gap Is Narrowing’ “The pricing gap is still there,” Jenke said. “Banks are still expecting more than purchasers are able to pay for the assets. This gap is narrowing in some instances.” The U.K. and Irish banks remain the biggest sellers, according to KPMG. RBS agreed in July to sell part of a 1.4 billion-pound ($2.2 billion) portfolio of commercial loans to Blackstone Group LP. (BX)  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) is selling a 6 billion-pound portfolio of shipping loans, according to the report. Anglo Irish Bank Corp. said in August it expects to complete the sale of $9.65 billion of U.S. real-estate loans.

Oaktree Capital Management LP, the Los Angeles-based private-equity firm led by Howard Marks , is seeking as much as $3 billion for a fund that will buy assets in Europe , people with knowledge of the plans said previously. Hedge funds including New York-based Anchorage Capital Group LLC and Marathon Asset Management LP are also targeting Europe. Asset sales should accelerate in Spain , KPMG said. “The hottest topic over the past six months has been Spain,” the report said. “Local banks are seeking to shed non- core and non-performing loans and the impact of the caja restructuring is now starting to yield portfolio disposals.” To contact the reporter on this story: Anne-Sylvaine Chassany in Paris at  achassany@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Edward Evans at  eevans3@bloomberg.net",['Anne-Sylvaine Chassany'],"Banks to Sell $40 Billion of Assets Amid European Debt Crisis, KPMG Says European banks are planning to sell more than 30 billion euros ($40 billion) of assets as the debt crisis increases the need to raise capital, according KPMG LLP.

Volksbanken, whose decade-long, fivefold balance sheet expansion unraveled since 2008, will focus on supporting local cooperative banks under a plan negotiated with the EU, the Brussels-based European Commission said in a statement today. The lender will stop large corporate and real estate financing and subsidiaries not focused on the support functions. “I welcome the bank’s objective to focus on its core business of providing services to the local and regional” credit cooperatives, European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in the statement. “Making sure that banks that received state aid throughout the EU change their business model will help build a healthier financial sector.” Austria has spent about 12 billion euros ($15.6 billion) to bail out or support its banks since 2008 and has been told by ratings companies Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s that lenders are the biggest risk to its sovereign creditworthiness. The Alpine nation may miss its 2012 budget target because of additional capital needs at nationalized banks this year. Biggest Hole Volksbanken is responsible for the biggest chunk of taxpayer aid. Its Kommunalkredit unit, then co-owned by Franco- Belgian Dexia SA (DEXB) , was nationalized in 2008 and has since required capital and guarantees of 2.2 billion euros. Volksbanken itself received government capital injections of 1.25 billion euros in 2009 and 2012 and an asset guarantee of 100 million euros.

The next biggest hole into which the Austrian government is pumping cash is Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG, which was nationalized in December 2009 after then-owner BayernLB withdrew its support.

Egyptian Crackdown on Mursi Supporters Leaves Dozens Dead,['Maram Mazen' 'Maher Chmaytelli'],2013-07-27 08:59:02,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/egypt-orders-mursi-detained-for-links-to-hamas-militants.html,"Dozens of supporters of ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi were killed in clashes with police as the new rulers seek to consolidate control over the country and put an end to attacks on the armed forces. In Cairo, 75 pro-Mursi Egyptians were killed yesterday and early today and more than 1,000 injured, the state-run Middle East News Agency said. Most were shot, MENA said, citing medics at a field hospital in Rabaa el-Adawiya Square, where Mursi’s Muslim Brotherhood backers have held rallies since he was ousted by the military and detained on July 3. The Health Ministry said violence in the square itself during the early hours of today left 20 dead and 177 injured, MENA reported. Egyptian judicial authorities yesterday extended Mursi’s detention for 15 days after accusing him of conspiring with the Palestinian militant group Hamas in murders, abductions, jailbreaks and other attacks on the country’s security buildings, MENA said. The military said the day before that it would use new tactics against violence and terrorism starting today, without giving details. “What’s happening right now is an ugly massacre,” Omar Talaat, a doctor at the field hospital, told al-Jazeera TV. As the military’s deadline loomed, thousands of Mursi backers rallied in Cairo and other cities including Alexandria, while tens of thousands of his opponents met in the capital’s Tahrir Square and near the presidential palace. The gatherings yesterday followed a call the previous day by military chief Abdelfatah al-Seesi for Egyptians to take to the streets to give the armed forces and police a broad mandate to combat violence. ‘Reframe Conflict’ Al-Seesi’s request for Egyptians to rally was “designed to reframe the conflict with the Muslim Brotherhood as a war on terror,” Hani Sabra, Middle East director at the Eurasia Group in New York , said in an e-mailed statement. Mursi’s backers vowed today to press ahead with their demonstrations against what they call a “coup.” “The massacres and crimes committed against the free Egyptian people will not scare them and they will continue to protest peacefully until the coup is reversed and coup-ist leaders are brought to justice,” the Anti-Coup Alliance, comprising Brotherhood members and Islamist parties, said today in a statement in English. Mursi has been held at an undisclosed location since his ouster, which followed street protests against his rule by those who accused him of pursuing an Islamist agenda. His supporters have held daily demonstrations since his removal by the army, demanding the former president’s reinstatement. Before the latest violence, almost 100 people had died in clashes since Mursi was deposed. Palace Rally Thousands gathered yesterday by the presidential palace in Heliopolis, site of one of the rallies called by al-Seesi, as military helicopters hovered above. People waved Egyptian flags and carried posters of al-Seesi while chanting “Come down Seesi, you’re our president.” “He wanted the authority and we’re giving it to him,” said 26-year-old Ayman Rizkalla. “ Egypt is for all of us, not just the Islamists who were taking us to hell.” The unrest has roiled the country’s markets. Yields on Egypt’s 5.75 percent bonds maturing April 2020 rose 4 basis points to 8.60 percent yesterday, bringing this week’s increase to 15 basis points, the most in a month. Detaining “a legitimate president” without the presence of his lawyers “shows the nature of the military regime,” Essam El-Erian, vice chairman of the Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party, said yesterday on his Facebook page. Brotherhood’s Opponents Opponents of the Brotherhood, including youth groups and secular-leaning parties, accuse Islamists of deadly violence, including a surge in attacks by militants in the Sinai peninsula against military and police positions. Several armed supporters of Mursi were detained this week as they tried to attack a rival sit-in in Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak , state-run media reported. Clashes in Alexandria yesterday left seven people dead, Ahram Gate reported, citing Khalid el-Khatib, a senior official at the Health Ministry. A total of nine people were killed nationwide yesterday, MENA said. Police clashed with Mursi’s supporters in Cairo when they tried to block key roads serving the capital, the news agency said. ‘Increasingly Untenable’ “It’s becoming increasingly untenable for president Mursi to be detained for almost a month now without being charged with anything,” putting pressure on the authorities to announce a judicial process has begun, Yasser el-Shimy, a Cairo-based analyst with the International Crisis Group , said yesterday by phone. “It’s likely to inflame the sentiments of the pro-Mursi crowd.” Mursi was accused of escaping and assisting others to escape from Wadi al-Natrun jail, where he was detained before the 2011 uprising, according to a judicial statement yesterday. He was questioned over the allegations and was presented with evidence, MENA said. President Barack Obama ’s administration, in a move that may protect U.S. aid to Egypt, has concluded that it doesn’t have to make a formal determination on whether Mursi’s ouster was a coup, a State Department official said. Making such a determination, which potentially would have required cutting off aid, wouldn’t be in the U.S. national interest, State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said yesterday. Egypt is a stabilizing force in the region, and it’s to the U.S.’s advantage to continue providing aid, she said. Obama had asked U.S. agencies on July 3 to review whether Mursi’s removal required halting about $1.5 billion in U.S. aid, of which $1.3 billion is military assistance. A U.S. law requires the denial of “any assistance to the government of any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by a military coup d’etat or decree,” or a coup “in which the military plays a decisive role.” “Our national security interests influence our policy as it relates to aid with Egypt,” Psaki told reporters at a State Department briefing. “We reviewed the legal obligations and determined we did not need to make a determination one way or the other.” To contact the reporters on this story: Maher Chmaytelli in Dubai at  mchmaytelli@bloomberg.net ; Maram Mazen in Cairo at  mmazen@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Dick Schumacher at  dschumacher@bloomberg.net",['Maram MazenMaher Chmaytelli'],"Egyptian Crackdown on Mursi Supporters Leaves Dozens Dead Dozens of supporters of ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi were killed in clashes with police as the new rulers seek to consolidate control over the country and put an end to attacks on the armed forces.

Police clashed with Mursi’s supporters in Cairo when they tried to block key roads serving the capital, the news agency said. ‘Increasingly Untenable’ “It’s becoming increasingly untenable for president Mursi to be detained for almost a month now without being charged with anything,” putting pressure on the authorities to announce a judicial process has begun, Yasser el-Shimy, a Cairo-based analyst with the International Crisis Group , said yesterday by phone. “It’s likely to inflame the sentiments of the pro-Mursi crowd.” Mursi was accused of escaping and assisting others to escape from Wadi al-Natrun jail, where he was detained before the 2011 uprising, according to a judicial statement yesterday. He was questioned over the allegations and was presented with evidence, MENA said. President Barack Obama ’s administration, in a move that may protect U.S. aid to Egypt, has concluded that it doesn’t have to make a formal determination on whether Mursi’s ouster was a coup, a State Department official said. Making such a determination, which potentially would have required cutting off aid, wouldn’t be in the U.S. national interest, State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said yesterday. Egypt is a stabilizing force in the region, and it’s to the U.S.’s advantage to continue providing aid, she said. Obama had asked U.S. agencies on July 3 to review whether Mursi’s removal required halting about $1.5 billion in U.S. aid, of which $1.3 billion is military assistance. A U.S. law requires the denial of “any assistance to the government of any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by a military coup d’etat or decree,” or a coup “in which the military plays a decisive role.” “Our national security interests influence our policy as it relates to aid with Egypt,” Psaki told reporters at a State Department briefing. “We reviewed the legal obligations and determined we did not need to make a determination one way or the other.” To contact the reporters on this story: Maher Chmaytelli in Dubai at  mchmaytelli@bloomberg.net ; Maram Mazen in Cairo at  mmazen@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Dick Schumacher at  dschumacher@bloomberg.net",6514,1026,57,43.17530137120471,8,5,True,30,7,3,False,False,5.346003898635478,-1,1,-1,-1,negative,0.5795572996139526,sadness,0.5795572996139526,negative,0.8871475458145142,,0,
Goldman Names 266 Managing Directors in Annual Promotion,['Christine Harper'],2012-11-15 18:45:30,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/goldman-names-266-managing-directors-in-annual-promotion.html,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) promoted 266 employees to managing director, up from 261 last year, as the fifth-biggest U.S. bank seeks to reward staff even as it pares expenses. The annual promotions, which take effect Jan. 1, come one day after New York-based Goldman Sachs named 70 people to its so-called partnership, the fewest since the firm became a public company in 1999. Partners, also called participating managing directors, receive a higher salary than managing directors and share in a special bonus pool. Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, has undertaken a $1.9 billion expense-reduction effort since the middle of last year as higher capital requirements and weak revenue growth cut return on equity. The company employed 32,600 people at the end of September, 3,100 fewer than at the end of 2010. The investment bank expects that 7.2 percent of employees will be managing directors at the start of 2013, unchanged from a year earlier, according to Michael DuVally , a Goldman Sachs spokesman. Managing directors typically receive a base salary of $500,000, lower than the $900,000 granted to partners. Both also get bonuses that can boost their total compensation into the millions of dollars. Geographical Mix The number of employees named managing director is down from a record 321 in 2010. About 58 percent of those just promoted are based in the Americas, 26 percent in Europe , Middle East and Africa, and 17 percent in Asia, DuVally said. Last year, about 46 percent were in the Americas, 30 percent in EMEA and 23 percent in Asia. Women comprise 23 percent of the incoming class of managing directors, up from 19 percent in 2011 and down from 24 percent in 2010. The firm said yesterday that 10 of the 70 new partners, or 14 percent, are women. Goldman Sachs, which announced today’s promotions in a statement, created the non-partner managing director title in 1996 to recognize top employees who weren’t yet partners. That first class of 87 managing directors included William C. Dudley, now president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ; Clifford S. Asness, who left in 1998 to start hedge fund AQR Capital Management LLC; and Richard J. Gnodde, who was named co-head of global investment banking at Goldman Sachs in May 2011.

Christie Relying on Web Bets for N.J. Budget Seen as Risk,['Terrence Dopp'],2013-03-11 00:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/christie-relying-on-web-bets-for-n-j-budget-seen-as-risk.html,"Governor Chris Christie is betting New Jersey’s new online-gambling law will propel an 85 percent jump in casino-tax collections next fiscal year. He faces a skeptical group of analysts and lawmakers. The governor’s 2014 budget anticipates a $1.2 billion market from Internet bets in its first year. Analysts at Moody’s Investors Service, Deutsche Bank AG and Bloomberg Industries all say that sounds too optimistic, with their estimates ranging from $250 million to about $850 million. Christie, a 50-year-old Republican seeking a second term, missed his target for more than 8 percent revenue growth this year as sales, corporate and casino revenue fell short, forcing him to abandon an income-tax cut. Next year he’s counting on a smaller 4.9 percent gain, which depends in part on Internet wagers taking off to help Atlantic City rebound from six straight years of decline. “You have to be realistic, and I’d think by this time he’d err on the side of caution,” said Assembly Budget Chairman Vincent Prieto, a Democrat from Secaucus. “If he doesn’t make those numbers, clearly we are going to have to cut somewhere in the middle of next year.” Christie has made an Atlantic City revival a centerpiece of his first term, saying casinos are crucial to New Jersey ’s economic recovery. He created state-run tourism districts and extended $261 million in tax credits to jump-start development of the first new casino in nine years, by Revel Entertainment Group LLC. Revel opened in April, failed to meet earnings expectations and is planning a prepackaged bankruptcy to erase more than $1 billion in debt. Below Targets The governor’s $32.9 billion spending plan, the final one of his first term, will take effect four months before Election Day. His budget would delay property-tax rebates to close the current year’s deficit as he increases spending on schools and pensions, and expands Medicaid. A year ago, Christie proposed a budget that predicted the state’s collections from the 8 percent tax on Atlantic City ’s casinos would jump 16 percent in fiscal 2013, which began July 1. Through February, that revenue was 28 percent below target. Christie, who vetoed Internet betting in 2011, reversed course this year and legalized it to fend off competition from nearby states that have expanded gambling. His authorization set off a national horse race over an online market that’s forecast to reach $7.4 billion in five years. ‘Long Shot’ “It’s a long shot,” said Gene Johnson, a senior vice president at Spectrum Gaming Group LLC, a casino research and consulting firm in Linwood, New Jersey. “I can’t see them reaching that $1.2 billion figure.” New Jersey became the most populous state to legalize online gambling, following action by Nevada and Delaware. Other states may follow after a 2011 Justice Department opinion said the Federal Wire Act, which prohibits the use of wires to transfer bets, applies only to sporting events or contests, said Brian C. Miller and Tim Craighead, gaming analysts for Bloomberg Industries. Delaware probably will be the first to roll out online gaming, by September, while Nevada may follow by year-end, said Andrew Zarnett, a gaming analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. In Pennsylvania , whose Philadelphia-area casinos have siphoned gamblers from Atlantic City, Representative Tina Davis, a Bristol Democrat, plans to introduce a bill to establish Internet gambling this week. Two Years Implementation in New Jersey may take as long as two years, Zarnett estimated in a Feb. 28 report. Gary Loveman, chief executive officer of Caesars Entertainment (CZR) Co., gave a similar time frame during a Feb. 25 conference call. Delaware estimates an additional $9 million of tax revenue from online betting in its first full fiscal year after implementation, according to Moody’s. Christie is expecting to collect $180 million from a 15 percent tax on online casino revenue in fiscal 2014, according to his budget summary. Miller and Craighead estimate that online gambling would result in $128 million of state taxes, though only if fully rolled out by July 1. “He is in trouble,” Senator Raymond Lesniak, an Elizabeth Democrat who sponsored New Jersey’s online gambling bill, said of Christie’s forecast. Lesniak said he projects first-year tax collections of about $45 million, based on operators posting about $300 million in revenue. Being Kind “I’m being kind when I say optimistic -- I mean unrealistic,” Lesniak said. “I just don’t see how a couple of hundred million dollars going into the state treasury can be reached. And I’m the main proponent of this.” Casinos account for more than two-thirds of the tax base in Atlantic City, where a quarter of its 40,000 residents live in poverty. The seaside city was a bustling resort until the 1960s, when it became riddled with crime and corruption. The state approved casinos in 1976 to boost the city’s ailing finances. The $2.6 billion Revel has fallen short of its own expectations, ranking next to last in January gambling revenue among the city’s 12 casinos, the state reported Feb. 11. Under the bankruptcy agreement with lenders, the casino will restructure to erase more than $1 billion in debt. Christie also signed a law last year to allow wagering on professional and college sports in Atlantic City and at racetracks. A federal judge this month ruled against the governor, siding with groups including the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the National Football League that sued to block the legislation from taking effect. Sports Books Sports-book wagers account for one-third of the $30 billion Internet gaming industry, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, Christie said his budget projections weren’t counting on sports wagering. “Our revenue projections were based upon the institution of Internet gaming and what we think will be a generally better nature of the economy in the next year which will lead to more people having more disposable income and gambling more,” Christie told reporters on March 4 in Jersey City. Christie said March 4 that the state will file an appeal of the court ruling and that he anticipates the case will take two years to be resolved before the U.S. Supreme Court. “Without sports betting, I don’t see New Jersey getting to a billion-dollar industry, especially not in the next five years,” said Spectrum’s Johnson. “I’m not going to say that I understand the governor’s thought process.” To contact the reporter on this story: Terrence Dopp in Trenton at  tdopp@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephen Merelman at  smerelman@bloomberg.net",['Terrence Dopp'],"Christie Relying on Web Bets for N.J.

"ECB Says Economists Cut Growth Outlook, Raise Price Forecast",['Gabi Thesing'],2012-11-15 09:44:18,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/ecb-says-economists-cut-growth-outlook-raise-price-forecast-1-.html,"The European Central Bank said professional forecasters cut their estimates for the euro-area economy while raising their inflation expectations.

Forecasters lowered their estimate for 2013 growth to 0.3 percent from 0.6 percent and their projection for 2014 to 1.3 percent from 1.4 percent, the ECB said. Inflation is seen at 2.5 percent this year and 1.9 percent next year, up from 2.3 percent and 1.7 percent respectively. European policy makers are trying to contain a sovereign debt crisis that has pushed five countries into seeking bailouts and taken the 17-nation euro economy to the brink of recession. The ECB said the economic outlook for the euro area remains “weak” as the debt crisis undermines confidence. “It is essential for governments to support confidence by forcefully implementing the necessary steps to reduce both fiscal and structural imbalances and to proceed with financial sector restructuring,” the central bank said in its monthly bulletin today, which echoes President Mario Draghi ’s Nov. 8 policy statement. The ECB in September unveiled a new government bond purchasing program called Outright Monetary Transactions aimed at stemming surging borrowing costs in Spain and Italy. Yields have since fallen even though neither country has asked for the program to be activated. Still, “we are ready to undertake OMTs, which will help to avoid extreme scenarios, thereby clearly reducing concerns about the materialization of destructive forces,” the ECB said. Inflation risks are “broadly balanced” over the medium term and the inflation rate should fall below 2 percent, the ECB’s definition of price stability , “over the course of next year,” the ECB said.

Full Tilt Poker Pay Processor Burtnick Pleads Guilty,['Patricia Hurtado'],2012-09-19 17:58:49,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/full-tilt-poker-pay-processor-burtnick-pleads-guilty.html,"Nelson Burtnick, the head of payment processing for poker website Full Tilt Poker , pleaded guilty to taking part in a scheme to deceive banks into handling Internet gambling transactions that violated U.S. laws. Burtnick, 41, a Canadian citizen, told U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein in New York today that U.S. banks would have refused to process such payments for Ireland-based Full Tilt Poker had they known the transactions were illegal. Burtnick admitted committing the crimes while working at both Isle of Man-based PokerStars and later at Full Tilt. “We had to do this type of deception to enable U.S. poker players to load their accounts” with funds, Burtnick told the magistrate. “I know that what I did was wrong.” Burtnick faces as long as 15 years in prison when he is sentenced by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan , Gorenstein said. No sentencing date was set. Kelly Currie, a lawyer for Burtnick, declined to comment on the plea after court. Prosecutors allege that after the U.S. implemented the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act in 2006, barring banks from processing payments to offshore gaming sites, the founders and employees of Full Tilt Poker, PokerStars and Absolute Poker worked around the ban. In July, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara , whose office is prosecuting the case, as well as a civil suit against the three gambling companies, announced a $731 million settlement with PokerStars and Full Tilt.

McAlpine May Sue Twitter Users,['Kitty Donaldson' 'Kristen Schweizer'],2012-11-15 21:46:16,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/mcalpine-may-sue-twitter-users-after-bbc-abuse-settlement-2-.html,"The British Broadcasting Corp. settled with a U.K. politician for 185,000 pounds ($293,000) plus costs after he was wrongly linked to child sex-abuse allegations in a news report. Alistair McAlpine, a former Tory party treasurer, agreed to the settlement, according to an e-mailed statement from the BBC. “The BBC has agreed to terms with Lord McAlpine to settle his claim of libel against the Corporation,” the company said in the statement. “The settlement is comprehensive and reflects the gravity of the allegations that were wrongly made.” McAlpine said he would also be filing lawsuits against people who identified him on Twitter Inc. unless they apologize, he said on the “World at One” radio program today. A BBC “Newsnight” program earlier this month that aired false claims about a politician by an abuse victim caused more legal issues for the license-fee-funded broadcaster as top news executives have stepped aside and Director General George Entwistle resigned. “Newsnight” looked into abuse at child- care homes in Wales in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in McAlpine being identified online as the alleged abuser. “What we’re basically saying to people is, look, we know - - in inverted commas -- who you are, we know exactly the extent of what you’ve done,” Andrew Reid, McAlpine’s lawyer, said. “And it’s easier to come forward and see us and apologize and arrange to settle with us because, in the long run, this is the cheapest and best way to bring this matter to an end.” ‘Hopeful’ “This is the legacy that sadly the BBC has left me with,” McAlpine said. “I’m 70 years old,” he said, adding that he has heart problems. U.K. media regulator Ofcom said it would start an investigation into “Newsnight” and commercial broadcaster ITV Plc (ITV) ’s “This Morning” program to examine violations of privacy and unfair treatment. “This Morning” was criticized after host Phillip Schofield passed a list of accused pedophiles, which was briefly visible on camera, to Prime Minister David Cameron on the show last week. Schofield and the program’s staff have been disciplined, the channel’s U.K. editor said today. “It’s all very well Phillip Schofield being the fall guy for this decision, but one assumes that there must have been some kind of legal advice that this was appropriate and it must have been approved at a higher level,” John Whittingdale, the Conservative lawmaker who chairs Parliament’s media-oversight committee, told “The World at One.” ‘Radical Overhaul’ The head of the BBC’s supervisory body has called for a “radical overhaul” of the 90-year-old media organization that runs the U.K.’s most-watched TV channels. The broadcaster is conducting two investigations, one into the McAlpine “Newsnight” program and another addressing why a “Newsnight” report investigating sex-abuse claims against entertainer Jimmy Savile was canceled last year. The inquiries also will look into the role of executives such as Mark Thompson, Entwistle’s predecessor. Police arrested an unidentified man in his 60s today in connection with their investigation around Savile. The Daily Telegraph and other newspapers identified the man as a former BBC radio and television presenter, Dave Lee Travis. Assault Allegations To date, 450 victims come forward and 200 allegations of sexual assault have been made, the Metropolitan Police Service said. One abuse victim on the “Newsnight” program, Steve Messham, has apologized to McAlpine, Tory treasurer during Margaret Thatcher’s leadership, saying he didn’t assault him. McAlpine criticized the editorial standards of “Newsnight.” BBC Scotland Director Ken MacQuarrie, who was asked by the broadcaster’s Executive Board to investigate the circumstances around the Nov. 2 “Newsnight” story, said “basic journalistic checks were not completed.” “Of course they should have called me and I would have told them exactly what they learned later on -- that it was complete rubbish,” McAlpine told “The World at One.” “They could have saved themselves a lot of agonizing and money, actually, if they’d just made that telephone call.” Sally Bercow, the wife of the speaker of the House of Commons, was among the social-media users who linked McAlpine to the BBC report. “Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *Innocent face*” -- a reference to the fact his name was being repeatedly mentioned on Twitter, she said in a Nov. 4 Twitter post. She has since apologized. Sky News television reported that Bercow would be the first to receive a legal letter from McAlpine’s representatives. Calls and an e-mail to McAlpine’s lawyer weren’t immediately returned. Bercow reacted to the report by taking to Twitter again. “I guess I’d better get some legal advice then,” she said in a posting. “Still maintain was not a libelous tweet -- just foolish.” To contact the reporters on this story: Kitty Donaldson in London at  kdonaldson1@bloomberg.net ; Kristen Schweizer in London at  kschweizer1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: James Hertling at  jhertling@bloomberg.net",['Kitty DonaldsonKristen Schweizer'],"McAlpine May Sue Twitter Users The British Broadcasting Corp. settled with a U.K. politician for 185,000 pounds ($293,000) plus costs after he was wrongly linked to child sex-abuse allegations in a news report.

Cohen’s SAC Career Faces End as SEC Presses Supervision,['Katherine Burton' 'Joshua Gallu'],2013-07-20 04:00:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/sec-sues-cohen-for-failure-to-supervise-traders.html,"Billionaire hedge-fund manager Steven A. Cohen faces an attempt by U.S. regulators to force him out of business for failing to supervise two employees charged with insider trading. The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday presented new details that it said showed Cohen received “highly suspicious” information that should have caused any reasonable hedge-fund manager to investigate the basis for trades made by Mathew Martoma and Michael Steinberg. Cohen, 57, ignored red flags and allowed illegal trades that earned profits and avoided losses of more than $275 million, the SEC said in an administrative proceeding. “Hedge-fund managers are responsible for exercising appropriate supervision over their employees to ensure that their firms comply with the securities laws,” Andrew Ceresney, co-director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said in a statement. “After learning about red flags indicating potential insider trading by his employees, Steven Cohen allegedly failed to follow up to prevent violations of the law.” If its proceedings are successful, the SEC said it would seek to bar Cohen, who boasts one of the best long-term track records in history, from managing money for investors. The move could effectively end his hedge-fund career even though the SEC isn’t pursuing insider-trading claims against him personally. SAC, based in Stamford , Connecticut , oversees $15 billion, about 60 percent of which is money from Cohen and employees. Cohen hasn’t been charged criminally despite a multiyear probe by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Unsurpassed Record Cohen, whose net worth is estimated at about $9 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , has returned 25 percent a year in his funds since founding his firm in 1992 -- after taking half of the profits in fees -- a record unsurpassed by any other equity hedge-fund manager. “The SEC’s administrative proceeding has no merit,” Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC, said in a statement. “ Steve Cohen acted appropriately at all times and will fight this charge vigorously. The SEC ignores SAC’s exceptional supervisory structure, its extensive compliance policies and procedures, and Steve Cohen’s strong support for SAC’s compliance program.” The SEC moved against Cohen four months after his firm agreed to pay $616 million to settle a complaint of insider trading by Martoma and Steinberg, without admitting or denying wrongdoing. At least nine current and former employees of SAC have been linked to insider trading while working at the firm. Elan, Dell The SEC’s five-year statute of limitations deadline to sue Cohen for a series of trades sparked by Martoma’s tip expires this month. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said this week that prosecutors have an arsenal of statutes to bring securities fraud and insider trading charges and aren’t limited to a five-year deadline. The Martoma case, which centered on trades in drugmakers Elan Corp. (ELN) and Wyeth Inc., was the first to link Cohen directly to alleged inside information. Martoma, who has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go on trial Nov. 4, allegedly received inside information on the drug trial from Dr. Sid Gilman, who was involved in the trial of an Alzheimer’s drug. The SEC’s administrative action showed that the U.S. has amassed more evidence against Cohen than was previously known. Cohen knew that his employees were talking to at least one doctor about the trial, the SEC alleged in its order. ‘No Concern’ On April 11 and April 12, 2008, two unnamed analysts told Cohen they had a conversation with a doctor who they said implied he had seen some confidential phase II trial data on the Alzheimer’s drug being developed by Wyeth and Elan and that it did not have a statistically significant effect on patients. “During his e-mail exchanges with the analysts, Cohen displayed no concern about the apparent disclosure of nonpublic information by the doctor to the analysts or about the analysts’ use of such information to inform their investment decisions on the firm’s behalf,” the SEC said. Cohen then asked Martoma to speak with the unnamed doctor, the SEC said in its order. Martoma came back and said the information was a “non issue.” Cohen replied: “How come?” The SEC didn’t say in its order how Martoma responded. During that time, Martoma was getting nonpublic information from another doctor, Gilman, the SEC said. The SEC also said in its order that Cohen got and traded on a tip about Dell Inc. (DELL) that was forwarded to him by Steinberg. Cohen sold off more than $11 million in Dell stock within minutes of getting a copy of a “highly suspicious” e-mail from Jon Horvath, Steinberg’s analyst. White ‘Unrelenting’ Steinberg was indicted in March on charges of conspiracy and securities fraud. The U.S. alleges he engaged in insider trading in Dell based on illicit tips provided to him by Horvath. Steinberg has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go to trial in November. Horvath pleaded guilty and is cooperating with the U.S. The SEC’s order -- the first time ever that government has brought an action against Cohen personally -- coincided with news that the regulator had rejected a proposed $18 million settlement with hedge-fund manager Philip Falcone as too lenient, suggesting its new Chairman Mary Jo White is following through on a pledge to run a “bold and unrelenting” enforcement program. Falcone’s Deal Falcone in April agreed to a two-year suspension from investing client money in order to settle claims that he improperly borrowed money from his fund to pay his taxes. White and Democrats Luis A. Aguilar and Elisse B. Walter, in a 3-to-1 vote, were concerned that Falcone wasn’t barred from serving as officer or director of a public company, said two people briefed on the matter, asking not to be named because the deliberations aren’t public. Failure to supervise claims, such as brought against Cohen yesterday, are most commonly seen in cases targeting abusive sales practices at brokerages. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission used a similar provision in its June lawsuit against Jon Corzine when it accused him of failing of supervise employees who misused customer funds at now-defunct MF Global Holdings Ltd. Failure to supervise claims can only be brought administratively and will be heard by an administrative judge within the SEC, not in a federal court like civil insider-trading allegations would. Cohen had previously considered offering the government a deferred prosecution agreement under which SAC would admit wrongdoing and become a family office, but wouldn’t be prosecuted unless it broke the law again, a person familiar with his thinking told Bloomberg News in May. SAC, which initially cooperated with the investigation, told clients in May that it will no longer do so unconditionally. Cohen last month declined to testify before a grand jury about allegations of insider trading at SAC. His firm has said it doesn’t plan to stop managing outside money even after clients pulled billions of dollars amid the investigation.

Putin May Weaken Gazprom’s Natural-Gas Export Grip in Future,['Scott Rose' 'Stephen Bierman'],2011-10-06 17:03:58,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/russia-may-liberalize-gas-export-monopoly-in-future-putin-says.html,"Russia “doesn’t exclude” allowing natural-gas producers other than OAO Gazprom, the state export monopoly, to ship the fuel abroad eventually after European Union investigations into possible antitrust violations. “European colleagues are pushing us to do so with unending searches at Gazprom’s companies,” Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said, referring to raids by EU regulators last month on gas companies across the continent. Russia has no plans to end Gazprom’s legally enshrined hold on exports at present, Putin said at an investment conference today in Moscow. While such a move now might boost exports, it would also damp prices, he said. Gazprom gained a legal monopoly on exports in 2006 as the government sought to prevent domestic competition from undermining prices and oil producers raised output of the cleaner-burning fuel. Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas producer, has been trying to diversify away from Europe , where it supplies 25 percent of the market’s gas, with routes to Asia and the Pacific. “The biggest beneficiary of this would likely be Novatek, which seems already to be working on establishing a client base abroad,” Pavel Sorokin, an oil and gas analyst at Alfa Bank , said by phone from Moscow. “If Russia moves in the direction of liberalization, this might help Novatek gain market shares.” Yamal LNG Exports OAO Novatek, Russia’s second-largest gas producer, supplies natural gas only in the domestic market. It has gained support from the government and Gazprom for potential exports of liquefied natural gas from the Yamal LNG project with Total SA, which is slated to start in 2016. Novatek will pay Gazprom to ship the fuel abroad. Exxon Mobil Corp., which has the right to export gas under a production sharing agreement with the government, hasn’t yet developed supplies to China as initially planned, while Gazprom pushes the Irving, Texas-based explorer to sell gas from the Sakhalin-1 project for domestic use. OAO Rosneft could add as much as 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves if it had better access to gas pipelines and customers, Peter O’Brien , a former vice president at the state-controlled oil producer, said on Feb 2.

Kenya May Hold Benchmark Rate Amid Disputed Vote Outcome,['Sarah Mc Gregor'],2013-03-11 21:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/kenya-may-hold-benchmark-rate-amid-disputed-vote-outcome.html,"Kenya’s central bank will probably keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged for the first time since July as a dispute over presidential election results clouds the outlook for the economy. The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee led by central bank Governor Njuguna Ndung’u will hold the benchmark interest rate at 9.5 percent, according to all nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The bank is scheduled to announce its decision in an e-mailed statement later today. Policy makers are meeting three days after the electoral commission declared Uhuru Kenyatta, who was indicted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, as Kenya’s new president. The 51-year-old outgoing deputy prime minister won 50.07 percent of votes cast, narrowly avoiding a runoff with Raila Odinga. Odinga plans to ask the Supreme Court to overturn the result, citing evidence of ballot tampering. “They will give pause this time because of the results of the election have just been declared and there is still a level of uncertainty with the expected court challenge,” Yvonne Mhango, an economist for sub-Saharan Africa at Renaissance Capital , said in a phone interview from Johannesburg. “The bank will want to be cautious and see the impact on markets, especially on the shilling.” The shilling has strengthened 0.4 percent against the dollar since the March 4 election, bringing its gains so far this year to 0.6 percent. The election was largely free of the violence that tainted the last national vote in 2007, when accusations of vote-rigging sparked two months of ethnic and political clashes that left more than 1,100 dead and drove another 350,000 from their homes. Inflation Target The Central Bank of Kenya cut its key lending rate by 8.5 percentage points in the past four meetings as slower inflation enabled policy makers to help spur growth in East Africa’s biggest economy. While inflation accelerated for the second month in February to 4.5 percent, it remains below the government’s 5 percent target. The outlook for inflation is improving, giving the bank room to resume rate cuts in May, Razia Khan , head of African economic research at Standard Chartered Plc in London, said in an e-mailed note to clients. “An unchanged decision in March does not mean the end of Kenya’s easing cycle,” she said. “But clearly any further easing will depend very much on circumstances post-election.” To contact the reporter on this story: Sarah McGregor in Nairobi at  smcgregor5@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Nasreen Seria at  nseria@bloomberg.net",['Sarah Mc Gregor'],"Kenya May Hold Benchmark Rate Amid Disputed Vote Outcome Kenya’s central bank will probably keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged for the first time since July as a dispute over presidential election results clouds the outlook for the economy.

Central Banks in Europe Extend Global Drive to Prevent a Renewed Recession,['Scott Lanman' 'Simon Kennedy'],2011-10-06 22:00:09,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/central-banks-in-europe-extend-global-drive-to-prevent-a-renewed-recession.html,"Europe ’s leading central banks returned to crisis-fighting mode, expanding a push by global monetary-policy makers to support economies and financial markets while fiscal authorities struggle to act. The European Central Bank , after a meeting yesterday in Berlin, said it would reintroduce purchases of covered bonds and yearlong loans for banks to support markets rattled by the region’s sovereign-debt crisis. In London, the Bank of England boosted its asset-purchase program by more than a third to 275 billion pounds ($424 billion) in a bid to avert a new recession in the U.K. International central bankers are softening their anti- inflation stances or reviving programs to keep financial systems liquid as they race to keep slumping growth from turning into a full-fledged contraction. The Federal Reserve has eased policy two months in a row, while central banks in Malaysia and South Korea have refrained from raising rates as they focus on maintaining growth over damping price increases. “There has been a recent shift in central banking across the world, in the West toward easing and in emerging markets putting tightening on hold with an option to ease if necessary,” said Gerard Lyons , London-based chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank. The fiscal and monetary policy “cupboard is almost bare in the West, so pressure is on the central banks to do more of the heavy lifting.” Australia ’s central bank signaled Oct. 4 it has scope to lower the highest benchmark interest rate among developed economies if necessary as inflation pressures ease. Turkey and Russia stepped up sales of foreign-currency reserves this week. Risk Aversion “We have a substantial increase in risk aversion, and that is affecting flows into the emerging markets and their economies,” said Ted Truman, a former Fed official and assistant Treasury secretary, who’s now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “Many of their currencies are weakening, and there’s a recognition that the global economy which they live off of is slowing down.” Brazil plans moderate interest-rate reductions after a surprise cut Aug. 31 to 12 percent, a government official familiar with monetary policy said this week on condition of anonymity. Last week, Israel’s central bank lowered its benchmark rate for the first time in 2 1/2 years, to 3 percent. The Fed said last month it would replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in a program dubbed Operation Twist. In August, the central bank said its benchmark interest rate would probably stay near zero through at least mid-2013, amending previous language for a less-specific “extended period.” Additional Easing Additional easing may be in the offing. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) economists last week forecast the average interest rate of developed economies, weighted for gross domestic product, will fall to 0.62 percent by the end of the year from 0.80 percent. In emerging markets, it will drop to 5.80 percent from 5.93 percent. “We’re going to see further measures,” said Tim Drayson, a global economist at Legal & General Investment Management in London. “There’s clearly more scope for the Fed for going to QE3, and the ECB can cut rates,” he said, referring to a third round of quantitative easing, or large-scale asset purchases. The euro reversed losses after the ECB’s rate decision to rise 0.7 percent to $1.3437 at 5 p.m. in New York. The pound lost 0.1 percent against the dollar to $1.5445. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks rose 1.8 percent to 1,164.97 at 4 p.m. Final Meeting ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet , overseeing his final monetary-policy decision before retiring, said at a Berlin press conference yesterday that the central bank will spend 40 billion euros ($54 billion) on covered bonds starting next month and will offer banks two additional unlimited loans of 12 and 13- month durations. He also said the ECB will continue to lend banks as much money as they need in its regular refinancing operations at least until July 2012. Policy makers left the benchmark interest rate at 1.5 percent, where it’s been since July 7. With inflation accelerating to 3 percent last month, the ECB is resisting calls to reverse this year’s two quarter-point rate increases even amid speculation a recession is impending, Greece edges toward default and investors express concern about potential European bank losses. The ECB is the first line of support for markets as European governments piece together a new plan to solve their region’s debt strains. ‘Intensified Downside Risks’ “Ongoing tensions in financial markets and unfavorable effects on financing conditions are likely to dampen the pace of economic growth in the euro area in the second half of this year,” Trichet said. There are “intensified downside risks” to the economic outlook, he said. The Bank of England ’s nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, led by Governor Mervyn King , raised the ceiling for so-called quantitative easing from 200 billion pounds. That’s the biggest expansion since the first round of stimulus in March 2009. Only 11 of 32 economists in a Bloomberg News survey predicted an increase in asset purchases. The central bank acted a day after a report showed Europe’s second-biggest economy grew less than previously estimated in the quarter through June. The pledge to buy the most bonds since the depths of the credit crisis shows King and his colleagues are prioritizing the recovery over the threat from inflation, which is running more than double the central bank’s target. The onus to boost expansion is on Bank of England as the nation’s government remains committed to delivering the toughest fiscal squeeze since World War II. Vietnam , Kenya  Not every country is considering easier monetary policy. Vietnam’s central bank yesterday said it would lift its refinancing rate by a percentage point to 15 percent. The Central Bank of Kenya raised its benchmark interest rate this week by four percentage points to 11 percent. Other emerging market central banks have room to join developed economies in providing stimulus if growth falters, said Lyons at Standard Chartered Bank. The People’s Bank of China has raised interest rates five times and increased the reserve requirement nine times in the past 12 months, slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy behind the U.S. To contact the reporter on this story: Scott Lanman in Washington at  slanman@bloomberg.net ; Simon Kennedy in London at  skennedy4@bloomberg.net.

The Central Bank of Kenya raised its benchmark interest rate this week by four percentage points to 11 percent. Other emerging market central banks have room to join developed economies in providing stimulus if growth falters, said Lyons at Standard Chartered Bank. The People’s Bank of China has raised interest rates five times and increased the reserve requirement nine times in the past 12 months, slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy behind the U.S. To contact the reporter on this story: Scott Lanman in Washington at  slanman@bloomberg.net ; Simon Kennedy in London at  skennedy4@bloomberg.net.

Californians May Lose Federal Jobless Aid as Rate Falls,['Mark Melnicoe'],2013-07-19 00:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/californians-may-lose-federal-jobless-aid-as-rate-falls.html,"California ’s jobless rate declined to a four-year low of 8.5 percent last month, triggering an end to benefits for more than 100,000 people still out of work, according to the state employment agency. Under U.S. Labor Department rules, residents are no longer eligible for the final 10 weeks of extended federal unemployment benefits known as tier 4, because the state jobless rate has fallen below a moving three-month average of 9 percent, the California Employment Development Department said yesterday. California, among the hardest-hit states in the 18-month recession that ended in June 2009, has crawled its way back and seen its jobless rate fall from a record 12.4 percent in October 2010. A year ago, the state remained mired in a slump and matched Rhode Island for the nation’s second-highest jobless rate, trailing only Nevada. With the June figures, the Golden State inched closer to the U.S. 7.6 percent average. The state labor agency warned that it expects to be notified today that more than 100,000 Californians currently receiving extended benefits will face a cutoff, unless they can qualify for the final 10 weeks of aid before Aug. 11. More unemployed workers may also be affected later, the agency said. Those who are already collecting and remain eligible can receive aid until Dec. 28 or until it runs out, whichever comes first, the agency said. Biggest Gains California posted the largest nonfarm payroll gain of any state, adding 30,200 jobs last month, Labor Department figures show. The state’s jobless rate fell from 8.6 percent in May and 9 percent in April. Led by a revival of the housing market and construction, California has added more than 250,000 such jobs in the past year to reach about 14.6 million, the agency said. The state said more aid cutbacks are on the horizon. All extensions to the basic 26 weeks of state unemployment benefits are set to run out at the end of this year unless Congress votes to renew them. Basic benefits plus all state and federal extensions have let jobless workers receive aid for as long as 99 weeks during the recession and its aftermath. Benefits were trimmed earlier this year, when Congress allowed automatic spending cuts to kick in under a process known as budget sequestration. More than 750,000 Californians are collecting unemployment checks, with almost half on federal extensions, the state agency said. The agency paid out $13.8 billion in benefits last year and $5.8 billion in 2013 through June.

Vermont Insurance-Exchange Rates Show Savings From Health Law,['Alex Wayne'],2013-04-02 04:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/vermont-s-first-look-at-insurance-exchange-rates-shows-savings.html,"Vermont residents may save money on medical insurance through subsidized exchange plans under President Barack Obama ’s Affordable Care Act, according to the first state look at premiums under the 2010 health law. The Vermont rates provide an initial analysis of how much health insurance may cost Americans nationwide as the law’s core provision kicks in next year. In Vermont, a couple earning $32,000 a year would pay about $134 a month after U.S. subsidies for a certain level of coverage that would have cost them $248 under the state’s existing program, according to a comparison document published by the state. The state has built the insurance exchange for people who don’t get coverage at their jobs. Federal and state subsidies are a key part of keeping the new health plans affordable, said Robin Wood, a spokeswoman for MVP Health Care, a nonprofit insurer that serves Vermont, in an e-mail. Basic premiums in the exchange, called Vermont Health Connect, would be “roughly comparable to what people currently pay, but for better coverage,” Governor Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, said in a statement. Insurers including Aetna Inc., based in Hartford, Connecticut , have warned of “rate shock” when customers shop for plans in exchanges, citing health-law policies that mandate better benefits and prohibit the companies from refusing to cover the sick or charging older people more than three times as much as young adults. Vermont’s insurance exchange will be served by two companies, MVP Health, based in Schenectady, New York , and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont. Catastrophic Plan Without the subsidies, premiums would start at $202 a month for a single person under 30 buying a stripped-down “catastrophic” plan sold by MVP Health, according to the statement released yesterday by Vermont. “Platinum” coverage for an entire family, the most expensive available, would cost $1,728 a month from MVP or $1,698 from Blue Cross Blue Shield. The proposed rates from the two insurers must be reviewed by state regulators before becoming final in July. The exchanges are set to open for shopping Oct. 1 for health plans that would take effect Jan. 1. Vermont also intends to be the first state in the U.S. with a single-payer health-care system, in which the government pays all of its residents’ medical bills and insurance companies are unnecessary. The state legislature passed a law in 2011 to steer the state toward adopting such a system in 2017, the soonest possible under the federal health-care law.

The worst drought in more than 50 years scorched U.S. corn, soybean and wheat crops in July and August, cutting production. As stockpiles were drawn down to meet demand for grains and oilseeds, the value of farm inventories fell $20 billion last quarter following an $8 billion drop the prior three months, LaVorgna said in a note. “If the U.S. were growing at 4 percent, it wouldn’t be as big an issue, but at 2 percent ,it’s noticed,” LaVorgna said in a telephone interview from New York. Gross domestic product this year will be reduced by 0.5 percentage point to 1 percentage point because of inventory losses, he said. The U.S. will grow by 2.1 percent in 2012, according to the median of 89 estimates in Bloomberg survey of economists. The drop in farm inventories subtracted 0.4 percentage point from third-quarter GDP, the value of all goods and services produced, after cutting 0.2 point in the prior three months, Commerce Department data show. Deutsche Bank’s 2012 forecast for U.S. GDP was 2.1 percent as of Oct. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Farmers may start to replenish inventories as crops rebound, LaVorgna said. “We may get a bit of a bounce this quarter or in the first half of next year, assuming normal weather,” LaVorgna said.

When the Depression Incited an Oil Crisis,['Philip Scranton'],2012-12-03 21:28:26,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-03/when-the-depression-incited-an-oil-crisis.html,"In late November 1932, Reza Shah Pahlavi, who had seized control of the Persian government in 1925, canceled a petroleum deal that the U.K.'s Anglo-Persian Oil had held for three decades. Persia, now known as Iran , believed that its royalties since World War I had been two-thirds lower than what they should have been, and it wanted a new deal. The shah’s foreign minister had negotiated with the British for years to rework a 1913 contract that awarded the government 16 percent of Anglo-Persian Oil’s declared net profits, a revenue stream that collapsed during the Great Depression. Worse, Persian administrators suspected that Anglo-Persian Oil reduced profits by paying subsidiaries generous fees for transportation and maintenance. For shipments of more than 40 million barrels of oil in 1931, the Persian government had received about $1.5 million. It now sought 25 percent ownership of the corporation, a comparable share of its profits and about 50 cents for each ton of crude oil drawn from wells (about $12 million annually). When the British stalled, the shah granted an auto import monopoly to General Motors and another to Firestone for tires. Worried that an American oil company could be waiting offstage to complete this trifecta by replacing Anglo-Persian Oil, the U.K. rejected any Persian right to annul the contract. The British Foreign Office raised the idea that the Soviets were behind the action. The USSR had “offered every possible inducement to the Persian authorities to terminate the agreement and to secure the oil wells for themselves,” the Daily Express reported. The U.K. government commenced planning for military intervention, while Anglo-Persian Oil’s chairman left New York for London to take the crisis in hand. Six new gunboats Persia had purchased from Italian leader Benito Mussolini’s shipyards were now patrolling the Persian Gulf, manned by Italians. W.E. Beckett, a Foreign Office lawyer, worked to prevent military action. His crucial Dec. 5 report argued that employing force “would be taking a line in Persia very similar to that assumed by Japan in Manchuria.” It would be far better to refer the dispute to the League of Nations than to join Japan and Italy in the ranks of aggressor nations. Beckett won the policy debate. Britain “by a single stroke has tried to put a sordid quarrel onto a higher plane,” the New York Times reported. Persia contained “all the diplomatic dynamite which exploded in Manchuria a year ago. The spoils are pipelines in Persia and railroads in Manchuria. Though they are 6,000 miles apart, these two danger spots in Asia have been created by similar conditions” -- economic stresses intensified by the Depression.

Xstrata Plc and Glencore International Plc (GLEN) fell as the companies requested a one-week extension for directors to decide on the commodity trader’s $35 billion takeover offer. Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) and Evraz Plc (EVR) paced advancing shares as metal prices climbed. Pearson Plc rose the most in five months after Exane BNP Paribas upgraded the publisher. The FTSE 100 slipped 2.02 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 5,852.62 at the close of trading in London. The gauge erased an earlier advance of as much as 0.6 percent as options on the index expired in a process known as witching. The broader FTSE All-Share Index was also little changed, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index climbed 0.6 percent. “Options expiry day has produced a burst of volatility,” said David Jones , chief market strategist at IG in London. “This is a small hiccup when compared to the general strength we have seen in equities markets of late.” The FTSE 100 climbed to the highest level since March on Sept. 14 after unprecedented economic stimulus from the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve boosted investor confidence. The gauge has slipped 1.1 percent this week as data on Chinese factory output, U.S. jobless claims and euro-area services and manufacturing heightened concern about the strength of the global economy. ‘Remain Bullish’ “We remain bullish on European equities into the year end,” Graham Bishop, an equity strategist at Exane in London, wrote in a report today. “Valuations remain attractive, policy easing should underpin growth and participation should rise as investors move on from the ‘wait-and-see’ approach.” Stocks climbed earlier today after the Financial Times reported that Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos is in talks with European Commission authorities to facilitate a new bailout program that will be presented Sept. 27. The plan is said to focus on structural measures sought by the European Union, not new taxes or spending cuts, according to the newspaper which cited unidentified officials involved in the discussions.

The companies were granted a one-week extension from the U.K. takeover panel to rally support for Glencore’s takeover offer. Xstrata said it made the request to enable directors to take account of feedback from key shareholders. The largest exporter of thermal coal is now due to respond to Glencore’s revised all-share proposal by 7 a.m. London time on Oct. 1. “They are clearly struggling,” Charles Newsome, investment director at Investec Plc, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “It’s a difficult deal for them to pull off because of the way it is structured. I’ve been quite uncomfortable with this all the way along.” National Grid Plc (NG/) fell 1.1 percent to 686.5 pence as JPMorgan Chase & Co. lowered its recommendation for the utility to underweight from neutral, citing regulatory hurdles in the next six months.

Bra-Bodysuits Make H&M One Hit Wonder as Zara Prospers,['Julie Cruz'],2012-11-15 07:44:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/bra-bodysuits-make-h-m-one-hit-wonder-as-zara-prospers.html,"(Corrects company name in first paragraph in story published Nov. 13) Hennes & Mauritz (HMB) AB is counting on a designer collection that includes a bodysuit with the image of a black bra printed across the chest to attract attention this holiday season. The rest of the Swedish retailer’s business is failing to do the same. H&M on Nov. 15 starts selling a Maison Martin Margiela collection of about 100 items such as the $40 bodysuit, a $349 duvet coat, and oversized trousers for $129. While temporary offerings from top designers have figured in the company’s strategy since a 2004 Karl Lagerfeld line led to mobbed stores, for most of the year H&M struggles to remain as relevant as rival Inditex SA (ITX) , the owner of Zara. “I am always on the lookout for unique pieces that are really well-made, but there will only be one or two that I’m attracted to at H&M each season,” said Amaya Wilhelm, 28, co- founder of fashion blog pramache.com. “I find many more exciting, unique pieces at Zara.” Despite the swell of enthusiasm and interest that accompanies the temporary collections, H&M has fallen behind Inditex in the race for the price-sensitive fashionista’s euro because most of its clothing takes months to get from design board to shop, said Daniel Lucht from consulting firm ResearchFarm in London. Inditex designers seek inspiration from what customers are wearing and asking for, and get it to stores in weeks, Lucht said. That means Zara shoppers seeking the next new thing don’t have to wait for the special collections that typically come once or twice a year for H&M to boost its fashion bona fides. ’More Elegant’ “In terms of quality, H&M and Inditex are very similar so it all comes down to fashionability, style and design,” Lucht said. “Zara designs are a bit more elegant, a bit more out there.” For investors, Inditex shares look better, too. The Spanish company’s stock is up 57 percent this year while H&M’s is down 1.6 percent. Inditex overtook H&M as Europe ’s biggest clothing maker in 2006 and this year became Spain’s most valuable company. Its market capitalization now exceeds that of H&M and U.S. rival Gap Inc. (GPS) combined. H&M shares dropped 1.5 percent to 217.70 kronor as of 12:18 p.m. in Stockholm trading today, while Inditex added 0.4 percent to 99.06 euros in Madrid. H&M uses the temporary collections to drive publicity as well as sales. With Maison Martin Margiela -- available at about 10 percent of its 2,600-plus stores worldwide -- H&M is selling items like a $199 dress that appears to be worn horizontally rather than vertically and $299 wedge shoes with a clear heel so the wearer seems to float above the ground. “There’s a lot of humor in Margiela’s design,” said Margareta van den Bosch, a creative adviser at H&M. The couturier “transforms garments and you wear them in a different way.” ’Huge Interest’ H&M last year teamed up with Versace in a collection it said garnered “huge interest” and has worked with Madonna and Jimmy Choo previously. “It’s great when designers like Anna Dello Russo or Versace come in and do a line as it is more fun and wearable than high-end fashion,” said Gemma Carmichael, 23, who works as an assistant to fashion stylists in London. Though the special collections don’t have a big impact on overall sales, they help infuse the company’s regular lineup with a greater sense of style and give H&M more credibility in the fashion world, said Manfred Abraham, head of consulting at London-based Interbrand. Other Stories “They are learning from the designers they are working with and they are incorporating that into their collections,” Abraham said. “H&M is taking a more extreme step into fashion.” Consumers who buy Margiela’s creations, though, may not return to snap up H&M staples such as $10 leggings and $8 T- shirts, so the collections offer diminishing returns for the company, said Chris Nurko, the chairman of branding consultancy FutureBrand. “Designer exclusives can be very limiting,” he said. “It is not a long-term viable solution for the master brand H&M.” H&M, which opened its first store in Sweden in 1947, has been slower to diversify than Inditex. Brands other than Zara account for 62 percent of the Spanish company’s outlets and 35 percent of revenue. At H&M, by contrast, the four non-flagship brands -- COS, Monki, Weekday and Cheap Monday -- represent roughly 5 percent of total stores. Next spring, H&M will add a sixth brand, & Other Stories, with about 10 outlets across Europe selling pricier clothing, lingerie and accessories. H&M must “take advantage of the relationship they have built with teenagers and exploit it when those teenagers grow up,” said Armando Branchini , founder of Milan-based consultancy Intercorporate. “Zara has an assortment that can be suitable for teenagers but also for their parents.” To contact the reporter on this story: Julie Cruz in Frankfurt at jcruz6@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Celeste Perri at cperri@bloomberg.net",['Julie Cruz'],"Bra-Bodysuits Make H&M One Hit Wonder as Zara Prospers (Corrects company name in first paragraph in story published Nov. 13) Hennes & Mauritz (HMB) AB is counting on a designer collection that includes a bodysuit with the image of a black bra printed across the chest to attract attention this holiday season.

Ex-N.Y. Hospital CEO Charged With Taking Vendor Kickbacks,['Bob Van Voris'],2012-09-26 21:03:16,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/ex-n-y-hospital-ceo-charged-with-taking-vendor-kickbacks.html,"John R. Reynolds, former chief executive officer of New York ’s Hospital for Special Surgery, was charged by federal prosecutors with taking $1.4 million in a decade-long illegal-kickback scheme. Reynolds, 63, was arrested at his home in Massachusetts this morning, according to a statement from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. An indictment unsealed today in Manhattan federal court charges Reynolds with racketeering and making false statements to the government. He faces as long as 25 years in prison if convicted. Prosecutors claim that, from 1996 to 2007, Reynolds took money from at least two hospital vendors, a hospital employee and an unidentified health-care organization in the U.K. The orthopedic hospital is known for treating sports stars including New York Mets third baseman David Wright and New York Yankee relief pitcher Mariano Rivera. Reynolds left the hospital in 2008, according to the indictment. “The government’s allegations are without basis in fact or law,” Reynolds’s lawyer, Michael Grudberg, said in an e-mailed statement today. “Mr. Reynolds served HSS faithfully and diligently for two decades and looks forward to making his case in court.” Reynolds appeared today in federal court in Boston and was released on $100,000 bond, Grudberg said. Sports Medicine The Hospital for Special Surgery was founded in 1863 as the Hospital for the Relief of the Ruptured and Crippled, according to its website. In addition to the Mets and Yankees, players for teams including the New York Giants , New York Knicks , New York Red Bulls, USA Swimming and St. John’s University are treated by doctors at the hospital, according to the site. “Obviously, it was a shock to us,” said Deborah Sale, a hospital spokeswoman, referring to the charges. Sale said the hospital cooperated with Bharara’s investigation. Reynolds served as the hospital’s chief financial officer from 1986 to 1997, when he was promoted to chief executive officer, according to the indictment. He was replaced as CEO and continued as a contract worker from October 2006 until December 2008, according to prosecutors. The government claims Reynolds took a total of $420,000 in kickbacks from at least two hospital vendors, from 1996 to 2002, in exchange for steering hospital business to them. From 2000 to 2005, he extorted an additional $298,500 from a subordinate at the hospital after negotiating an annual bonus for the employee, according to the charges. Reynolds also received $670,000 for approving a clinical partnership between his hospital and the U.K. health-care organization, prosecutors claim.

Hospital CEO Charged With Taking Vendor Kickbacks John R. Reynolds, former chief executive officer of New York ’s Hospital for Special Surgery, was charged by federal prosecutors with taking $1.4 million in a decade-long illegal-kickback scheme. Reynolds, 63, was arrested at his home in Massachusetts this morning, according to a statement from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. An indictment unsealed today in Manhattan federal court charges Reynolds with racketeering and making false statements to the government. He faces as long as 25 years in prison if convicted. Prosecutors claim that, from 1996 to 2007, Reynolds took money from at least two hospital vendors, a hospital employee and an unidentified health-care organization in the U.K. The orthopedic hospital is known for treating sports stars including New York Mets third baseman David Wright and New York Yankee relief pitcher Mariano Rivera. Reynolds left the hospital in 2008, according to the indictment. “The government’s allegations are without basis in fact or law,” Reynolds’s lawyer, Michael Grudberg, said in an e-mailed statement today. “Mr. Reynolds served HSS faithfully and diligently for two decades and looks forward to making his case in court.” Reynolds appeared today in federal court in Boston and was released on $100,000 bond, Grudberg said. Sports Medicine The Hospital for Special Surgery was founded in 1863 as the Hospital for the Relief of the Ruptured and Crippled, according to its website. In addition to the Mets and Yankees, players for teams including the New York Giants , New York Knicks , New York Red Bulls, USA Swimming and St. John’s University are treated by doctors at the hospital, according to the site. “Obviously, it was a shock to us,” said Deborah Sale, a hospital spokeswoman, referring to the charges. Sale said the hospital cooperated with Bharara’s investigation. Reynolds served as the hospital’s chief financial officer from 1986 to 1997, when he was promoted to chief executive officer, according to the indictment. He was replaced as CEO and continued as a contract worker from October 2006 until December 2008, according to prosecutors. The government claims Reynolds took a total of $420,000 in kickbacks from at least two hospital vendors, from 1996 to 2002, in exchange for steering hospital business to them. From 2000 to 2005, he extorted an additional $298,500 from a subordinate at the hospital after negotiating an annual bonus for the employee, according to the charges. Reynolds also received $670,000 for approving a clinical partnership between his hospital and the U.K. health-care organization, prosecutors claim. Inspector General Reynolds is also charged with lying in 2008 to an agent of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services inspector general’s office. “By allegedly exploiting his position at the helm of a world renowned hospital for his own personal gain, John Reynolds tarnished the hospital’s reputation and did a disservice to its employees,” Bharara said in the statement.

Baum’s Foreclosure Law Firm Agrees to Pay U.S. $2 Million Over Practices,['Thom Weidlich'],2011-10-06 21:24:10,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/baum-law-firm-to-pay-2-million-over-foreclosure-practices-in-new-york.html,"Steven J. Baum’s foreclosure law firm , one of the largest in New York state, will pay the U.S. $2 million and change its practices, including those related to Merscorp Inc.’s mortgage database, to resolve a probe of its foreclosure filings. The agreement, signed today, resolves an investigation into whether the Baum firm filed misleading pleadings, affidavits and mortgage assignments in courts, according to a statement by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan. The settlement doesn’t constitute a finding of wrongdoing. “There are no excuses for sloppy practices that could lead to someone mistakenly losing their home,” Bharara said in the statement. “Homeowners facing foreclosure cannot afford to have faulty paperwork or inadequate evidence submitted, and today’s agreement will help minimize that risk.” Steven J. Baum PC, located in Amherst, New York, just north of Buffalo, has attracted lawsuits and fines for its actions during the housing crisis. It has been accused of overcharging, filing false documents and representing parties on both sides of a mortgage transfer. State attorneys general and federal regulators are negotiating with banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) to try to reach a settlement over faulty foreclosure practices in the wake of the financial crisis. The changes in procedure “go over and above what current law requires,” Baum said in an e-mailed statement. “We will continue to adhere to the highest ethical standards.” Shares Address Pillar Processing LLC, which processes foreclosure documents and shares an address with the law firm, is also part of the settlement. Pillar is owned by Manhattan private-equity firm Tailwind Capital LLC, according to its website. Brooke Gordon, spokeswoman for Tailwind Capital, declined to comment on the settlement. Baum acknowledged that the firm “occasionally made inadvertent errors in its legal filings in state and federal court, which it attributes to human error in light of the high volume of mortgage defaults and foreclosures,” according to Bharara’s statement. The agreement calls for the firm’s employees to halt their practice of assigning mortgages as supposed employees of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems Inc., an electronic database of mortgages. ‘No Connection’ “Until recently, employees of Baum, with the consent of MERS, had been assigning mortgages on behalf of MERS, even though they had no connection to MERS whatsoever,” according to Bharara’s statement. MERS, a unit of Reston, Virginia-based Merscorp Inc., was set up by the mortgage industry to allow banks to assign and reassign home loans without having to record the changes with county land-records offices. Janis Smith, a MERS spokeswoman, didn’t have an immediate comment on the MERS allegation. The agreement calls for the Baum firm to obtain affidavits from clients attesting that they have the original promissory notes or have searched for them, to have experienced attorneys supervise the preparation of documents and to implement a training program for its attorneys. MERS Assignments “Borrowers and some courts have been questioning the validity of MERS assignments, pleadings and affidavits from the Baum firm for several years,” Jennifer Sinton, deputy director of the foreclosure-prevention project at South Brooklyn Legal Services, said in an interview. “It’s good to see that Baum is now required to discontinue these practices. Hopefully, this will protect courts and homeowners from bogus foreclosure lawsuits.” New York State Supreme Court Justice Arthur M. Schack in Brooklyn called the Baum firm’s explanations in one case “so incredible, outrageous, ludicrous and disingenuous that they should have been authored by the late Rod Serling.” Schack threw out the case in part because he said the assignment of the loan by a Baum lawyer on behalf of MERS as nominee of the lender had been done improperly. The same day, the Baum firm represented the buyer of the loan by filing the foreclosure action, the judge said. Schack said it was a conflict for the firm to represent both sides. “Steven J. Baum PC appears to be operating in a parallel mortgage universe, unrelated to the real universe,” the judge wrote in that May 2010 decision. “Next stop, the Twilight Zone,” he said, quoting from Serling’s TV series about science fiction and the supernatural. Baum said last year that in several cases where Schack stated the firm represented both sides in a mortgage transfer, “we have supplied to the court relevant documentation indicating that no conflict of interest existed.” To contact the reporter on this story: Thom Weidlich in Brooklyn , New York, federal court at  tweidlich@bloomberg.net.

Oracle Embraces Cloud to Fuel Growth Without Acquisitions,['Aaron Ricadela'],2011-10-07 20:20:10,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/oracle-top-executives-say-big-deals-may-distract-face-hurdles.html,"Oracle Corp. (ORCL) , the world’s second- largest software maker, aims to eschew big acquisitions and promote growth from within, relying on hardware sales and a new cloud-computing service to broaden use of its products. After gobbling up more than 70 companies in a $40 billion buying spree, any additional large deals would have to clear an “enormous hurdle,” Oracle co-President Safra Catz said yesterday at a meeting with analysts in San Francisco. The company instead will focus on what it already has, including the Sun Microsystems server business it purchased last year for $7.4 billion. Oracle is packaging its database and business applications into customized computers to entice customers. The company also is touting its new Fusion business applications and a service called the Oracle Public Cloud, which delivers software online via cloud computing. “People realize M&A is a big part of the Oracle growth story -- on the other hand, no one wants to see a big, dilutive acquisition,” said Bill Whyman, an analyst who covers the technology industry at ISI Group Inc. Large deals would create distractions for management, Oracle co-President Mark Hurd said at yesterday’s event. The company will focus on “organic” growth from existing products during the current fiscal year, he said. ‘Strong Year’ “We think we’re going to have a really strong year,” said Hurd, who joined Oracle in 2010 after serving as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) ’s chief executive officer. Oracle, based in Redwood City , California , embarked on its run of acquisitions in 2005 when it bought the human-resources software maker PeopleSoft Inc. The company has relied on deals to boost sales to $35.6 billion in the fiscal year ended in May. This year, revenue is projected to rise 8 percent to $38.6 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company combined the features it acquired from PeopleSoft, J.D. Edwards and Siebel Systems into the Fusion apps, which Oracle made available this week at its OpenWorld conference, following six years of development. Fusion software handles business tasks such as sales, human resources, finance and inventory management. Customers will be able to run the more than 100 Fusion applications on their own computers or in Oracle’s data centers, through the Oracle Public Cloud. The cloud service will be available within weeks, the company said. Social Network  Users can navigate the Fusion programs through the Oracle Social Network, which spotlights tasks that need completing and lets people share documents, CEO Larry Ellison said earlier this week during a demonstration of the software. The approach mimics some of the features of Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) ’s Chatter, a social- networking service for businesses. A feud between Oracle and Salesforce escalated this week after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff was scrubbed from a scheduled appearance at the OpenWorld show. Benioff said it was because he criticized Ellison for selling expensive computers instead of just promoting online services. “I pissed Larry off so badly that he canceled my keynote,” Benioff said at a press conference this week. Oracle, which ranks second to Microsoft Corp. in worldwide software sales, has seen its stock climb 9 percent over the past 12 months. The shares fell 10 cents to $29.91 today on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Oracle also is introducing new hardware that it developed with Sun technology. Earlier this week, the company unveiled two computer systems, one with faster data-analysis capabilities and another for organizing information from the Web, as it aims to win market share from Hewlett-Packard, International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and SAP AG. (SAP)  ‘No Confusion’ Shifting into the cloud helps Oracle keep pace with those rivals, which are delivering more software via the Internet.

Barclays Saudi Probe Adds to CEO Jenkins’s Regulatory Woe,['Howard Mustoe'],2012-11-12 09:18:13,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/barclays-saudi-investigation-adds-to-jenkins-s-regulatory-woes.html,"Barclays Plc (BARC) Chief Executive Officer Antony Jenkins , almost two years after his predecessor said it was time for banks to stop apologizing, is still grappling with a multiplying number of probes by regulators. The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether the lender made payments that violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to win a banking license for its wealth-management unit and investment bank in Saudi Arabia, the Financial Times reported on Nov. 9, citing unidentified people familiar with the talks. The bank is already being probed by the Serious Fraud Office over fees it paid in 2009 to Qatar’s sovereign-wealth fund as the lender sought money to avoid a government bailout. For Jenkins, who replaced Robert Diamond after the lender paid a record fine for manipulating Libor, the probes are likely to be a bigger setback to his efforts to show politicians the bank can put regulatory missteps behind it than the size of any fines, according to analysts. He may have to include stiffer internal controls to detect staff who break laws in pursuit of revenue when he announces the results of his review of Barclays’s operations in February, said Christopher Wheeler, a London-based banking analyst at Mediobanca SpA. “Jenkins has to continue to batten down the hatches, say these issues came out of the pre-crisis period and say he can create an atmosphere where it doesn’t happen again,” said Wheeler, who rates the shares an outperform. “The more that comes out, the more he can wave the big stick in February.” British Lawmakers In January 2011, Diamond told a panel of British lawmakers that the time for “remorse and apology” for banks needed to be over. Since then, the lender has paid a record 290 million-pound ($461 million) fine after regulators found its investment bankers tried to manipulate the London interbank offered rate. The consumer bank, which Jenkins, 51, previously ran, has also been hobbled by compensation claims from Britons wrongly sold so-called payment-protection insurance they didn’t require or lost them money. The lender last month set aside an additional 700 million pounds to cover the costs of redress, bringing the total to 2 billion pounds, second only to Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , the country’s biggest mortgage lender. U.S. regulators this month also proposed levying a record $470 million in penalties on Barclays after it allegedly gamed energy markets in the Western U.S. from late 2006 to 2008. John McGuinness, a Barclays spokesman, and the Department of Justice’s Rebekah Carmichael declined to comment on the Saudi probe. The Saudi Arabian capital markets regulator, known as the CMA, said it is “not aware of any investigation” into Barclays and hasn’t received any inquiries from regulators on the matter. Shares Fall The stock fell as much as 1.1 percent to 227.55 pence in London and was down 0.6 percent to 228.85 pence at 8:59 a.m. local time, giving the lender a market value of 28 billion pounds. The shares have advanced 30 percent this year, the third-biggest increase among British banks after Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. (RBS)  Barclays, Britain’s second-largest bank by assets, received a license from Saudi Arabia’s market authority to operate in the kingdom in August 2009. The London-based lender sought to expand its wealth-management operation in the region as the country’s oil wealth created more millionaires. The lender said in an Oct. 31 filing that the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission were probing whether its relationships with unidentified third parties who help the bank win business comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. U.S. Probe Estimating the size of any fine U.S. authorities may impose is difficult without knowing more about the nature of the Justice Department’s investigation, said Cormac Leech, a banking analyst at Liberum Capital in London. “Manipulating the energy or Libor markets is more significant because of its scale, so I would think any penalty would be less,” he said by telephone yesterday. The bank’s wealth-management business contributed 6.1 percent of Barclays’s 33 billion pounds of revenue in 2011. The company doesn’t disclose how much the Saudi Arabian operation contributes. “Because the business is relatively small, I don’t think you’re talking about hundreds of millions of pounds” in fines, Mediobanca’s Wheeler said. The Saudi probe follows a U.K. inquiry by the Serious Fraud Office into fees the bank paid in 2008 to Qatar’s sovereign- wealth fund as the lender sought money to avoid a government bailout. The company has said it’s investigating and is co- operating with U.S. Authorities. The SFO has given Barclays a notice that requires it to hand over documents and witnesses, the FT reported. SFO spokesman David Jones declined to comment. ‘More Unsavory’ Allegations of improper payments could still drag more senior executives into the bank’s crisis than the traders implicated in the Libor scandal, said Ismail Erturk, a senior lecturer in banking at Manchester Business School. “This shows the problems are more than just about investment-banking culture,” he said by telephone. “It shows we need a much broader investigation into banking. This is a new category of wrongdoing by banks.

The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether the lender made payments that violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to win a banking license for its wealth-management unit and investment bank in Saudi Arabia, the Financial Times reported on Nov. 9, citing unidentified people familiar with the talks. The bank is already being probed by the Serious Fraud Office over fees it paid in 2009 to Qatar’s sovereign-wealth fund as the lender sought money to avoid a government bailout. For Jenkins, who replaced Robert Diamond after the lender paid a record fine for manipulating Libor, the probes are likely to be a bigger setback to his efforts to show politicians the bank can put regulatory missteps behind it than the size of any fines, according to analysts. He may have to include stiffer internal controls to detect staff who break laws in pursuit of revenue when he announces the results of his review of Barclays’s operations in February, said Christopher Wheeler, a London-based banking analyst at Mediobanca SpA. “Jenkins has to continue to batten down the hatches, say these issues came out of the pre-crisis period and say he can create an atmosphere where it doesn’t happen again,” said Wheeler, who rates the shares an outperform. “The more that comes out, the more he can wave the big stick in February.” British Lawmakers In January 2011, Diamond told a panel of British lawmakers that the time for “remorse and apology” for banks needed to be over. Since then, the lender has paid a record 290 million-pound ($461 million) fine after regulators found its investment bankers tried to manipulate the London interbank offered rate. The consumer bank, which Jenkins, 51, previously ran, has also been hobbled by compensation claims from Britons wrongly sold so-called payment-protection insurance they didn’t require or lost them money. The lender last month set aside an additional 700 million pounds to cover the costs of redress, bringing the total to 2 billion pounds, second only to Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , the country’s biggest mortgage lender. U.S. regulators this month also proposed levying a record $470 million in penalties on Barclays after it allegedly gamed energy markets in the Western U.S. from late 2006 to 2008. John McGuinness, a Barclays spokesman, and the Department of Justice’s Rebekah Carmichael declined to comment on the Saudi probe. The Saudi Arabian capital markets regulator, known as the CMA, said it is “not aware of any investigation” into Barclays and hasn’t received any inquiries from regulators on the matter. Shares Fall The stock fell as much as 1.1 percent to 227.55 pence in London and was down 0.6 percent to 228.85 pence at 8:59 a.m. local time, giving the lender a market value of 28 billion pounds. The shares have advanced 30 percent this year, the third-biggest increase among British banks after Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. (RBS)  Barclays, Britain’s second-largest bank by assets, received a license from Saudi Arabia’s market authority to operate in the kingdom in August 2009. The London-based lender sought to expand its wealth-management operation in the region as the country’s oil wealth created more millionaires. The lender said in an Oct. 31 filing that the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission were probing whether its relationships with unidentified third parties who help the bank win business comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

Saks rose as much as 19 percent yesterday after the New York Post reported that Starwood Capital has offered between $17 and $18 a share for the chain, equal to an offer from Hudson’s Bay Co.

BP Seeks to Halt Some Gulf Oil-Spill Settlement Payments,['Jef Feeley'],2013-04-02 00:01:03,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/bp-seeks-to-halt-some-gulf-oil-spill-settlement-payments.html,"BP Plc (BP/) ’s lawsuit challenging some payments under the $8.5 billion Gulf of Mexico oil-spill settlement should be thrown out because the company is seeking to change fixed terms in the agreement, spill victims said. BP’s suit targeting interpretations of the settlement by court-appointed administrator Patrick Juneau is flawed and should be dismissed, lawyers for oil spill victims who agreed to resolve their claims said in a filing today in federal court in New Orleans. “BP has not set forth facts that give rise to a viable claim” over Juneau’s interpretation of provisions about economic-loss claims, the attorneys said in court papers. The filing comes as BP is set to start its sixth week of trial tomorrow over claims that the London-based oil company was grossly negligent in its handling of the Macondo well and was responsible for the fatal explosion and spill that fouled the gulf in 2010. Ellen Moskowitz , an outside BP spokeswoman, had no immediate comment on the filing by the spill victims. Moskowitz is a partner with the New York-based Brunswick Group. U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans, who is presiding over the nonjury trial of liability for the worst offshore spill in U.S. history, previously declined to force Juneau to alter his interpretation of the settlement terms to match BP’s expectations. ‘Fictitious Losses’ BP contends in court papers that Juneau’s interpretation of the settlement accord includes claims the oil company “never contemplated” paying. The firm’s lawyers also argue the administrator is exposing BP to millions of dollars in “fictitious losses” as a result of Juneau’s reading of the pact. BP said two-thirds of all business economic-loss payments larger than $75,000 have been based on “flawed data.” The company also contends that more than 1,200 payments have been made to claimants in the agriculture, construction and professional services industries that are too remote from the area impacted by the spill to qualify for compensation. In today’s filing, lawyers for spill victims said Juneau has no power to revise his interpretation of the settlement to conform with BP’s view given Barbier’s approval of the accord last year. The administrator had no authority “to adopt BP’s proposed framework for calculating variable profit, regardless of whether it would be a reasonable approach, because it would be inconsistent with the court’s interpretation of the language of the settlement agreement,” the lawyers said. Uncapped Accord The uncapped accord resolved most private plaintiffs’ claims for economic loss and property damage related to the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig in April 2010 and the ensuing spill. The accord excludes claims of financial institutions, casinos, private plaintiffs in parts of Florida and Texas , and residents and businesses claiming harm from the Obama administration’s moratorium on deep-water drilling prompted by the spill. It also doesn’t cover federal government claims and those of Gulf Coast states Louisiana and Alabama , or lawsuits against co-defendants.

Asia Seen Nearing End of Slowdown on China Recovery: Economy,['Karl Lester M.Yap' 'Michael J.Munoz'],2012-11-15 06:36:17,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/asia-seen-nearing-end-of-slowdown-on-china-recovery-economy.html,"East Asian countries are poised to report gross domestic product data that may mark the bottom of the region’s slowdown, as signs of a recovery in China and the U.S. herald a revival in demand for exports. Hong Kong ’s GDP probably rose last quarter after declining the previous three months, according to a Bloomberg survey before a report tomorrow. Expansion in Malaysia and Thailand may have eased while Singapore ’s contraction was probably worse than initially estimated, separate surveys showed. Regional growth will probably recover this quarter, Moody’s Analytics, Citigroup Inc., and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group predict. “Across Asia , the business cycle likely reached its trough, with many economies reporting the worst growth in the third quarter,” said Glenn Levine, an economist at Moody’s Analytics in Sydney. “Stimulus measures are starting to boost Chinese demand and the recovery slowly coming into fruition in the U.S. means 2013 will be a better year for most of the region.” Most Asian currencies, led by the South Korean won and Taiwanese dollar, have risen in the past three months as stronger housing demand in the U.S. and accelerating factory output in China signal the two largest economies may lift the world from its mid-year slowdown. While interest-rate cuts in Thailand and the Philippines in October underscored the immediate risks to growth, pressure to loosen monetary policy further has abated elsewhere, with Singapore and Indonesia refraining from stimulus in their most recent decisions. “The region is unlikely to go for further easing at this point in time,” said Aninda Mitra , a Singapore-based economist at ANZ. “Countries are starting to face asset price and inflation pressures and they’ll have to be careful about that.” Rising Confidence China’s factory output and retail sales exceeded forecasts in October and exports climbed the most since May. U.S. consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, and an improving housing market are leading the expansion amid rising confidence, better employment prospects and healthier household finances. Hong Kong’s gross domestic product probably expanded 0.5 percent in the three months through September from the previous quarter, according to the median of 11 economists in a survey. Malaysia’s year-on-year economic growth eased to 4.8 percent in the third quarter from 5.4 percent, according to the median of 22 economists surveyed before a report due tomorrow. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is increasing spending ahead of a general election that must be held by early 2013. Najib announced lower income taxes and more handouts for the poor in his 2013 budget unveiled in September, as the government projected Southeast Asia ’s third-largest economy will expand as much as 5 percent in 2012. Tentative Signs In Thailand , Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has also boosted spending and raised salaries as the nation recovers from the worst floods in almost 70 years. Gross domestic product probably rose 3 percent last quarter from a year earlier, slowing from a 4.2 percent gain in the previous three months, according to a Bloomberg survey before a report due Nov 19. Meanwhile, Singapore’s economy probably shrank 2.9 percent in the third quarter from the previous three months, compared with a preliminary estimate of a 1.5 percent contraction, another survey showed. The government is due to release revised data tomorrow. “We may be seeing some tentative signs of bottoming,” said Johanna Chua, the Hong Kong-based head of Asian economic research at Citigroup Inc. “However, this bottoming is not indicative of a sharp rebound ahead. U.S. growth momentum in the coming months will likely continue to be weighed by fiscal cliff uncertainties, European data is surprising on the downside, and while China’s domestic demand is showing a rebound, in the absence of fresh stimulus, the rebound will remain mild.” Retail Sales Singapore’s retail sales rose for a second month in September from a year earlier, a report showed today. New Zealand’s manufacturing industry expanded in October after three months of contraction, according to a purchasing managers’ index. Gross domestic product in the euro area probably shrank 0.1 percent in the three months through September from the previous quarter, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before advance estimates due today. Germany, France, Italy and Spain will also release growth numbers. In the U.S., consumer prices probably rose 0.1 percent in October from the previous month, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Manufacturing in the New York region probably contracted for a fourth month in November, while initial jobless claims likely rose to 375,000 in the week ended Nov. 10, surveys showed. Bounce Back Worldwide, officials are becoming more confident about expansion prospects for next year.   South Korea ’s economy is expected to “bounce back” with stronger growth in 2013 as uncertainties over the global economy will likely ease, Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo, who held interest rates this month after two cuts earlier this year, said yesterday. Growth in most economies in Asia will probably rebound in 2013, Asian Development Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda said in Hong Kong today. Expansions in Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore will probably accelerate this quarter, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News from August to October. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said yesterday in Kuala Lumpur growth in Asia will pick up after slowing down this year, provided European and U.S. policy makers implement the right measures. Still, China’s new leaders headed by Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping will need to address an economy that Pacific Investment Management Co. forecast will grow the least in 23 years in 2013. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama is seeking ways to avoid $607 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts that threaten the world’s largest economy. “All eyes are on China and the U.S.,” said Frederic Neumann , co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC in Hong Kong. “Growth numbers are coming in weaker, as the strength of domestic demand in the region is not enough to offset the drag on exports. We need more stimulus to come through from China and we need the U.S. to avoid a fiscal cliff.” To contact the reporter on this story: Karl Lester M.

Vulnerabilities in the region persist even after the European Central Bank ’s bond-buying plan and the Federal Reserve ’s third round of quantitative easing cut financial- contagion risks, Liza Ermolenko, an emerging-market economist at London-based Capital, wrote in an e-mailed note. Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said yesterday the ECB’s bond-purchase plan isn’t enough to solve the debt crisis. Finnish Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen said today investors continue to “worry” about a possible breakup of the 17-member currency bloc. “We fear” that the ECB’s so-called Outright Monetary Transactions program to buy bonds “will just delay a further deepening of the euro crisis,” Ermolenko wrote. “If we are right and tensions in the euro zone do escalate, it would become markedly harder for banks in emerging Europe to roll over their debt.” Credit continues to shrink in the Baltic states and Hungary, while there are signs of a lending slowdown in Poland , Ermolenko wrote. Non-performing loans make up 18 percent of the total in Lithuania , 15.9 percent in Romania and 14.9 percent in Bulgaria , Capital said.

Please refer to weekly LM_XB459 as the item may qualify. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A cutout value is an average of the prices tallied for cuts of beef from cattle carcasses weighing 550-850 pounds. Cutout values are separated into three main product types. Fabricated loads are beef cuts taken from an animal's ribs, chuck, round, loin, brisket, short plate and flank; 50 percent loads are 50 percent lean beef trimmings. Ground loads may contain 73, 75, or 80 percent ground beef. A typical refrigerated truckload carries 40,000 pounds. Choice 1-3 grade is a better grade than Select 1-3, partly because Choice cuts have more fat, or marbling, than Select cuts. Grade quality is determined using a 1-5 yield grade scale. A rating of 1 is the highest ratio of muscle to fat, while 5 is the lowest.  Marbling is an important flavor factor.",['Michael Carone'],"USDA Boxed Beef Cutout Closing Prices for April 1 April 1 (Bloomberg) -- This table details boxed beef cutout prices supplied daily by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Cutout values are separated into three main product types. Fabricated loads are beef cuts taken from an animal's ribs, chuck, round, loin, brisket, short plate and flank; 50 percent loads are 50 percent lean beef trimmings. Ground loads may contain 73, 75, or 80 percent ground beef. A typical refrigerated truckload carries 40,000 pounds. Choice 1-3 grade is a better grade than Select 1-3, partly because Choice cuts have more fat, or marbling, than Select cuts. Grade quality is determined using a 1-5 yield grade scale. A rating of 1 is the highest ratio of muscle to fat, while 5 is the lowest.  Marbling is an important flavor factor.",11656,1547,288,89.23097170829915,20,0,False,14,4,2,False,True,5.791855203619909,0,13,15,4,neutral,0.863948404788971,neutral,0.863948404788971,neutral,0.9275403618812561,Ground Beef Loin Blended Ground Beef,5,Emerging
"Statoil Seeking Shale Oil Opportunities in Australia, China",['James Paton'],2012-09-21 02:28:44,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/statoil-seeking-shale-oil-opportunities-in-australia-china.html,"Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s largest oil and gas producer, is searching for a second shale partner in Australia following a deal with Canada’s PetroFrontier Corp. (PFC) and is also considering acquisitions of explorers. “We are actively looking for new opportunities in Australia,” Atle Rettedal, Statoil’s senior vice president for new ventures, said in an interview in the Northern Territory capital of Darwin, where he attended an industry conference. Statoil also is interested in shale opportunities in countries including Argentina and China, Rettedal said. Statoil, ConocoPhillips (COP) , Hess Corp., BG Group Plc (BG/) and Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) have agreed to fund shale exploration campaigns through partnerships in Australia. Statoil in June agreed to invest as much as $200 million in a drilling program in the Northern Territory’s Southern Georgina Basin with PetroFrontier. Stavanger, Norway-based Statoil is expanding internationally and into so-called unconventional resources as output from aging fields off its home country’s coast declines. The company, which operates about 80 percent of Norway’s oil and gas production, plans to boost output to at least 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2020 from about 2 million barrels currently. “If we make another move in Australia, it should happen in the coming year,” Rettedal said yesterday. “This is the window of opportunity. It’s not something that will happen five years from now. It’s happening now.” Shale Risk The company spent $4.4 billion acquiring Brigham Exploration Co. in December to enter the Bakken and Three Forks shale areas in the U.S. Also in the U.S., Statoil bought assets in the Marcellus formation in 2008 and formed a venture with Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM) in the Eagle Ford formation in 2010. Making shale oil and gas investments in stages is preferable, though purchasing a company in Australia is a possibility as well, Rettedal said. “It’s perfectly feasible that we could do that,” Rettedal said, referring to acquisitions. “When it comes to shale exploration, we have a preference for doing it stepwise because there is a risk. You are making a qualified bet.” Global energy companies such as Statoil are trying to tap what Australia’s government estimates is almost 400 trillion cubic feet of potential shale gas resources. Santos Ltd. (STO) , Beach Energy Ltd. (BPT) , Senex Energy Ltd. (SXY) and AWE Ltd. (AWE) are among Australian explorers holding shale acreage. Obstacles to Production Australian shale explorers may be a decade away from producing oil and gas on a large scale because of obstacles ranging from a lack of drilling equipment to higher labor and infrastructure costs, Wood Mackenzie Ltd. said in May. “Large-scale shale production in Australia , that will take time,” said Rettedal, who cited access to infrastructure in the country’s remote fields as one of the main challenges for the industry. “You might be right if you said 10 years.” Statoil agreed to acquire as much as 65 percent of PetroFrontier’s interests in four existing exploration blocks, plus two pending permits. The venture may drill as many as 20 wells by 2017 in three phases, according to the company.

"U.K. Homebuilders Likely to Seek Deals, Redfern Says",['Chris Spillane'],2012-11-12 11:32:08,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/u-k-homebuilders-likely-to-seek-deals-redfern-says.html,"U.K. homebuilders are more likely to acquire smaller competitors as the industry’s finances improve and companies seek better land, Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/) Chief Executive Officer Peter Redfern said. “Because performance is good and the sector is stable and balance sheets are strong, it’s feasible for M&A to happen,” Redfern said in an interview today. “It’s more likely than a year ago or two years ago, inevitably, because the market is more solid, balance sheets are better.” There hasn’t been a major merger in the U.K. homebuilding industry since 2007 when Taylor Woodrow Homes Inc. and George Wimpey Ltd. combined to form Taylor Wimpey, then valued at 5 billion pounds ($8 billion), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Taylor Wimpey is weighing an offer for closely held Scottish homebuilder Cala Homes, Sky News reported Nov. 7, without saying where it got the information. The London-based company, which today has a market value of 1.9 billion pounds, declined to comment on the report. Redfern said acquiring smaller competitors to gain land can make sense. “At the smaller end, particularly with regional house builders, perhaps where the funding is less good or where people are strong in particular markets, it is a feasible way of acquiring land,” Redfern said. “It’s more balanced than it was in the previous cycle.” Margins Widening Margins are widening at companies including Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV) and Persimmon Plc (PSN) after the housing market’s collapse in 2008 pressured homebuilders to slash costs to compensate for a slump in demand. At the same time, they took advantage of falling prices to buy cheaper land. Persimmon, the U.K.’s largest homebuilder by market value, widened its operating margin to 12.2 percent in the first half from 9 percent a year earlier. Taylor Wimpey increased its margin by 2.9 percentage points to 11.1 percent during the same period, while Barratt’s rose to 8.2 percent from 6.6 percent in fiscal 2012. The homebuilding industry is also set to profit from government efforts to stimulate growth in a business that’s been hurt by fewer mortgage approvals and falling prices. Plans include making it easier for home buyers to borrow, relaxing construction guidelines and giving banks incentive to lend. Taylor Wimpey, the U.K.’s second-largest homebuilder by volume, met its target for home completions through 2012, led by private sales, the company said in a statement today. Its order book was at 1.11 billion pounds of homes for the 19 weeks through Nov. 12 compared with 1.02 billion pounds a year earlier. Taylor Wimpey has risen more than 57 percent this year, the third-best performer in the Bloomberg EMEA Homebuilders’ Index (BEUHBLD) , which is up more than 50 percent this year. Redrow Plc (RDW) , a homebuilder based in Flint, Wales , was targeted by a group led by Chairman Steve Morgan in an approach that ended last month without an agreement.

Japan Post, which began offering Aflac’s cancer insurance products in October 2008, will sell the policies in as many as 20,000 post offices from the current 1,000, the U.S. insurer said in a statement through the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The two companies will also co-develop insurance products, according to the statement. The alliance comes amid Aflac’s effort to expand in Japan, its largest market, and discussions on the Trans Pacific Partnership regional trade deal. The U.S. has requested that Japan Post’s insurance subsidiary compete fairly with private companies.

It could lead to Japan Post selling different products to widen its offerings.” Japan earlier this year reached a deal with the U.S. on bilateral trade issues that clears the way for the world’s third-largest economy to join talks for the TPP trade agreement as soon as this month.

(CNK) unit was accused of failing to take security precautions in a lawsuit filed behalf of victims of the July 20 theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, in which 12 people were killed. James Holmes is accused of opening fire on the audience at a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises.” Holmes, who studied neuroscience at the University of Colorado -Denver, is charged in state court in Centennial with 24 counts of first- degree murder for the 12 people killed in the shooting. First- degree murder can carry the death penalty in Colorado. Before the shooting, Cinemark had information about previous disturbances at the theater, including at least one shooting as well as assaults and robberies, according to two complaints filed yesterday in federal court in Denver. Cinemark, though expecting large crowds, failed to provide security personnel for the midnight premier of the movie, according to the complaints. “The gunman made one or more trips from his car through the open exterior door” of the movie auditorium, “bringing his arsenal and ammunition through that open door,” according to one of the complaints. “Throughout that time, no employee or security personnel contacted him, deterred him, monitored him or stopped him from that re-entry.” James Meredith, a spokesman for Plano, Texas-based Cinemark, didn’t immediately return a call after regular business hours yesterday seeking comment on the lawsuits. Holmes Notebook Prosecutors yesterday dropped a bid to view the contents of a notebook Holmes sent to a psychiatrist just before the shooting. Holmes’s lawyers had argued that the notebook was subject to patient-doctor privilege and couldn’t be viewed by prosecutors. Deputy Arapahoe County District Attorney Rich Orman told Judge William Sylvester yesterday that any decision on the question would probably trigger an appeal that would delay the case “for a long time.” Also yesterday, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper said Ken Feinberg will serve as special master to oversee distribution of money donated to the Aurora Victim Relief Fund.

Brazil Orange Sales to EU Halted After Fungus Found,['Mario Sergio Lima' 'Marvin G.Perez'],2012-11-12 20:28:08,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/brazil-orange-sales-to-eu-halted-after-fungus-found.html,"Orange shipments from Brazil to the European Union were suspended after EU officials found samples with black spot fungus, a Brazilian government official said. Brazil, the world’s largest producer, halted the shipments on Oct. 24 after the EU reported that six containers of oranges were found with traces of the fungus, Cosam Coutinho, director of vegetable sanitation at the Agriculture Ministry , said in a telephone interview from Brasilia. Brazilian orange shipments represent less than 10 percent of the country’s citrus exports, which is mostly processed into orange juice before it’s sold overseas. The halt is unlikely to significantly affect orange juice futures since it only refers to the fruit, John Ortelle, a vice president at McKeany-Flavell Co., a broker in Oakland, California , said in an e-mailed response to questions. “We will have technical meetings with EU representatives to show our progress in dealing with the fungus before March, when the exports resume,” Coutinho said. Orange juice for January delivery fell 1 percent to settle at $1.061 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The price has tumbled 37 percent this year amid slowing demand in the U.S. and higher production in Florida, the world’s second- biggest citrus grower. Brazil’s orange sales to the EU usually cease by November, when European import tariffs for the fruit are raised to encourage purchases from local suppliers, making exports less attractive, Coutinho said.

Gold Selloff Drives Commodity Investments to Lowest in 32 Months,['Maria Kolesnikova'],2013-07-19 16:23:15,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/gold-selloff-drives-commodity-investments-to-lowest-in-32-months.html,"Commodity assets under management fell to a 32-month low in June as investors pulled more money from gold-backed exchange-traded products, Barclays Plc said. Assets dropped to $349 billion from $367 billion in May, the London-based bank said in a report e-mailed today. Investments in precious-metals ETPs slid to $107 billion from $122 billion. Assets held in gold-backed ETPs declined 66.5 metric tons to a three-year low, a sixth month of redemptions, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Bullion tumbled 11 percent in June, the most since September 2011, as some investors lost faith in gold as a store of value and the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated it may start tapering its record bond-buying program. Metals including silver and copper also retreated last month, while crude oil and rice were among raw materials that rose. “Liquidation of gold ETPs continues to be the main factor driving commodity assets under management lower,” Barclays analyst Suki Cooper wrote in the report. “Other commodity assets have been much more stable.” The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index of 24 raw materials rose 0.2 percent in June, the first gain in three, and is up 1 percent this year. Gold for immediate delivery plunged 23 percent so far in 2013 and silver is down 36 percent. Fed Policy “Gold and silver face the most downside risk in the third quarter,” Cooper wrote. “Gold continues to take its cue from U.S. Fed policy.” The central bank’s bond purchases “are by no means on a preset course” and will depend on the U.S. economy’s performance, Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said this week. Gold is still down 5.5 percent since he signaled May 22 the stimulus may slow. Assets in ETPs backed by gold plunged 25 percent this year as investors pulled a record 653 tons from the funds, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Holdings of 1,978.9 tons are the lowest since May 2010, according to the figures.

Assets dropped to $349 billion from $367 billion in May, the London-based bank said in a report e-mailed today. Investments in precious-metals ETPs slid to $107 billion from $122 billion. Assets held in gold-backed ETPs declined 66.5 metric tons to a three-year low, a sixth month of redemptions, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Bullion tumbled 11 percent in June, the most since September 2011, as some investors lost faith in gold as a store of value and the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated it may start tapering its record bond-buying program. Metals including silver and copper also retreated last month, while crude oil and rice were among raw materials that rose. “Liquidation of gold ETPs continues to be the main factor driving commodity assets under management lower,” Barclays analyst Suki Cooper wrote in the report. “Other commodity assets have been much more stable.” The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index of 24 raw materials rose 0.2 percent in June, the first gain in three, and is up 1 percent this year. Gold for immediate delivery plunged 23 percent so far in 2013 and silver is down 36 percent. Fed Policy “Gold and silver face the most downside risk in the third quarter,” Cooper wrote. “Gold continues to take its cue from U.S. Fed policy.” The central bank’s bond purchases “are by no means on a preset course” and will depend on the U.S. economy’s performance, Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said this week. Gold is still down 5.5 percent since he signaled May 22 the stimulus may slow. Assets in ETPs backed by gold plunged 25 percent this year as investors pulled a record 653 tons from the funds, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Holdings of 1,978.9 tons are the lowest since May 2010, according to the figures.

Donilon Says China Cyber Attacks Hurt Bid for Better Ties,['Flavia Krause-Jackson'],2013-03-12 08:41:45,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/china-cyber-attacks-harm-u-s-bid-for-tighter-ties-donilon-says.html,"China is waging a campaign of cyber espionage against U.S. companies that is threatening to derail President Barack Obama ’s second-term effort to improve ties, National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon said. The widespread theft of intellectual property and trade secrets through “cyber intrusions emanating from China at a very large scale” has become a point of contention with the Chinese government, Donilon said yesterday in a speech at the Asia Society in New York. His comments marked the latest step in Obama administration efforts to curb attacks on corporate networks that U.S. intelligence agencies and security firms such as Mandiant Corp. have traced to China. He said it was time to hold China accountable for “a growing challenge” to economic relations. Donilon, who helps shape U.S. foreign policy, said China needs to recognize the scope of the hacking issue, take steps to halt computer espionage and start a “constructive dialogue” with the U.S. on standards for conduct in cyberspace. “We have worked hard to build a constructive bilateral relationship that allows us to engage forthrightly on priority issues,” he said in his prepared remarks. “The United States and China, the world’s two largest economies, both dependent on the Internet, must lead the way in addressing this problem.” Donilon discussed cybersecurity as part of a broader address on the U.S. foreign policy shift toward Asia , a change in direction from the Middle East that was announced in the president’s first term. Donilon stressed that the shift wasn’t designed to rein in China, the world’s second-largest economy. Protect Peace China is itself a victim of hacking and firmly opposes cyber-attacks, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a briefing in Beijing today. She said China will work with the international community, including the U.S., to “protect peace, safety, openness and cooperation in cyberspace.” Rebalancing U.S. priorities toward the Pacific “does not mean containing China or seeking to dictate terms to Asia,” said Donilon. Obama has “engaged with China at an unprecedented pace, including twelve face-to-face meetings with Hu Jintao ,” he said, referring to the departing Chinese leader. Even with tensions over cybersecurity, Donilon said the time and energy devoted by the U.S. to China and its neighbors have already paid dividends. He cited Chinese cooperation last week on tougher United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea , which has ignored repeated calls to suspend its pursuit of nuclear weapons. China had the power to veto UN action against North Korea, its increasingly volatile ally. Korean Peninsula Tensions on the Korean peninsula are at the highest since at least 2010, when 50 South Koreans were killed in attacks by the North. Dictator Kim Jong Un’s regime has increased its bellicose rhetoric since the sanctions were tightened, threatening to launch a nuclear strike against South Korea and the U.S., which are conducting annual joint military drills. “North Korea’s claims may be hyperbolic -- but as to the policy of the United States, there should be no doubt: We will draw upon the full range of our capabilities to protect against, and to respond to, the threat posed to us and to our allies by North Korea,” said Donilon. Donilon cited Myanmar, which the administration still refers to as Burma , as a model of transition from repressive regime to burgeoning democracy. The emergence of Myanmar from isolation coincided with Obama’s first term in office. Burma Experience “I urge North Korea’s leaders to reflect on Burma’s experience,” he said. “While the work of reform is ongoing, Burma has already broken out of isolation and opened the door to a far better future for its people.” After deepening cross-Pacific economic ties during the 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. under President Bill Clinton spearheaded financial bailouts during the Asian financial crisis. The ensuing administration of George W. Bush turned its attention to the Middle East and Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the U.S., before Obama embarked on the “pivot” in attention back to Asia. “Obama’s strategic focus on the Asia-Pacific is already a signature achievement,” he told the Asia Society in New York. “But its full impact will require sustained commitment over the coming years.” On cybersecurity, Donilon said the U.S. would do everything necessary to shield the nation’s computer networks from attacks on vital infrastructure, such as power grids and transportation links. The issue surged after Alexandria, Virginia-based Mandiant said in a Feb. 19 report that the Chinese army may be behind a hacking group that has hit at least 141 companies worldwide since 2006. Shaky Ground Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said March 9 that news articles blaming China’s government and military for computer hacking are on “shaky ground,” and such stories serve political motives. China opposes turning cyberspace into a “new battlefield” and countries should introduce global rules to govern conduct, Yang told reporters at a press conference during the National People’s Congress in Beijing. U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers has said that cybersecurity should be made the top issue in any U.S. trade discussions with China as a way to pressure the government in Beijing to halt computer espionage. Rogers, a Michigan Republican, has accused China of widespread digital spying aimed at stealing intellectual property from U.S. companies. “We have to deal with it now or we’re going to have a horrible problem,” Rogers said in a March 1 interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg Television’s “Bloomberg West.” “If they want to be great international players in the international global economic market, you can’t act like a thief.” To contact the reporter on this story: Flavia Krause-Jackson in United Nations at  fjackson@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: John Walcott at  jwalcott9@bloomberg.net",['Flavia Krause-Jackson'],"Donilon Says China Cyber Attacks Hurt Bid for Better Ties China is waging a campaign of cyber espionage against U.S. companies that is threatening to derail President Barack Obama ’s second-term effort to improve ties, National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon said.

Kelusa Capital China Seeks Money for Fund After Gains,['Netty Ismail'],2011-10-21 09:09:58,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/-tiger-cub-kelusa-seeks-money-for-china-hedge-fund-after-beating-stocks.html,"(Corrects to clarify that the fund isn’t backed by Julian Robertson in the first paragraph of story published Oct. 6.) Kelusa Capital China , a Singapore- based hedge fund firm, plans to increase assets almost five times to $250 million after its fund outperformed the nation’s stocks. Kelusa Capital China, which focuses on the world’s second- largest economy and has assets of about $55 million, gained more than 7 percent this year through September, said Kenton Leo, the founding partner of the fund. The MSCI China (MXCN) , which mostly tracks Hong Kong-traded shares of Chinese companies, slumped more than 26 percent during the period, while Asia-focused hedge funds lost about 7 percent, according to Singapore-based Eurekahedge Pte. The government is wrestling with elevated inflation and the threat of a deeper economic slowdown because of the debt crisis in Europe. “Panic creates opportunities,” Leo said. “The list of stocks that I have today that are at all-time low valuations is growing daily as we speak because things are getting sold down indiscriminately.” The fund, which expects to have positive returns in rising and falling markets, will initially focus on preserving capital and subsequently invest when the market panic subsides over the next 18 to 24 months, Leo said. The fund, which holds about 60 percent in cash, fell 1.7 percent in September, while the MSCI China gauge slumped 17 percent, he said. Tiger Cubs Robert McCreary, the founder of New York-based Kelusa Capital Group, is an adviser to Kelusa Capital China. From 1991 to 1995, he focused on Asian investments at Tiger Management LLC. McCreary was previously a founding partner of Banyan Fund Management, which he closed in 2004 before setting up Kelusa Capital. Leo worked at Banyan and Kelusa Capital. Kelusa Capital Group is one of the so-called Tiger Cubs, a group of hedge-fund managers either backed by Julian Robertson or who worked at Tiger Management, which he founded in 1980 and built into one of the world’s largest hedge funds before returning clients’ money in 2000. Kelusa Capital China, which started investing in August 2009, is seeking to raise capital from investors wanting low- volatility returns regardless of how the market performs, said Leo, who also oversees Kelusa Capital Master Fund’s investments in Chinese stocks. The correlation of the fund to the market is negative 1 percent, Leo said. “We’re very focused on thinking about picking companies that will underperform and outperform the market, and constructing a portfolio where company fundamentals drive the fund performance, rather than big macro events” Leo said. “Japanese earthquakes or events in Europe don’t cause big swings in our performance.” Tough Raising Funds Hedge funds have found it tough to raise capital as investors shifted to experienced managers or established firms with steady returns and staff dedicated to risk assessment after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 led many funds to freeze assets. Firms managing more than $500 million received almost 62 percent of the capital invested in Asia- focused hedge funds in the second quarter, according to Chicago- based Hedge Fund Research Inc. “My impressions from my recent interaction with China- based managers and regional managers is the capital raising environment is very tough short term,” said Simon Hopkins, chief executive officer of Singapore-based Milltrust International Group, which helps hedge funds focusing on emerging markets set up managed accounts for institutions. “The China-based managers haven’t raised assets and the Hong Kong and regional managers are also finding the current environment very challenging.” China Slowdown Kelusa Capital China is betting on a decline in stocks linked to Chinese luxury consumption “that are in for some pretty big downgrades,” Leo said. Government curbs on lending and the real-estate industry to damp inflation are slowing demand in China. A slump in global investor confidence and heightened risks of recession in the U.S. and euro area economies are weighing on the outlook for exports. The fund is looking to buy shares in companies that are at all-time low valuations such as container shipping firms, ports and exporters, Leo said. “These companies are being hurt by a slowdown in China exports, but borderline bankruptcy is being put into these valuations,” Leo said. “There will be an impact, but this entire sector is not going to go bankrupt.” To contact the reporter on this story: Netty Ismail in Singapore  nismail3@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Andreea Papuc at  apapuc1@bloomberg.net",['Netty Ismail'],"Kelusa Capital China Seeks Money for Fund After Gains (Corrects to clarify that the fund isn’t backed by Julian Robertson in the first paragraph of story published Oct. 6.)

U.S. Postal Service on a ‘Tightrope’ Lost $15.9 Billion,['Angela Greiling Keane'],2012-11-15 15:50:02,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/u-s-postal-service-on-tightrope-loses-15-9-billion.html,"The U.S. Postal Service said its net loss last year widened to $15.9 billion, more than the $15 billion it had projected, as mail volume continued to drop, falling 5 percent. Without action by Congress, the service will run out of cash on Oct. 15, 2013, after it makes a required workers compensation payment to the U.S. Labor Department and before revenue typically jumps with holiday-season mailing, Chief Financial Officer Joe Corbett said today. The service, whose fiscal year ends Sept. 30, lost $5.1 billion a year earlier. It announced the 2012 net loss at a meeting at its Washington headquarters. “We are walking a financial tightrope,” Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said at the meeting. “Will we ever stop delivering the mail? It will never happen. We are simply too important to the economy and the flow of commerce.” The Postal Service uses about $250 million a day to operate and will have less than four days of cash on hand by the end of the fiscal year, Corbett said. The service is asking Congress to enact legislation before it adjourns this year that would allow the Postal Service to spread future retirees’ health-benefit payments over more years, stop Saturday mail delivery, and more easily close post offices and processing plants. Over Edge “The Postal Service is facing a fiscal cliff of its own and any unanticipated drop in mail volumes could send the agency over the edge,” said Art Sackler , co-coordinator of the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, whose members include Bank of America Corp. and EBay Inc. (EBAY)  “If Congress fails to act, there could be postal slowdowns or shutdowns that would have catastrophic consequences for the 8 million private sector workers whose jobs depend on the mail.” Without legislative change, the service expects its losses to continue in 2013, with a forecast loss of $7.6 billion for the year that started Oct. 1, Corbett said. “There is no margin of error,” given the low level of cash, he said. The service is trying to cut costs by giving retirement- eligible workers a financial incentive to retire. Those employees have a Dec. 3 deadline to accept the offer, with $200 million budgeted for the incentive costs in fiscal 2013. Health Benefits Next year’s loss forecast includes a $5.6 billion payment due to the U.S. Treasury for future retiree health benefits, Corbett told reporters after the meeting. The 2012 loss includes the $5.6 billion payment to the fund that the service defaulted on Sept. 30, and the previous year’s $5.5 billion obligation that was due Aug. 1 and also not paid. Because that year’s payment was deferred, the 2011 loss doesn’t include any pre- funding amount. Mail volume for the year fell to 159.9 billion pieces, led by an 8 percent decrease in single-piece first-class items, the most profitable kind of mail that includes letters, cards and bill payments. Operating revenue fell less than 1 percent to $65.2 billion for the year as the service cut work hours while delivering less mail. The service’s outlook worsened this week, when the U.S. Office of Personnel Management said the service’s projected surplus in a government-worker retirement account has fallen to $2.6 billion, less than one-quarter of the previous year’s estimate, due to lower interest rates. It found another retirement account now has a $17.8 billion shortfall instead of a previously estimated surplus. The service has proposed tapping the surpluses to help cover its losses. “Relying on a temporary, projected surplus to keep USPS solvent is a risk no matter which set of assumptions OPM is directed to use,” said Ali Ahmad, a spokesman for House Government and Reform Committee Chairman Darrel Issa, a California Republican who is a sponsor of a postal overhaul measure pending in the House. “It is no substitute for the actual cost-cutting USPS needs to do to find real savings.” To contact the reporter on this story: Angela Greiling Keane in Washington at  agreilingkea@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Bernard Kohn at  bkohn2@bloomberg.net",['Angela Greiling Keane'],"U.S. Postal Service on a ‘Tightrope’ Lost $15.9 Billion The U.S. Postal Service said its net loss last year widened to $15.9 billion, more than the $15 billion it had projected, as mail volume continued to drop, falling 5 percent. Without action by Congress, the service will run out of cash on Oct. 15, 2013, after it makes a required workers compensation payment to the U.S. Labor Department and before revenue typically jumps with holiday-season mailing, Chief Financial Officer Joe Corbett said today. The service, whose fiscal year ends Sept. 30, lost $5.1 billion a year earlier. It announced the 2012 net loss at a meeting at its Washington headquarters. “We are walking a financial tightrope,” Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said at the meeting. “Will we ever stop delivering the mail? It will never happen. We are simply too important to the economy and the flow of commerce.” The Postal Service uses about $250 million a day to operate and will have less than four days of cash on hand by the end of the fiscal year, Corbett said. The service is asking Congress to enact legislation before it adjourns this year that would allow the Postal Service to spread future retirees’ health-benefit payments over more years, stop Saturday mail delivery, and more easily close post offices and processing plants. Over Edge “The Postal Service is facing a fiscal cliff of its own and any unanticipated drop in mail volumes could send the agency over the edge,” said Art Sackler , co-coordinator of the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, whose members include Bank of America Corp. and EBay Inc. (EBAY)  “If Congress fails to act, there could be postal slowdowns or shutdowns that would have catastrophic consequences for the 8 million private sector workers whose jobs depend on the mail.” Without legislative change, the service expects its losses to continue in 2013, with a forecast loss of $7.6 billion for the year that started Oct. 1, Corbett said. “There is no margin of error,” given the low level of cash, he said. The service is trying to cut costs by giving retirement- eligible workers a financial incentive to retire. Those employees have a Dec. 3 deadline to accept the offer, with $200 million budgeted for the incentive costs in fiscal 2013. Health Benefits Next year’s loss forecast includes a $5.6 billion payment due to the U.S. Treasury for future retiree health benefits, Corbett told reporters after the meeting. The 2012 loss includes the $5.6 billion payment to the fund that the service defaulted on Sept. 30, and the previous year’s $5.5 billion obligation that was due Aug. 1 and also not paid. Because that year’s payment was deferred, the 2011 loss doesn’t include any pre- funding amount. Mail volume for the year fell to 159.9 billion pieces, led by an 8 percent decrease in single-piece first-class items, the most profitable kind of mail that includes letters, cards and bill payments. Operating revenue fell less than 1 percent to $65.2 billion for the year as the service cut work hours while delivering less mail. The service’s outlook worsened this week, when the U.S. Office of Personnel Management said the service’s projected surplus in a government-worker retirement account has fallen to $2.6 billion, less than one-quarter of the previous year’s estimate, due to lower interest rates.

Coal States Crucial in Battle for Control of Congress,['Derek Wallbank'],2012-09-22 04:00:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/coal-states-crucial-in-battle-for-control-of-congress.html,"For Republicans in the U.S. House, the math is simple: Keep the coal seats, stay in power. The very last piece of legislation the House voted on yesterday before leaving for the campaign trail is called the Stop the War on Coal Act of 2012. It’s a combination of five bills, four of which the House has passed in one form or another. All four have have gone nowhere in the Senate. The bill, H.R. 3409, would block any federal regulation that could harm the coal mining industry for at least a year while delaying, rolling back or adding layers of scrutiny to dozens more regulations. “This is about laying out a road map for the future,” said Representative Glenn Thompson, a Pennsylvania Republican whose district includes coal mines. If Republicans retain the House, he said, expect to see more coal bills when the new Congress takes over in January. A look at the electoral map shows why the Republican majority made support for the coal industry’s priorities one of its priorities. For Democrats to retake the House, they must win a net of 25 seats. The top 12 coal-producing states , each of which account for at least 2 percent of the nation’s coal, include 24 competitive House districts, according to state coal production data compiled by Bloomberg and House election ratings from the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Coal-State Lawmakers Republicans hold 19 of those 24 House seats. Two of the remaining five, held by Democrats, are open seats. The others are represented by Nick Rahall, whose southern West Virginia district includes the Spruce No. 1 mine owned by Arch Coal Inc. (ACI) ; Mark Critz, whose southwestern Pennsylvania district includes Quecreek, known for a 2002 coal-mine accident; and Ben Chandler, whose central Kentucky district includes the headquarters of the Kentucky Coal Association. Rahall, Critz and Chandler all voted for the bill. Among the companies lobbying for it was St. Louis-based Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) , the largest U.S. coal producer by volume. Representative Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat, said the bill, which was passed by a vote of 233-175, has nothing to do with policy and everything to do with Republicans communicating to constituents before Election Day. ‘Let’s Message’ “This is ‘Let’s message to our core constituency with legislation we know has no chance of passing,’” Quigley said in an interview. The voters in coal country “tend to be blue-collar,” Jennifer Duffy , a political analyst with the Cook Political Report in Washington, said in a telephone interview. Duffy said that message -- coal equals jobs, and less coal equals fewer jobs -- is being played across coal-producing states, especially in West Virginia, where in some towns the options for employment range from working in the coal industry to working at a job supported by the coal industry. Long the mainstay of U.S. power generation, coal has been losing ground to natural gas after new reserves of that fossil fuel drove prices down to 10-year lows earlier this year. Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) of Bristol, Virginia, the No. 2 coal producer by volume, said this week that it will reduce annual production by 16 million tons, about 16 percent of 2011 output, and eliminate 1,200 jobs through early 2013. The company is among producers that have cut or plan to cut output this year after some power stations switched to using natural gas, and prices dropped for metallurgical, or coking, coal used to make steel. Rahall’s Fight A good test of the potency of the Republicans’ message will be Rahall’s re-election race in West Virginia , the second- largest coal state. Rahall said he committed to voting for the Republicans’ five-part bill before he had read the 80-page measure. “Let me put it this way: Anything that harms our coal industry I have and will continue to oppose,” he said in an interview. In fact, Rahall didn’t need to hear the end of a question - - “Is there a war on coal?” -- before almost shouting “Yes!” “Who’s fighting it? I’m fighting it,” Rahall said. “Who’s conducting it? The EPA.” The Environmental Protection Agency issued proposed rules this year that would effectively preclude the construction of new coal-fired power plants that don’t have expensive carbon- capture and storage technology. Front Lines Speaking on the House floor, Rahall said he knows “quite possibly better than anyone else” in the House “how the regulatory arm of government can wreak havoc on the people we represent.” “The real front lines of this war on coal are not here in Washington,” he said. “They run through the hills and hollows of southern West Virginia. And the true soldiers in this war are our coal miners who simply want to do their jobs and earn an honest living to provide for their families.” The vigor of Rahall’s argument may make a difference as he goes after a 19th term in the House. When Republicans convened a press conference at the Capitol this morning, they had some laid-off miners on hand, including Franklin Kinchen of Drawdy, West Virginia, who said he is a United Mine Workers member out of work since May 1, when his job ended at a Patriot Coal Corp. (PCXCQ) mine. Tiny’s Vote Kinchen, a large man with a beard, a buzz cut and the nickname “Tiny,” described himself as eager to vote against President Barack Obama. Yet he’s sticking with another Democrat, Rahall, who delivered a stemwinding speech on the House floor yesterday in support of the coal bill. “I’ve never been prouder to have him as my representative,” Kinchen said. Republicans are running a candidate, Rick Snuffer, who is just as enthusiastic about coal and who doesn’t share a political party with Obama. Obama, who has threatened to veto the coal bill, has become so unpopular in West Virginia that 40 percent of the Democratic primary vote went to an unknown who turned out to be a prisoner in Texas. Voters may have to be willing to ticket-split -- as Kinchen is for Rahall -- to win re-election. The Cook Political Report’s rating has Rahall favored in the race. “If he loses,” Duffy said, “coal is why.” To contact the reporter on this story: Derek Wallbank in Washington at  dwallbank@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Katherine Rizzo at  krizzo5@bloomberg.net",['Derek Wallbank'],"Coal States Crucial in Battle for Control of Congress For Republicans in the U.S. House, the math is simple: Keep the coal seats, stay in power.

"Armstrong Case Doesn’t End Anti-Doping Work, Wada Says",['Albertina Torsoli' 'Danielle Rossingh'],2012-11-12 17:29:40,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/armstrong-case-doesn-t-end-anti-doping-work-wada-says.html,"Professional sports may never be entirely clear of doping, and needs help from pharmaceutical companies to catch cheats, the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency said. “We are getting better, but doping is still out there, and more than I wish it was,” WADA President John Fahey told reporters during a press conference in Paris today. Sports “isn’t cleaner” after the Lance Armstrong case, he said. The Texan cyclist was stripped of his 1999-2005 Tour de France victories and banned for life from competing in sanctioned events by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. The American body cited a career “fueled from start to finish by doping” when it released a 202-page summary of its investigation into the rider and the U.S. Postal Service cycling team on Oct. 10. “We can be proud of what has been achieved so far,” French Sports Minister Valerie Fourneyron said during a doping conference in Paris today. The USADA’s “exceptional” work “led to the fall of a man who pretended to be the world’s best cyclist, but in fact was nothing but the biggest cheat.” On Oct. 22 the International Cycling Union said it endorsed the USADA decision and wouldn’t appeal it to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. WADA wants more blood tests among athletes, as it’s the only way to find some performance-enhancing substances, and the agency is pushing for the creation of so-called blood passports, David Howman, WADA’s director general, said in an interview in Paris today. Police Help Still, urine tests and blood samples aren’t enough to uncover cheating, Howman said. WADA is working more closely with Interpol, police and customs officers to “gather evidence in other ways,” he said. “Testing is not the ultimate panacea,” Howman said. In the Armstrong case, “there’s not much from the scientific analyses that led to the downfall of the whole conspiracy,” he said. “It’s not just Armstrong,” Howman said. “We talk a lot about the athlete, but there were the trainer, the doctors” and the rest of the cyclist’s entourage. The cheating was “all” discovered “through information received from witnesses,” he added. Large drugmakers and smaller biotechnology companies also need to get more involved to help find ways to stop athletes from improperly using medicines to cheat, Fahey and Howman said. New Chances Athletes use approved medicines but they also resort to experimental drugs to enhance their performance. Any information on products in the early phases of clinical testing can help develop screening tests more quickly, Howman said. “We are running a campaign of door knocking,” to contact major drugmakers for help, he said, declining to cite specific company names. “The benefit for the pharmaceutical industry is that we also become aware of things that are being used in the black market and the black market is something the industry wants to clamp down on,” Howman added. London-based drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) has an agreement with WADA to alert the agency to any performance-enhancing compound in its drug pipeline, including a compound’s chemical structure, to help WADA “begin work on detection methods,” Philip Thomson, Glaxo’s senior vice president for global communications, said today. New Compounds Glaxo is working with WADA on three molecules in its pipeline, including one at a more advanced stage of development, Thomson said. “Through this work, we’ve learned that our initial questions, such as how much of our scientists’ time will this take, and will we be able to maintain confidentiality, have all been answered positively,” Thomson said. “We believe this initiative can be taken forward more broadly across the industry.” Roche Holding AG (ROG) also is helping WADA in its fight against doping, said Philippe Van der Auwera, global head of drug safety at the Basel, Switzerland-based company. Still, convincing other drugmakers to share sensitive information on their experimental molecules won’t be easy, Howman said. “It’s a significant impediment because to earn their confidence you have to show you deserve the confidence,” he said. “A lot of people take some time to be convinced.” Titles The International Olympic Committee on Nov. 1 opened an investigation into Armstrong’s bronze medal at the 2000 Games in Sydney. The Texan faces losing the medal he won in the time- trial event after being stripped of his Tour titles. Armstrong, who has denied doping and said he never failed a drug test, declined to take the USADA case to arbitration. Doping is increasingly becoming an issue as athletes now have easier access to performance-enhancing substances through the Internet, turning this into a public-health problem, Howman said. “If parents knew what their kids were taking from people that hand stuff out at the gym, they would be absolutely horrified,” Howman said. Armstrong is not the only athlete touched by tougher anti- doping policies. In August, the IOC stripped Tyler Hamilton of the U.S. of his time-trial gold medal from the 2004 Athens games after he admitted doping. Russian silver medalist Viatcheslav Ekimov was awarded the gold instead. “We need a new deal for a cleaner sport,” Getachew Engida , deputy director general of the UN cultural agency, UNESCO, said today. “There are no chemical shortcuts to victory.” To contact the reporters on this story: Albertina Torsoli in Paris at  atorsoli@bloomberg.net ; Danielle Rossingh in London at  drossingh@bloomberg.net.

The Texan cyclist was stripped of his 1999-2005 Tour de France victories and banned for life from competing in sanctioned events by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. The American body cited a career “fueled from start to finish by doping” when it released a 202-page summary of its investigation into the rider and the U.S. Postal Service cycling team on Oct. 10. “We can be proud of what has been achieved so far,” French Sports Minister Valerie Fourneyron said during a doping conference in Paris today. The USADA’s “exceptional” work “led to the fall of a man who pretended to be the world’s best cyclist, but in fact was nothing but the biggest cheat.” On Oct. 22 the International Cycling Union said it endorsed the USADA decision and wouldn’t appeal it to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. WADA wants more blood tests among athletes, as it’s the only way to find some performance-enhancing substances, and the agency is pushing for the creation of so-called blood passports, David Howman, WADA’s director general, said in an interview in Paris today. Police Help Still, urine tests and blood samples aren’t enough to uncover cheating, Howman said. WADA is working more closely with Interpol, police and customs officers to “gather evidence in other ways,” he said. “Testing is not the ultimate panacea,” Howman said. In the Armstrong case, “there’s not much from the scientific analyses that led to the downfall of the whole conspiracy,” he said. “It’s not just Armstrong,” Howman said. “We talk a lot about the athlete, but there were the trainer, the doctors” and the rest of the cyclist’s entourage. The cheating was “all” discovered “through information received from witnesses,” he added. Large drugmakers and smaller biotechnology companies also need to get more involved to help find ways to stop athletes from improperly using medicines to cheat, Fahey and Howman said. New Chances Athletes use approved medicines but they also resort to experimental drugs to enhance their performance. Any information on products in the early phases of clinical testing can help develop screening tests more quickly, Howman said. “We are running a campaign of door knocking,” to contact major drugmakers for help, he said, declining to cite specific company names. “The benefit for the pharmaceutical industry is that we also become aware of things that are being used in the black market and the black market is something the industry wants to clamp down on,” Howman added. London-based drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) has an agreement with WADA to alert the agency to any performance-enhancing compound in its drug pipeline, including a compound’s chemical structure, to help WADA “begin work on detection methods,” Philip Thomson, Glaxo’s senior vice president for global communications, said today. New Compounds Glaxo is working with WADA on three molecules in its pipeline, including one at a more advanced stage of development, Thomson said. “Through this work, we’ve learned that our initial questions, such as how much of our scientists’ time will this take, and will we be able to maintain confidentiality, have all been answered positively,” Thomson said. “We believe this initiative can be taken forward more broadly across the industry.” Roche Holding AG (ROG) also is helping WADA in its fight against doping, said Philippe Van der Auwera, global head of drug safety at the Basel, Switzerland-based company. Still, convincing other drugmakers to share sensitive information on their experimental molecules won’t be easy, Howman said. “It’s a significant impediment because to earn their confidence you have to show you deserve the confidence,” he said. “A lot of people take some time to be convinced.” Titles The International Olympic Committee on Nov. 1 opened an investigation into Armstrong’s bronze medal at the 2000 Games in Sydney. The Texan faces losing the medal he won in the time- trial event after being stripped of his Tour titles. Armstrong, who has denied doping and said he never failed a drug test, declined to take the USADA case to arbitration. Doping is increasingly becoming an issue as athletes now have easier access to performance-enhancing substances through the Internet, turning this into a public-health problem, Howman said. “If parents knew what their kids were taking from people that hand stuff out at the gym, they would be absolutely horrified,” Howman said. Armstrong is not the only athlete touched by tougher anti- doping policies. In August, the IOC stripped Tyler Hamilton of the U.S. of his time-trial gold medal from the 2004 Athens games after he admitted doping. Russian silver medalist Viatcheslav Ekimov was awarded the gold instead. “We need a new deal for a cleaner sport,” Getachew Engida , deputy director general of the UN cultural agency, UNESCO, said today. “There are no chemical shortcuts to victory.” To contact the reporters on this story: Albertina Torsoli in Paris at  atorsoli@bloomberg.net ; Danielle Rossingh in London at  drossingh@bloomberg.net.

SAC’s Cohen Risks Losing Fortune While Keeping Freedom,['Patricia Hurtado' 'David Voreacos'],2013-07-26 04:01:05,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/sac-s-cohen-risks-losing-fortune-while-keeping-freedom.html,"Steven A. Cohen , founder of a $14 billion hedge fund indicted in what the U.S. calls an unprecedented insider trading scheme, faces a future without a fund or a multibillion-dollar fortune. On the other hand, he won’t be behind bars. The U.S. wants to recover hundreds of millions of dollars from Cohen’s fund, SAC Capital Advisors LP, representing the money it made from its alleged illegal trading, and may try to get billions more from Cohen and the company. Cohen himself wasn’t charged, unlike at least eight former SAC fund managers and analysts who have faced or are facing fraud charges for their roles in a scheme which allegedly involved more than 20 companies and went back as far as 1999. The government has also filed civil money-laundering charges against the firm, which call for fines and penalties to be determined at a trial, the date of which hasn’t been set. Those civil charges pose the greatest threat to Cohen’s fortune because prosecutors allege that if the fund reinvested the proceeds of illegal insider trading into its capital pool, then the entire pool is tainted and subject to forfeiture. “Forfeiture, restitution and fines are the real worry for SAC,” said John J. Carney, a former federal securities fraud prosecutor and SEC attorney now at Baker Hostetler LLP. “If the government can establish the alleged fraudulent profits with precision, then they may have the ability to wipe out the firm’s net capital, making bankruptcy or a receivership a real threat.” Commingling Profits In its civil suit, the U.S. alleges that SAC engaged in money laundering, “commingling the illegal profits from insider trading with other assets, using the profits to promote additional insider trading.” The government also filed criminal charges against SAC, allowing it to seek forfeiture of ill-gotten gains obtained as a result of the crime, if the firm is convicted. That might allow the government to make a sizable dent in Cohen’s own wealth: with $9 billion, he’s ranked 121st among the world’s billionaires, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Citing laws that say it has the right to seek the forfeiture of any property involved in money laundering transactions, the government says it is seeking “any and all assets” of SAC Capital Advisors LP, SAC Capital Advisors LLC, CR Intrinsic Investors LLC, Sigma Capital Management LLC, and more than 20 other affiliated investment funds, according to the complaint. Ruinous Restitution Michael Shapiro, the co-chair of the white-collar defense practice at Carter Ledyard & Milburn in New York , said a conviction of SAC may lead to “enormous fines and potentially ruinous amounts of restitution” from the firm. Prosecutors may seek billions of dollars from Cohen’s personal fortune by claiming in the criminal case and their civil forfeiture lawsuit that he “co-mingled” illegal profits from insider trading with other assets he legitimately earned, Shapiro said. “His house, his art -- they can go after that,” Shapiro said. Cohen is one of the world’s biggest art collectors, with works by Van Gogh , Manet, de Kooning, Picasso, Cezanne, Warhol, Johns and Richter. Determining whether Cohen’s own assets include proceeds of SAC’s insider trading will be “a battle for the forensic accountants” that may take years, said Jacob Frenkel , a former SEC lawyer now with Shulman Rogers Gandal Pordy & Ecker PA in Potomac, Maryland. Bharara Success The government has presented a case that it’s likely to win, given the success rate Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office has had against insider traders. The office has won convictions at trial or in guilty pleas in 100 percent of the cases brought. That could herald the demise of Cohen’s fund, which has about $13.9 billion under management, of which about $7.5 billion is part of Cohen’s own $9 billion fortune. “This is effectively a death knell” for SAC, Carney said. “Clearly, the Justice Department must have made the determination that there were so many corrupt employees that they outweighed the other honest employees.” It's not the first time Bharara has sought charges against a business. In February 2012, his office charged Wegelin & Co., Switzerland ’s oldest private bank, for helping U.S. taxpayers hide assets from the Internal Revenue Service. Wegelin pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay almost $58 million. While he declined to comment on the possibility of charges against Cohen, Bharara said the investigation was “ongoing,” and that the government isn’t “restraining” SAC assets. “I’m not going to say what tomorrow may or may not bring,” he said. No Coincidence “When so many people from a single hedge fund have engaged in insider trading, it is not a coincidence,” Bharara said. “Today’s indictment is not just a narrative of names and numbers, it is more broadly an account of a firm with zero tolerance for low returns but seemingly tremendous tolerance for questionable conduct,” he said. “So SAC, over time, became a veritable magnet for market cheaters.” Some SAC investors have already indicated they want to take their money out. SAC may shed investors who lose confidence in the well-performing firm or the government may shut it down after a conviction or lawsuit loss or a settlement. Diehards may stay giving Cohen enough capital to continue, unless the government ends his hedge fund career. Deutsche Bank Banks including Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. were debating whether to suspend doing business with SAC, which has been one of Wall Street’s biggest trading clients, according to two people briefed on the matter. Spokespeople for the biggest Wall Street banks declined to comment on whether they had come to a decision. Institutional investors have already redeemed their money in the fund. Some SAC clients will probably keep their money where it is, said Don Steinbrugge, managing partner of Agecroft Partners LLC, a Richmond, Virginia-based firm that advises hedge funds and investors. “Each new allegation from the SEC will cause some investors to withdraw, however, there will be investors that stay with Steve Cohen to the bitter end,” he said. “Those investors who stay with Cohen have built strong loyalty toward him over time and also don’t see much downside.” Assets Managed SAC oversaw $6 billion for outsiders at the start of this year. Cohen has about $7.5 billion in SAC’s funds and employees account for $1.5 billion of assets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Cohen, 57, wasn't named in the criminal indictment, and faces no threat of time in a federal prison. Bharara has said he’s not aiming to put the firm out of business but that federal laws allow for monetary penalties for companies that break the law. SAC was charged with four counts of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud. Giving prosecutors a head start in proving their criminal case, the U.S. described separate insider trading schemes by at least eight former SAC fund managers and analysts, including Noah Freeman, Donald Longueuil, Jon Horvath, Wesley Wang, Mathew Martoma, Richard Choo-Beng Lee and Michael Steinberg. “This is a case about corporate conduct and corporate responsibility,” Federal Bureau of Investigation Assistant Director George Venizelos said in a statement. “SAC Capital and its management fostered a culture of permissiveness. SAC not only tolerated cheating, it encouraged it. Our aim all along has been to root out the wrongdoers, and send a message to anyone else inclined to break the law. If your information ’edge’ is inside information, you can’t trade on it.” An initial hearing in the case is scheduled for today before U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan. The case is U.S. v. SAC Capital Advisors LP, 13-00541, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Obama Holds 5-Point Edge Over Romney Among Likely Voters in Poll,['Greg Giroux'],2012-09-19 12:36:15,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/poll-gives-obama-5-point-edge-over-romney-among-likely-voters.html,"President Barack Obama leads Republican challenger Mitt Romney even as a majority of voters continues to disapprove of the president’s handling of the U.S. economy , according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Obama holds a five-point advantage over Romney, 50 percent to 45 percent, among likely voters in the nationwide survey conducted Sept. 12-16. Obama led Romney by 50 percent to 44 percent among registered voters in the poll released yesterday. The results reflect the small advantage Obama has enjoyed in some polls since the Democratic National Convention two weeks ago in Charlotte , North Carolina. Other surveys have shown the race tightening after a post-convention lift for Obama. The Gallup tracking poll gives Obama 47 percent support and Romney 46 percent in a rolling seven-day average through Sept. 17. Slideshow: A Gallery of Political Gaffes The NBC/Journal poll underscores the small share of voters who say they have yet to make a choice between Obama and Romney before the Nov. 6 election. In the survey, 3 percent said they were “not sure” who they would support, 1 percent answered “depends,” and 1 percent answered “neither/other.” Economy Question By 51 percent to 47 percent, registered voters disapproved rather than approved of Obama’s handling of the economy. Still, that’s the best showing for the president on that question in the survey since May 2010. And the figures are an improvement from last month when the poll showed 54 percent disapproving of his record on the economy and 44 percent approving. On Obama’s overall performance in office, 50 percent of registered voters approved in the latest poll; in August, that figure was 48 percent. Obama and Romney are tied at 43 percent on the question of who would be better at dealing with the economy.   Republican officials say 43 consecutive months of unemployment above 8 percent show that Obama’s policies have failed, while Democrats point to 30 straight months of private- sector job growth as evidence the president’s programs have helped pull the U.S. out of its worst recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s. On other issues, 49 percent of registered voters approve of Obama’s handling of foreign policy, down from 54 percent last month. The survey was conducted after Sept. 11 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic mission that led to the deaths of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans in Benghazi. Obama Advantages Poll respondents gave Obama double-digit advantages over Romney on who would be better in dealing with issues of concern to women, looking out for the middle class and handling Medicare. The survey was conducted before Mother Jones magazine posted excerpts of a leaked video from a May campaign fundraiser at which Romney described 47 percent of Americans as government- dependent “victims” who will vote for Obama “no matter what.” Romney last night told reporters his comments weren’t “elegantly stated,” even as he declined to disavow them. The poll’s sampling margin of error was plus or minus 3.3 percentage points for 900 registered voters and plus or minus 3.6 percentage points for 736 likely voters.

The Supposed Decline of Green Energy,['Andrew Winston'],2012-09-27 01:55:11,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/the-supposed-decline-of-green-energy.html,"Here's a surprising new fact about energy in the United States: the percentage of our electricity coming from the greenest sources — that is, the non-hydroelectric renewables such as solar, wind, geothermal and biomass — has doubled in just four years to nearly 6 percent. (Thanks to climate uberblogger Joe Romm for uncovering this data from the Energy Information Agency). This significant win for clean energy has gone mostly unnoticed in the press. If anything, the story has been the opposite: recent reports herald the decline of wind, and for a year the media has made a big deal out of the demise of solar panel manufacturer Solyndra. Given this negative drumbeat, it's not surprising that the business world tends to perceive renewable energy as an altruistic, rather than fiscally prudent, investment. But this view is dead wrong. The renewable energy industry is growing very fast... and not because it's a philanthropic effort. Let's look at the plight of solar panel manufacturers again. Every growing industry experiences painful shakeouts driven by rising competition. In the case of solar, vast investments in production capacity in China have quickly brought down the cost of panels — a jaw-dropping 65 percent slide in just 18 months. This is good news for people buying solar, but it's not great for many manufacturers. By lowering the ""China price,"" the world's low-cost manufacturer is doing to solar what it did to the apparel and electronics sectors: driving higher-cost producers (usually in the West) out of business. Aside from China's role specifically, all of this should look familiar to any students of business history. Adam Shor studies the solar sector for the Electric Power Research Institute. As he put it to me, ""Show me a mature industry with more than five big players."" In the most oft-cited parallel example, a century ago there were hundreds of car manufacturers. But all of this context misses a critical point that most businesspeople are overlooking: problems for manufacturers do not equal problems for the entire sector. Jigar Shah, a well-known clean tech entrepreneur and former CEO of the Carbon War Room, gave me this perspective: Solar cell manufacturers account for only three percent of the roughly 100,000 U.S. jobs in the solar sector. Another quarter make other components and the rest, making up a large, growing and local job base, work elsewhere in the value chain. Thus the fastest growing players are young companies that sell, install and service solar: soon-to-be household names like SunEdison (which Shah founded), SunRun, Sungevity, and SolarCity. In a lengthy article on these solar entrepreneurs, The New York Times recently reported that Sungevity, for example, has seen its revenues explode 16-fold in just two years. So back to this doubling of the share of electricity. Once technologies take off, doublings can happen pretty fast — just ask the investors in the Internet, mobile or social media. Will renewables' share double every 4 years? As Shah pointed out to me, the solar business is growing 30 percent per year (see the Solar Energy Industries Association site for general info in the U.S. solar market). Here's a math check: doubling every 4 years requires 19 percent annual growth. The power of exponential growth and economic tipping points work wonders: in just three more doublings in share, non-hydro renewables would provide nearly half of our electricity needs — more than we get from coal or natural gas today. The scale and pace of change I'm describing is not a fantasy — it has already happened elsewhere. Portugal transformed its electric grid from 17 percent renewables to 45 percent in just five years (as of 2010). And in the first half of 2012, renewables provided over 25 percent of Germany's electricity. On one sunny day this past May, Germany set a world record by generating 50 percent of its peak electricity needs solely from solar power. Shah predicts that next spring, the number will be closer to 70 percent. It was easy to write off renewable energy as a side show at one or two percent of total electricity generation. But it isn't good business to ignore it now, as the economics get better and better. Making the assumption that solar or all green energy won't work because one company didn't pan out is absurd. In 2000, were all technology investments poor bets because Pets.com went under? The cost of using renewable energy, either through power purchasing agreements that cost nothing up front or through direct investment, is dropping fast.

Andrew Winston is the co-author of the best-seller Green to Gold and the author of Green Recovery. He advises some of the world’s biggest companies on environmental strategy.",['Andrew Winston'],"The Supposed Decline of Green Energy Here's a surprising new fact about energy in the United States: the percentage of our electricity coming from the greenest sources — that is, the non-hydroelectric renewables such as solar, wind, geothermal and biomass — has doubled in just four years to nearly 6 percent. (Thanks to climate uberblogger Joe Romm for uncovering this data from the Energy Information Agency). This significant win for clean energy has gone mostly unnoticed in the press. If anything, the story has been the opposite: recent reports herald the decline of wind, and for a year the media has made a big deal out of the demise of solar panel manufacturer Solyndra. Given this negative drumbeat, it's not surprising that the business world tends to perceive renewable energy as an altruistic, rather than fiscally prudent, investment. But this view is dead wrong. The renewable energy industry is growing very fast... and not because it's a philanthropic effort. Let's look at the plight of solar panel manufacturers again. Every growing industry experiences painful shakeouts driven by rising competition. In the case of solar, vast investments in production capacity in China have quickly brought down the cost of panels — a jaw-dropping 65 percent slide in just 18 months. This is good news for people buying solar, but it's not great for many manufacturers. By lowering the ""China price,"" the world's low-cost manufacturer is doing to solar what it did to the apparel and electronics sectors: driving higher-cost producers (usually in the West) out of business. Aside from China's role specifically, all of this should look familiar to any students of business history. Adam Shor studies the solar sector for the Electric Power Research Institute. As he put it to me, ""Show me a mature industry with more than five big players."" In the most oft-cited parallel example, a century ago there were hundreds of car manufacturers. But all of this context misses a critical point that most businesspeople are overlooking: problems for manufacturers do not equal problems for the entire sector. Jigar Shah, a well-known clean tech entrepreneur and former CEO of the Carbon War Room, gave me this perspective: Solar cell manufacturers account for only three percent of the roughly 100,000 U.S. jobs in the solar sector. Another quarter make other components and the rest, making up a large, growing and local job base, work elsewhere in the value chain. Thus the fastest growing players are young companies that sell, install and service solar: soon-to-be household names like SunEdison (which Shah founded), SunRun, Sungevity, and SolarCity. In a lengthy article on these solar entrepreneurs, The New York Times recently reported that Sungevity, for example, has seen its revenues explode 16-fold in just two years. So back to this doubling of the share of electricity. Once technologies take off, doublings can happen pretty fast — just ask the investors in the Internet, mobile or social media. Will renewables' share double every 4 years? As Shah pointed out to me, the solar business is growing 30 percent per year (see the Solar Energy Industries Association site for general info in the U.S. solar market). Here's a math check: doubling every 4 years requires 19 percent annual growth. The power of exponential growth and economic tipping points work wonders: in just three more doublings in share, non-hydro renewables would provide nearly half of our electricity needs — more than we get from coal or natural gas today. The scale and pace of change I'm describing is not a fantasy — it has already happened elsewhere. Portugal transformed its electric grid from 17 percent renewables to 45 percent in just five years (as of 2010). And in the first half of 2012, renewables provided over 25 percent of Germany's electricity. On one sunny day this past May, Germany set a world record by generating 50 percent of its peak electricity needs solely from solar power. Shah predicts that next spring, the number will be closer to 70 percent. It was easy to write off renewable energy as a side show at one or two percent of total electricity generation. But it isn't good business to ignore it now, as the economics get better and better. Making the assumption that solar or all green energy won't work because one company didn't pan out is absurd. In 2000, were all technology investments poor bets because Pets.com went under? The cost of using renewable energy, either through power purchasing agreements that cost nothing up front or through direct investment, is dropping fast. This reality changes the calculus on green energy for homeowners, governments and corporations alike. Upfront costs are falling, which makes the ongoing variable cost of renewables — that is, zero — even more attractive. Better yet, zero is a predictable cost, which CFOs love. In recent years, several corporate energy managers have told me that when they run the numbers on renewables, the payback just isn't quick enough. I'd suggest running the numbers again.

"U.K. May Sell Lloyds on Buybacks, Dividend, Mediobanca Says",['Howard Mustoe'],2012-09-19 05:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/u-k-may-sell-lloyds-on-buybacks-dividend-mediobanca-says.html,"The U.K. government may sell its stake in Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) before its Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc holding through share buybacks and a special dividend, Mediobanca SpA analysts said. The government could be paid the dividend by London-based Lloyds from earnings over the next eight years, and the bank could buy some taxpayer-owned stock to minimize any loss on the bailout, the analysts, led by Christopher Wheeler , wrote in a note to clients today, initiating coverage of both banks. Shares in each bank are trading at just more than half what the government paid for them at the height of the financial crisis. RBS fell 2.7 percent to 267.1 pence, and Lloyds declined 2.5 percent to 38.9 pence yesterday. “The sale will have to satisfy political requirements as well as the usual market and commercial requirements,” the analysts wrote. “The sales of any of the stakes below entry price, even as a strategy of creating market tension ahead of sales at a higher price, will attract criticism in the media and from whichever party is in opposition.” Lloyds may be sold before RBS (RBS) because the government owns less of the bank, and the lender has said it will more quickly ring fence its consumer bank as recommended by the Independent Commission on Banking, Wheeler said. The U.K. bought its 82 percent stake in RBS for an average 502 pence a share, taking into account the Edinburgh-based bank’s recent reverse stock split, and bought Lloyds’s stock at 73.6 pence apiece for a 40 percent stake in 2008. Lloyds’s Profits Lloyds will have 18.5 billion pounds ($30 billion) of cash to distribute by 2020 from profits, less equity retained to meet new capital rules, in a base-case scenario, Wheeler estimated. The government invested 20.3 billion pounds when it bought its stake. Lloyds would need to seek shareholder approval to start buying back the stake from 2015, Wheeler said. The money could then be used to buy out RBS shareholders and fully nationalize that bank, which could speed up paying off the government’s 45.5 billion-pound investment, according to the note. The government could then start selling its stake in stages, he said. By 2020, RBS may have 27.2 billion pounds in capital to distribute under a base case, wrote Wheeler, who has an underperform rating on the bank and a target price of 253 pence for the end of fiscal year 2013. He rates Lloyds neutral, with a target price of 39 pence. The U.K. could start selling its stake in RBS at a loss, Jim O’Neil , chief executive officer of U.K. Financial Investments Ltd., the body that manages the government’s holding in the bank, told lawmakers on March 14.

"European Bonds Advance in Week, Buoyed by Central-Bank Optimism",['Emma Charlton'],2013-07-19 15:39:05,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/german-government-bonds-little-changed-as-producer-prices-stall.html,"All European government bonds rose this week on optimism central banks around the world will maintain stimulus measures that subdue interest rates. “There’s a feeling that policy makers will continue to intervene and create support for bonds,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “Core bonds will stay supported.” Ten-year Italian yields reached the lowest level in more than a week today after Interior Minister Angelino Alfano survived a no-confidence vote in the nation’s Senate. Portugal ’s 10-year bonds rose after President Anibal Cavaco Silva said he remained confident the nation could overcome political turmoil. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said he would press his European counterparts at a Group-of-20 meeting to spur growth. Italian 10-year yields were little changed at 4.41 percent at 4:18 p.m. London time, a decline of seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, in the week. The rate touched 4.36 percent, the lowest level since July 11. The price of the 4.5 percent bond due in May 2023 was 101.075. The two-day meeting of G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors started today, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke this week buoyed optimism that measures to restore growth will be maintained when he testified to U.S. lawmakers. The European Central Bank said yesterday it was looking at ways to boost lending to small- and medium-sized companies by revising its collateral rules. Italian Concern Germany ’s 10-year bund yield was little changed at 1.52 percent, after dropping to 1.50 percent, the lowest since June 7. The 10-year rate has fallen four basis points this week. The yield will drop to 1.40 percent in the next few weeks, Giansanti predicted. Italy’s two-year note yield dropped five basis points today to 1.60 percent on optimism the confidence vote will help overcome investor concern that Italy ’s ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Enrico Letta, is fraying. Letta won support yesterday from President Giorgio Napolitano, who urged disgruntled lawmakers to maintain backing for the government. Political instability could weaken Italian sovereign debt, raising borrowing costs, the 88-year-old head of state said. “The vote of no confidence in the Senate went OK and that’s a positive, which is helping the bonds,” said Owen Callan, an analyst at Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) in Dublin. “It’s an uncertainty that’s now out of the way.” Portuguese Negotiations Volatility on Finnish securities was the highest in euro-area markets today followed by those of Portugal and France , according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps. Portuguese bonds had their first weekly advance in nine weeks as talks continued between the nation’s ruling coalition parties and the main opposition Socialist Party. A fifth round of meetings yesterday failed to produce a deal on how to meet the terms demanded by a European Union-led bailout. “Things are going as expected,” Cavaco Silva said in comments broadcast by TVI television station yesterday. “I’m confident, but I’m not sure what the final outcome will be.” Portugal’s 10-year yield declined 20 basis points to 6.82 percent for a 69 basis-point drop this week. “Portugal is proving to be one of the more sensitive markets to domestic political events,” Citigroup Inc. strategist Peter Goves wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. “Although the full impact of the unfolding politics is unclear at this stage, such events do little to harness a perception of stability.” Italy’s bonds returned 2.6 percent this year through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German securities handed investors a loss of 0.6 percent, while Spanish bonds earned 6 percent.

Portugal ’s 10-year bonds rose after President Anibal Cavaco Silva said he remained confident the nation could overcome political turmoil. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said he would press his European counterparts at a Group-of-20 meeting to spur growth. Italian 10-year yields were little changed at 4.41 percent at 4:18 p.m. London time, a decline of seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, in the week. The rate touched 4.36 percent, the lowest level since July 11. The price of the 4.5 percent bond due in May 2023 was 101.075. The two-day meeting of G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors started today, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke this week buoyed optimism that measures to restore growth will be maintained when he testified to U.S. lawmakers. The European Central Bank said yesterday it was looking at ways to boost lending to small- and medium-sized companies by revising its collateral rules. Italian Concern Germany ’s 10-year bund yield was little changed at 1.52 percent, after dropping to 1.50 percent, the lowest since June 7. The 10-year rate has fallen four basis points this week. The yield will drop to 1.40 percent in the next few weeks, Giansanti predicted. Italy’s two-year note yield dropped five basis points today to 1.60 percent on optimism the confidence vote will help overcome investor concern that Italy ’s ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Enrico Letta, is fraying. Letta won support yesterday from President Giorgio Napolitano, who urged disgruntled lawmakers to maintain backing for the government.

Vodafone Chief Seeks Media Partners to Tackle Slowdown,['Amy Thomson' 'Jonathan Browning'],2012-11-12 08:35:40,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/vodafone-s-colao-seeks-media-partners-to-tackle-europe-slowdown.html,"Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , grappling with shrinking wireless revenue in European markets such as Spain and Italy , is courting new sales partners: television companies and newspaper publishers. Vodafone’s U.S. venture Verizon Wireless struck a deal this year to sell mobile-phone packages bundled with fixed-line, TV and Web offerings of cable operator Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) in each other’s stores. Vittorio Colao, Vodafone’s chief executive officer, wants to bring that kind of partnership to Europe, even if that means he’ll have to sign separate agreements in a dozen markets on the culturally and politically fragmented continent. “Can I have the equivalent of a Comcast-Verizon relationship in Europe?” Colao said over coffee at his company’s London offices in September. “Probably, but there will be lots of these types of relationships.” The push to find new European customers is of paramount importance for the 51-year-old as Vodafone generates more than two-thirds of revenue in a region that’s struggling with high sovereign debt and slow economic growth. Europe may have caused Vodafone’s service revenue to contract 0.7 percent in the fiscal second quarter that ended in September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the first decline in 10 quarters for the Newbury, England-based company, which is scheduled to report earnings tomorrow. The figure includes sales from voice, data, messaging and broadband services, and excludes the impact of currency swings and merger and acquisitions. African Profit Vodafone’s African business, Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) , said today its first-half profit rose 22 percent as the company expanded beyond South Africa. Shares of Vodafone climbed 0.2 percent to 167.95 pence in London trading at 8:32 a.m. The shares have lost 6.3 percent this year through Nov. 9, compared with a 9.8 percent decline by the 23-company Bloomberg Europe Telecommunication Services Index. The world’s second-largest mobile-phone company, trailing China Mobile Ltd. (941) in revenue, reported a 1.1 percent decline in organic service revenue for Europe in the year through March 2012, while sales grew 8 percent in Asia , Africa and the Middle East and 7.3 percent at Verizon Wireless, in which Vodafone owns 45 percent. Distribution Deals The agreement with Comcast allows Verizon to offer customers Internet access across the U.S. without having to expand its own fiber-based service, which cost the company $23 billion over seven years to build. While Verizon sells its own TV and high-speed Internet services in some regions of the U.S., there’s only a 15 percent overlap with the territory of Comcast, the country’s biggest cable company. The deal has turned a potential adversary of Vodafone into a partner across the U.S. and a replication in Europe would make sense, says Robin Bienenstock , an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein in London. Phone and broadband companies could benefit from distribution agreements with media companies as customers increasingly demand access to their favorite magazines, movies and television shows on mobile devices. Vodafone is in talks to replicate a content deal it has in Italy -- where it distributes the La Repubblica newspaper on a mobile platform -- in the U.K. market, Colao said. France Telecom SA (FTE) partnered with each of the local units of RTL Group SA, Europe’s biggest broadcaster with 47 channels in nine countries, in order to win the rights to distribute the Groupe M6 TV channel in France and three other channels in Belgium. Local Idols “People in Germany want to see the German version of the Idol series, not the U.K. one,” said Oliver Fahlbusch, a spokesman for RTL, whose FremantleMedia content-production arm has produced hit shows such as “The X Factor” and “Good Times, Bad Times.” BT Group Plc (BT\) this year acquired rights for top-flight English soccer and rugby matches, which were traditionally the preserve of pay-TV operators, and is building its own television channel to sell more broadband subscriptions. Purchasing content is a risky step for phone companies as they don’t have experience in running media businesses, said IHS Screen Digest analyst Tim Westcott. Missed Opportunity One missed opportunity for Vodafone was a pan-European pay-TV operator across Sky TV’s platform. News Corp ., which owns 39 percent of British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) , had planned to create a pan-European broadcaster made up of its Sky operations in the U.K., Italy and Germany. A phone-hacking scandal at News Corp.’s British newspapers then prompted the company last year to drop its 7.8 billion-pound ($12.4 billion) bid for the rest of BSkyB. To be sure, Vodafone isn’t prepared to enter the complicated world of regional TV rights, says Colao, a former McKinsey & Co. partner and a cyclist who watched part of this year’s Tour de France on his iPad. “I don’t believe that we need to get involved into content ourselves, but we need probably to help distribute the content ourselves,” Colao told analysts in July. “It’s about liberating usage and ensuring a good experience.” To contact the reporters on this story: Amy Thomson in London at athomson6@bloomberg.net ; Jonathan Browning in London at jbrowning9@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net",['Amy ThomsonJonathan Browning'],"Vodafone Chief Seeks Media Partners to Tackle Slowdown Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , grappling with shrinking wireless revenue in European markets such as Spain and Italy , is courting new sales partners: television companies and newspaper publishers.

Cnooc Said to Send Term Sheet to Banks for $6 Billion Nexen Loan,['Katrina Nicholas'],2012-09-26 04:25:05,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/cnooc-said-to-send-term-sheet-to-banks-for-6-billion-nexen-loan.html,"Cnooc Ltd.

Citigroup Inc. is Cnooc’s financial adviser, the person said. The Beijing-based company agreed to pay $15.1 billion in cash in July to acquire Nexen.

Cnooc is offering to pay an upfront 25 basis-point fee for the 12-month facility with no limits on commitment size, the person said, citing details from the term sheet.

Consumer Bureau Nomination Goes to Senate,['Carter Dougherty'],2011-10-06 18:25:57,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/consumer-bureau-nominee-approved-by-senate-banking-committee.html,"Richard Cordray ’s selection to lead the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was approved by the Senate Banking Committee in a move that sets up a showdown with Republicans vowing to block any nominee for the post. Today’s 12-10 vote sends the nomination to the full Senate, where 44 Republicans have pledged to deny confirmation for anyone to serve as director until changes are made in the structure and funding of the new agency created by the Dodd- Frank Act. That opposition would block confirmation by the 100- member Senate, which would require at least 60 votes. “My colleagues and I stand by our pledge that no nominee to head the CFPB will be confirmed by the U.S. Senate -- regardless of party affiliation -- without basic changes to the Bureau’s structure,” Senator Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement today. Cordray, the former Ohio attorney general now serving as the consumer bureau’s enforcement chief, was nominated by President Barack Obama in July. Republican lawmakers are seeking changes including replacing the director position with a five- member board and making the bureau’s budget subject to the congressional appropriations process. If the Senate fails to confirm a consumer bureau director, it will “leave a vast array of non-bank financial institutions, consumer finance companies, outside the scope of consumer financial protection, which was exactly the same mistake that left us vulnerable to the financial crisis that we went through,” Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner told the Senate panel in a hearing after the vote on Cordray. ‘Every Inch’ The consumer bureau, which officially began work on July 21, won’t assume full supervisory powers over non-bank financial firms until a director is in place. Republicans “want to roll back the whole notion of having a consumer watchdog,” Obama said today at a news conference. “I’m going to be fighting every inch of the way here in Washington to make sure that we have a consumer watchdog,” he said. Obama tied the need for a strong consumer agency to the recent decision by Bank of America Corp. (BAC) to impose a $5 monthly fee on some customers for debit-card use. The fee came shortly after rules took effect limiting the “swipe” fees banks can charge retailers when customers use debit cards. “People have been using financial regulation as an excuse to charge consumers more,” Obama said. The president said that while the bureau’s role is not to dictate profitability it is “entirely appropriate for the government to have some oversight role” on behalf of consumers. “My main goal is to make sure that we’ve got a consumer watchdog in place who is letting consumers know what fair practices are, making sure that transactions are transparent, and making sure that banks have to compete for customers based on the quality of their service and good prices,” Obama said.

Russia’s Grain Imports Seen Rising to More Than 2 Million Tons,['Marina Sysoyeva'],2012-11-15 12:30:47,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/russia-s-grain-imports-seen-rising-to-more-than-2-million-tons.html,"Russia , the world’s third-biggest wheat exporter last season, will need to import more than 2 million metric tons of feed grain this season after drought seared crops, the country’s Grain Producers’ Union said. That compares with its estimate of about 2 million tons on Nov. 1. The country usually imports about 800,000 tons of feed grain, according to the union data. “Farmers will have to choose between slaughtering livestock or feeding it with seed grain in January,” Pavel Skurikhin, the union president, said in an e-mailed statement today. The Agriculture Ministry downgraded its grain crop forecast yesterday to 71 million tons from October’s 71.7 million tons. That compares with 94.2 million tons harvested in 2011, according to its data. Arkady Zlochevsky, Russia’s Grain Union president, said yesterday that elevated cereal prices this year will leave farmers with enough funds to buy high-quality seeds and fertilizers and harvest more than 100 million tons if there’s favorable weather in the coming season. Skurikhin said high grain prices now won’t necessarily be enough for a successful sowing campaign, “because farms will physically have nothing to sell” later this season. The government’s plans to increase the capital of the Russian Agricultural bank, known as Rosselkhozbank (RSHB) , by as much as 40 billion rubles ($1.26 billion) will allow more lending to farms and may improve the sowing and next year’s crop prospects, Skurikhin said. Wheat for December delivery rose 0.6 percent to $8.69 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 4:27 p.m. in Moscow. It’s advanced 33 percent this year.

End to Space Suits Over Astronauts’ Souvenirs Under Bill,['Brian Faler'],2012-09-20 13:36:21,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/apollo-astronauts-could-keep-nasa-souvenirs-under-house-bill.html,"Call it the Edgar Mitchell bill. The U.S. House has approved legislation that would grant astronauts of the Apollo era and earlier the right to keep crew patches, flashlights and a lot of other souvenirs from their historic missions. The mementos have become the subject of a heated battle between astronauts and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which would rather see many of the items --which can command six-figure prices from private collectors --in a museum. The astronauts were told long ago by NASA that they could keep the memorabilia, only to find the agency demanding their return decades later, according to the bill’s sponsors. “This stuff had been properly given to us and who are these young jerks, excuse the word, 40 years later saying you can’t have this stuff,” said Mitchell, who flew on Apollo 14 and was the sixth man to walk on the moon. “All of the astronaut corps was up in arms,” he said yesterday in a telephone interview. Mitchell said NASA sued him over a camera that he salvaged after his 1971 mission to the moon. The astronauts-rights bill now heads to the Senate for consideration. Big Money NASA Spokesman Bob Jacobs declined to comment. Agency administrator Charles Bolden said in January there had been “fundamental misunderstandings and unclear policies” over who owned what. The agency would search for a solution that would “ensure that appropriate artifacts are preserved and available for display to the American people,” he said in a press release. Space memorabilia can fetch thousands from collectors. In 2009, a plastic disc-shaped star chart used by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on their 1969 Apollo 11 moonwalk went for $218,000. Mitchell agreed to give up his disputed camera, which he said he retrieved from a lunar module that was to be destroyed, rather than battle the government in court. It went to the Smithsonian Institution’s Air and Space Museum in Washington. “It really wasn’t worth spending a year in court and $100,000” in legal expenses, he said. The bill, approved on a voice vote, declares that the government has no right to items that aren’t explicitly required to be returned to NASA and “other expendable, disposable and personal-use items.” Moon Rocks That may include personal logs, checklists, flight manuals and other items. It wouldn’t apply to moon rocks and other lunar material. “These men are heroes,” said Science, Space and Technology Committee Chairman Ralph Hall, the Texas Republican who sponsored the bill. “They took extraordinary risks to establish American preeminence in space, and by doing so helped our country become a world leader,” said Hall. “It is a miscarriage of justice that today NASA should seek return of these very same mementos.” The bill, H.R. 4158, would apply to Apollo, Gemini and Mercury crews.

Ciris Gets Asia Pacific Backing to Convert Coal to Gas,['Andrew Herndon'],2013-07-26 23:40:13,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/ciris-gets-asia-pacific-capital-backing-to-convert-coal-to-gas.html,"Ciris Energy Inc., a closely held U.S. company that converts coal to natural gas, raised $15 million from Asia Pacific Capital of Hong Kong in a Series C funding round to commercialize its technology. The preferred stock offering follows a similar, $10 million investment in February from Asia Pacific Capital, Ciris said today in a statement. The company developed a technique to inject nutrients into buried coal-seams to stimulate naturally occurring microorganisms that consume coal and emit methane. The process converts low-rank coal into more valuable products such as methane and industrial chemicals, according to Centennial, Colorado-based Ciris’s website. Ciris is developing an underground project in Wyoming ’s Powder River Basin and plans to demonstrate next year a process it’s developing that works above ground, after coal is mined, Chief Executive Officer Jay Short said in an interview. He’s evaluating additional project opportunities in the U.S., Australia and Asia , including China and Indonesia. Asia has “major challenges in terms of dealing with coal, and they need new energy sources,” Short said. Low-rank coals, such as those present in Wyoming, emit more pollutants when burned, he said. “There’s a large advantage to converting them instead to natural gas. It’s much cleaner.” Ciris expects that a project producing gas from a 640-acre coal-seam may last for 20 years and generate as much as $250 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Short said. Its 160-acre project in Wyoming will begin commercial production next year, he said. The company also is backed by ConocoPhillips (COP) , Braemar Energy Ventures, Rho Ventures LLC, Triplepoint Capital LLC, Lighthouse Capital Partners Inc., Khosla Ventures and Energy Technology Ventures.

Givaudan SA led gains in the index. Belimo Holding AG (BEAN) rose 4.8 percent after it forecast continued growth in Europe. Actelion Ltd fell the most on the benchmark index. Kuehne & Nagel International AG dropped 1 percent after the shares were downgraded at Nomura Holdings Inc. The SMI added 0.2 percent to 7,758.65 at the close of trading in Zurich, its highest level since May 2008. The SMI rallied 1.9 percent last week as the U.S. unemployment rate fell and speculation mounted that central banks around the world will continue to support economic recovery.

The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies was 30 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. German exports rose more than economists forecast in January, data from the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden showed. Exports, adjusted for working days and seasonal changes, advanced 1.4 percent from December, when they gained 0.2 percent. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had forecast a 0.5 increase. Italy Rating Fitch Ratings downgraded Italy ’s credit rating by one level to BBB+ with a negative outlook amid a political deadlock that threatens the country’s ability to respond to a recession and the debt crisis.

Full-year net income rose 19 percent to 61.4 million francs as sales rose 6.9 percent to 444.6 million francs ($468 million), Belimo said. The company is proposing a dividend of 60 francs a share, an increase of 10 francs from a year earlier.

The broader Swiss Performance Index rose 0.1 percent today. The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies was 30 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. German exports rose more than economists forecast in January, data from the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden showed. Exports, adjusted for working days and seasonal changes, advanced 1.4 percent from December, when they gained 0.2 percent. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had forecast a 0.5 increase. Italy Rating Fitch Ratings downgraded Italy ’s credit rating by one level to BBB+ with a negative outlook amid a political deadlock that threatens the country’s ability to respond to a recession and the debt crisis. Givaudan, the world’s largest maker of flavorings and fragrances, advanced 0.9 percent to 1,175 francs. Belimo Holding rose 4.8 percent to 2,096 francs after the Swiss maker of air conditioning machinery forecast continued growth in Europe, its biggest market. Full-year net income rose 19 percent to 61.4 million francs as sales rose 6.9 percent to 444.6 million francs ($468 million), Belimo said. The company is proposing a dividend of 60 francs a share, an increase of 10 francs from a year earlier. Nestle SA, the world’s largest food company which accounts for more than 23 percent of the SMI, added 0.5 percent to 67.65 francs. Kuehne & Nagel (KNIN) , the world’s biggest sea-freight forwarder, dropped 1 percent to 104.50 francs. The stock was downgraded to neutral from buy at Nomura. Actelion, the Swiss maker of the Tracleer lung drug, fell 0.8 percent to 50.55 francs, snapping a four-day rally.

Coal Era Beckons for Europe as Carbon Giveaway Finishes,['Mathew Carr'],2012-09-21 19:16:40,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/coal-era-beckons-for-europe-as-carbon-giveaway-finishes.html,"European utilities are poised to add more coal-fired power capacity than natural gas in the next four years, boosting emissions just as the era of free carbon permits ends. Power producers from EON AG to RWE AG (RWE) will open six times more coal-burning plants than gas-fed units by 2015, UBS AG said in a Sept. 5 research note. Profits at coal-fired power stations may more than double by then, according to a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. report published on Sept. 13. The new stations, replacing atomic and aging fossil fuel- based plants, will boost demand for emission permits because coal-fired generators need twice as many credits as gas users under climate protection rules. The price of UN credits may rebound 73 percent by the end of next year from an all-time low on Sept. 18, according to the Euro Carbon Macro Fund in Luxembourg, which manages about $32 million. “The economics for coal are near the best we’ve seen in five years,” Laurent Segalen, a director at ECMF, said yesterday in an interview from London. Buying UN credits for 2013, after they plunged almost 80 percent in the past year, is “an amazing bargain,” he said. UN offsets, known as Certified Emission Reductions, for next year had their biggest weekly decline through Sept. 14, losing 29 percent of their value. Credits for delivery in 2013 gained 1.9 percent today to 2.10 euros ($2.73) a metric ton, on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. European Union permits for next year fell 2.9 percent to 7.46 euros. World’s Biggest Carbon is falling as the European Commission seeks to fix a glut of permits through 2020 in the world’s biggest greenhouse- gas market by traded volume. This year’s supplies have been inflated by credits that the European regulator has banned and need to be handed in by emitters before May. “The outlook for CERs will improve in the second half of next year,” Matthew Gray , an analyst and trader at Jefferies Group Inc. in London, said by phone Sept. 19. Prices may rise to 2.25 euros by December 2013, he said. CERs will probably climb to 3 euros in the same period, said Segalen, whose fund has gained 18 percent since its inception in January last year. They may struggle to rise above that, Trevor Sikorski , a director of European energy markets research at Barclays Plc in London, said yesterday by phone. Utilities will add as much as 10,600 megawatts of new coal plants in seven central European countries in the next four years, compared with 1,600 megawatts of new natural-gas capacity, Patrick Hummel, a UBS analyst in Zurich, said in the report. Generators will retire 3,400 megawatts of stations burning coal in the same period, he said. A thousand megawatts can supply power to about 2 million European homes. Boom Years “The buildout has nothing to do with low carbon prices,” Hummel said by e-mail on Sept. 14. “All these projects were already decided and kicked off several years ago, during the boom years of the utilities sector.” The next-year German power price, the regional benchmark, has fallen 47 percent since exceeding 90 euros a megawatt-hour in July 2008, according to broker prices compiled by Bloomberg. It closed at 48.11 euros yesterday. Coal plants can boost profit 58 percent by using UN offsets instead of EU permits for as much as 20 percent their compliance needs, according to a Bloomberg clean-dark spread calculator, which takes the cost of the fuel, power and carbon into account. German profits based on prices for next year will reach 15.69 euros a megawatt-hour with a CER, compared with 9.96 euros using an EU permit. Stations burning natural gas make a loss under both scenarios, the calculations show. Goldman Sachs Northwest Europe’s coal-fed capacity will rise 4.6 percent next year to 68,000 megawatts and 3 percent to the same level for gas-fired power stations, Deborah Wilkens, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in London, said in the report last week. Capacity will drop after 2013 for both fuels and margins at coal-fired plants may rise as high as 26 euros by 2015, she said. UBS’s estimates for new coal plants show that Connie Hedegaard , Europe’s climate commissioner, needs to succeed in her attempt to fix the glut in the region’s cap-and-trade system to protect the reputation of carbon markets, Mark Owen-Lloyd, a trader at Leap Trading Ltd. in London and formerly at EON, said on Sept. 11 by phone. Hedegaard in July proposed to withhold an unspecified amount of carbon permits temporarily from auctions planned in the three years starting in 2013. They would be returned to the market later this decade. “The worry is her plan to delay supply will merely move the problem to five years down the track,” Owen-Lloyd said. Isaac Valero-Ladron, a spokesman for Hedegaard, did not immediately comment.

Almost 40 percent of 150 venture capital firms that responded to the survey have decreased their investment in life sciences during the past three years, the National Venture Capital Association said today in a statement. The same proportion expect to continue to reduce their spending on these companies over the next three years, a potential $500 million loss, the association said. “The process has gotten to be so long, and the capital required so deep, that it’s becoming more and more difficult to generate venture-type returns and therefore make it worth your while to do it,” said Terry McGuire, co-founder and general partner of Polaris Venture Partners and past chairman of the association, in an interview.

Women Democratic Surge Creates Congressional Gender Gap,['Kathleen Hunter' 'Jonathan D.Salant'],2012-11-15 16:11:58,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/women-democratic-surge-creates-congressional-gender-gap.html,"The gender gap that emerged among voters during the presidential election is manifesting itself in a new way: inside Congress. The incoming Senate will have four times as many female Democrats compared with their Republican counterparts -- 16 to 4 -- and the imbalance will be almost 3 to 1 among female House members, 58 to 20. The public portrait of the two parties diverged further yesterday when Senate Republicans elected a man to fill the only vacancy in their all-male leadership. The only woman in the House Republicans’ top leadership, conference chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, defeated a challenge by Representative Tom Price of Georgia, who was backed by Representative Paul Ryan , the vice-presidential nominee from Wisconsin. On the Democratic side, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California announced yesterday that she would stay on for another two-year term. Pelosi served as the first and only woman speaker from 2007-2011. Senate Democrats re-elected their only female member of leadership -- Patty Murray of Washington -- as the fourth-ranking party official. Pelosi to Remain as U.S. House Minority Leader “Republicans have become extraordinarily out of touch with women, particularly women who are employed outside the home,” said Jean Schroedel, a professor in the Department of Politics and Policy at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California. Year of Woman Since 1992, the so-called “Year of the Woman” when a wave of female candidates were elected to public office, “Democrats had to pay attention to women in a way they never had to before,” Schroedel said. In subsequent years they made disproportionate gains in electing women to office. Pelosi emphasized the gender gap at a news conference yesterday where, surrounded by dozens of her female colleagues, she said she decided against giving up her leadership role just as congressional leaders begin negotiating a possible deal to avert automatic tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect Jan. 1. “For some people in the general public, the thought of four men at that table was not an appealing sight, however excellent they might be,” Pelosi said. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who is up for re-election in 2014, said the leadership elections may make it harder for her party to improve its standing with women voters, which should be a top priority. More Than Half “After all, women make up more than half of the electorate, and it was evident as I campaigned for some of my colleagues that the Democrats had been successful -- unfairly in my view -- in painting my party as somehow anti-women,” she said. “It does not help us correct that totally erroneous impression that we do not have women in leadership positions in the Senate and have only one woman in the House.” Women voters, 53 percent of the electorate, backed President Barack Obama over Republican nominee Mitt Romney , 55 percent to 44 percent, according to exit polls. The number of Democratic women in the Senate and House increased, while Republican women in both chambers declined. Among the outside groups that engaged in the election, Emily’s List, a group that supports Democratic female candidates who support abortion rights, was among the most successful after 80 percent of its endorsed House and Senate candidates won. Democratic States Democrats were well-positioned to send more women to the Senate because they nominated women in states that lean Democratic. Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, Mazie Hirono in Hawaii, and Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts all won comfortably in states that voted for Obama. Another advantage for Democrats: they will have about 500 more female state legislators than the Republicans next year, providing a deeper bench from which to recruit experienced candidates. “It’s important women be at all the tables,” said Representative Carolyn Maloney , a New York Democrat, because they’re usually the primary caregivers and are more focused on issues such as health care, education, children and families. Senator Claire McCaskill , a Missouri Democrat who just won re-election, said that she has already talked with Republicans Collins and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire to see if there are issues they can work together on. “We don’t revel in the conflict,” McCaskill said. Voice on Issues Ayotte said yesterday in an interview the lack of women in Senate Republican leadership ranks hasn’t kept her from having a voice on issues such as Republicans’ push to make sure suspected terrorists are tried in military rather than civilian courts. “It’s more important how our opinions are sought, and that they are respected, than just optics on these issues,” Ayotte said. A third benefit for Democrats, said Stephanie Schriock , president of Emily’s List, is that women in the party “bring their own life experiences” to the public forum. During the House debate in February 2011 to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides health services to women, Representative Jackie Speier , a California Democrat, defended the organization by talking about her own abortion. Representative Gwen Moore , a Wisconsin Democrat, said during a debate on reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act in March that she was the victim of rape and domestic abuse. Republican Resonance Ayotte said Republicans’ call for fiscal responsibility and economic growth resonates with women voters. “Women in families often handle the finances, and see up close the impact Washington has on them,” she said. Ayotte said that while she would like to see more Republican women elected to Congress, there are other prominent women in the party, such as Governors Susana Martinez of New Mexico and Nikki Haley of South Carolina. Republicans worsened the electorate’s gender gap in part because of comments by male candidates that offended female voters, including questioning what is “legitimate rape.” “It’s not that the Republican Party has always been anti- woman, it’s just that in this election, it made it seem that way,” said Linda Young, president of the National Women’s Political Caucus, which endorses women candidates of both parties who support abortion rights.

Another advantage for Democrats: they will have about 500 more female state legislators than the Republicans next year, providing a deeper bench from which to recruit experienced candidates. “It’s important women be at all the tables,” said Representative Carolyn Maloney , a New York Democrat, because they’re usually the primary caregivers and are more focused on issues such as health care, education, children and families. Senator Claire McCaskill , a Missouri Democrat who just won re-election, said that she has already talked with Republicans Collins and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire to see if there are issues they can work together on. “We don’t revel in the conflict,” McCaskill said. Voice on Issues Ayotte said yesterday in an interview the lack of women in Senate Republican leadership ranks hasn’t kept her from having a voice on issues such as Republicans’ push to make sure suspected terrorists are tried in military rather than civilian courts. “It’s more important how our opinions are sought, and that they are respected, than just optics on these issues,” Ayotte said. A third benefit for Democrats, said Stephanie Schriock , president of Emily’s List, is that women in the party “bring their own life experiences” to the public forum. During the House debate in February 2011 to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides health services to women, Representative Jackie Speier , a California Democrat, defended the organization by talking about her own abortion. Representative Gwen Moore , a Wisconsin Democrat, said during a debate on reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act in March that she was the victim of rape and domestic abuse. Republican Resonance Ayotte said Republicans’ call for fiscal responsibility and economic growth resonates with women voters. “Women in families often handle the finances, and see up close the impact Washington has on them,” she said. Ayotte said that while she would like to see more Republican women elected to Congress, there are other prominent women in the party, such as Governors Susana Martinez of New Mexico and Nikki Haley of South Carolina. Republicans worsened the electorate’s gender gap in part because of comments by male candidates that offended female voters, including questioning what is “legitimate rape.” “It’s not that the Republican Party has always been anti- woman, it’s just that in this election, it made it seem that way,” said Linda Young, president of the National Women’s Political Caucus, which endorses women candidates of both parties who support abortion rights.

Chinese Police Detain Distributor in Hero Milk Powder Probe,['Bloomberg News'],2013-03-29 22:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-29/shanghai-pulls-swiss-brand-s-milk-in-crackdown-after-apple-vw.html,"Chinese police detained a milk distributor suspected of repackaging and selling milk powder made by Swiss dairy company Hero Group that wasn’t licensed for sale domestically, the official Xinhua News Agency said. The suspect was in charge of a Suzhou, eastern China-based company distributing Hero-branded products, Xinhua said yesterday. Of the 17 batches of milk powder confiscated from the distributor, only three were qualified for sale in China , the agency said, without being more specific. Shanghai had asked 15 supermarkets and 28 stores selling Hero’s Nutradefense formula to remove the products after the state television broadcaster reported food quality problems, the city’s food safety commission said in a statement March 28. Lenzburg, Switzerland-based Hero said in a statement on its website yesterday it hasn’t detected any quality or safety problems with its products. Hero’s experience mirrors incidents that affected other overseas brands as China strengthens scrutiny on foreign companies ranging from iPhone maker Apple Inc. (AAPL) to Volkswagen AG. (VOW) New leadership takes over this month in a once-in-a-decade change and Premier Li Keqiang pledged on March 17 to improve consumer safety by regulating food quality and environmental protection with an “iron fist.” Yum, Audi Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) Vice Chairman Sam Su earlier this year apologized after Shanghai’s food safety commission found excessive levels of antibiotics in samples from a local chicken supplier between 2010 and 2011. Inspection processes and internal communications were lacking, said Su, who’s also chairman of the Louisville, Kentucky-based restaurant chain’s China business. Last year, Volkswagen’s luxury Audi unit asked a Chinese dealer to remove a banner advocating the murder of Japanese people after a photograph of the sign spread on the Internet amid escalating tensions between the two countries over disputed islands. The message didn’t reflect Audi’s views, Lu Minjie, a spokeswoman at FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Co. said in September. The Shanghai Food and Drug Administration is conducting a “through investigation” into Hero’s milk powder, the agency said in the statement on its website dated March 28. Any offenders would be “severely dealt with,” it said. Netherlands Made Hero said its infant formula sold in China is produced exclusively in the Netherlands and it hasn’t detected quality or safety violations. CCTV in a March 29 report said samples of Hero’s Nutradefense branded formula had altered expiration dates and were adulterated with expired milk. Hero Nutradefense infant formula is suitable for babies between 6 months to 3 years old, and it sells other infant nutrition brands such as Hero Baby, Friso, and Semper, globally, according to the company’s website. The Swiss dairy company said in the statement a recent investigation by the Suzhou Institute of Supervision & Inspection on Product Quality alleged that one of Hero’s sub- distributors in China had been involved in the illegal repackaging of Nutradefense. This has been investigated by Suzhou authorities and dealt with appropriately, it said. Apple and Volkswagen were featured in government-run China Central Television ’s annual consumer rights show in the country on March 15. Apple Criticism Apple has also come under criticism in China since CCTV’s annual consumer rights telecast two weeks ago found issues related to its after-sales service. The People’s Daily, a newspaper published by China’s Communist Party, has run articles critical of Apple every day this week. In yesterday’s People’s Daily, the newspaper said the State Administration for Industry and Commerce urged strengthening regulation of contracts between consumers and electronics makers. Apple policies on returns and repairs in China “fully comply with the local laws and regulations,” according to a Chinese-language statement that the company posted to consumers on its website last weekend. Volkswagen, Europe ’s largest automaker, said March 16 it plans to recall vehicles in China after drawing scrutiny from the nation’s quality inspector and state broadcaster over defective gearbox systems. Chinese owners of Volkswagen vehicles fitted with its direct-shift gearbox technology -- a system with two gearboxes that help enhance gear changes and improve fuel economy -- have reported abnormal vibrations, loss of power and sudden acceleration, according to CCTV’s report.

Wal-Mart Bets on Japan’s Falling Incomes in Soft Economy: Retail,['Yuki Yamaguchi'],2012-11-15 23:27:05,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/wal-mart-bets-on-japan-s-falling-incomes-in-soft-economy-retail.html,"Keikichi Miyakawa says he earned about $50,000 a month selling golf club memberships during Japan ’s bubble economy in the late 1980s. Now on a pension, the 65-year-old Tokyo resident shops at Seiyu, the discount chain owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) He recently bought packs of bean sprouts for 29 yen (36 cents), and croquettes for 49 yen (60 cents), sold as part of the store’s Mainichi Kakaku Yasuku strategy. That’s the Japanese translation of Wal-Mart’s “every day low prices” slogan. With Japan’s economy on the cusp of a third recession since 2008 and household incomes falling for the last three years, the country’s famously picky and brand-enamored shoppers are in a bargain-hunting mood. Discount stores are gaining and Wal-Mart, after years of mixed results and a 20.9 billion-yen loss for Seiyu in 2007, is expanding for the first time since 2008. Wal-Mart’s Japan business saw net sales rise 2 percent during the second quarter. Its Seiyu unit, which it has owned outright since 2008, will open seven new stores this year and three more in 2013. Wal-Mart’s head of international business, Doug McMillon, has said the company will even consider acquisitions to increase its presence in Japan. Low-Price Operation Wal-Mart faces hurdles in other parts of Asia : In China it’s adding fewer stores than previously planned, and its strategy in India has been stymied by regulations that until September banned foreign companies from investing in supermarkets. The American retailer is far more enthusiastic about Japan even as European rivals give up. In June, Britain’s Tesco Plc (TSCO) agreed to sell its business to Japan’s Aeon Co. (8267) France’s Carrefour SA (CA) left in 2005. With Japanese family budgets under stress, Wal-Mart’s “every day low-price operation is taking root,” says Takayuki Kito, a consultant in Tokyo with Munich-based Roland Berger Strategy Consultants. Price Battles By spending less on promotional fliers, Seiyu cut the chain’s advertising expenses by 45 percent from 2008 to 2011, according to Ryo Kanayama, an executive at Wal-Mart Japan. “They have gotten rid of a lot of the middlemen and managed to go more direct to consumers,” says David Strasser , an analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott. Other foreign retailers such as Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) and Ikea Group are also expanding in Japan. Local retailers are catching the discounting wave, too. Supermarket chain Aeon said in June that it will lower the price of 1,000 items, while rival Daiei Inc. (8263) will reduce prices for an additional 2,000 items beginning Nov. 17. Seiyu has pledged to cut the price of 2,300 items by the end of December. All this is great news for Japanese consumers. “Our monthly budget is now 70,000 yen for the expense for food and eating out. It was about 100,000 yen a couple of years ago,” says Aki Yamada, a 29-year-old housewife shopping at a Seiyu store in southern Tokyo. “The cheaper, the better.” To contact the reporter on this story: Yuki Yamaguchi in Tokyo at  yyamaguchi10@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephanie Wong at  swong139@bloomberg.net",['Yuki Yamaguchi'],"Wal-Mart Bets on Japan’s Falling Incomes in Soft Economy: Retail Keikichi Miyakawa says he earned about $50,000 a month selling golf club memberships during Japan ’s bubble economy in the late 1980s.

Baghdad Broker Dodges Bombs to Rack Up Stock Trades,['Zijing Wu'],2012-11-15 22:00:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/broker-shwan-taha-dominates-foreign-trades-at-iraq-stock.html,"It was exceptionally cold in Sulaymaniyah, a city in northern Iraq ’s Kurdish region, on the morning of Dec. 22. Shwan Taha was sitting in the airport lounge with a bag of gifts, waiting to get back to his wife and children at home in Istanbul. Just before boarding, he got a call on his mobile phone from Rabee Securities, the Baghdad-based brokerage he owns, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its December issue. The manager was on the line to report that a car bomb had exploded next door at the government anti-corruption agency. More from the December 2012 issue of Bloomberg Markets: Taha hung up. Fortunately, the last trading day of the year had been two days earlier, so none of Rabee’s 16 employees were in the office. He tapped out an e-mail to Rabee’s clients that said in part: “All client information is safe in multiple locations inside and outside Iraq. Praying for a peaceful New Year.” Recalling his firm’s brush with danger six months later, Taha says such incidents are a hazard of doing business -- and making money -- in one of the world’s most dangerous frontier markets. “I’ve always told people the major risk of running Rabee is, one day it may blow up, not Lehman style but physically,” Taha says, spreading both arms to suggest an explosion. “What can you do?” Biggest Brokerage Taha, who’s 6 foot 2 inches (1.88 meters) tall and has dark curly hair, is sitting in his office in Istanbul, where he spends a third of his time. The 43-year-old smiles and points to his iPhone case emblazoned with a morale-boosting exhortation made famous by a World War II-era poster in the U.K.: “Keep calm and carry on.” That’s what Taha has had to do for years as chairman and sole owner of the biggest stock brokerage tailored to foreign investors in postwar Iraq. Born in Baghdad to Kurdish parents and raised in the city, he bought Rabee for a small, undisclosed sum in 1998 to handle his personal trades in Iraqi stocks. It now handles about 80 percent of all share transactions by foreigners on the Iraq Stock Exchange (ISX), says Taha, whose selling point to his clients is that he’s an Iraqi with a decade of experience working at different times for investors Mark Mobius and George Soros. Other Baghdad brokers deal mostly with Iraqi clients. ‘Smart Money’ “Rabee stands out from all Iraqi brokers because Shwan understands how things work with Western investors,” says Geoffrey Batt, a partner at New York-based Euphrates Advisors LLC, an Iraq-focused hedge fund with about $27 million under management. Taha estimates Rabee has funneled about $200 million in investments through the ISX since 2008, when the brokerage began attracting non-Iraqi investors. A broker in Baghdad would typically earn a 2 percent commission on a two-way trade. “It was not easy to start with,” Taha says. “People got scared just hearing the word Iraq. Now, we see more and more smart money coming.” Taha is on the verge of his biggest deal ever. Along with HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Morgan Stanley (MS) , Rabee is managing the initial public offering of Asiacell Communications PJSC, Iraq’s first mobile phone service provider and one of its largest companies. Asiacell had about 10 million customers and $1.8 billion in revenue in 2011. According to two people with direct knowledge of the IPO, the share launch of up to $1 billion could happen as early as the end of this year and would value Asiacell at about $4 billion, doubling the Baghdad exchange’s total market capitalization, which was $4 billion as of June 30. Economic Potential “Asiacell’s IPO will be a milestone for Iraq and its believers,” says Henrik Kahm, investment analyst at Stockholm-based Fund Management Group , which operates an Iraq fund of about $20 million. Taha became a believer earlier than most. From 1997 to 2008, he worked as a money manager in the Middle East, first for Mobius’s Templeton Emerging Markets Group and then for Soros’s Quantum hedge fund. He says he was particularly struck by Iraq’s economic potential just ahead of the global credit crunch in 2008, when he noticed that Iraqi shares were mostly trading at about half their book value while stock markets across the region were booming. Taha figured Iraq had nowhere to go but up after the devastation wrought over two decades by the Iran- Iraq war , the Gulf War and the Iraq war. Hitting Bottom He timed his entry well. Since hitting bottom at $13.6 billion in 2003, the year U.S.-U.K. coalition forces invaded Iraq, gross domestic product has soared. It grew about 10 percent, to $108.4 billion, last year and is expected to expand even faster in the three years through 2014, according to data compiled by the International Monetary Fund and the Washington-based Brookings Institution. One reason for optimism is the relative decline in sectarian violence, which fell to four civilian deaths a day last year compared with 95 a day in 2006, according to the Brookings Institution. Oil production, Iraq’s main industry, reached 2.6 million barrels a day in 2011, making Iraq the world’s ninth-largest producer, according to the International Energy Agency. In 2003, it had collapsed to 1.3 million barrels a day, less than half of its peak production of 2.9 million barrels per day in 1989, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Understandable Caution On the strength of rising production, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki plans to double the government’s $100.5 billion 2012 budget by the end of 2016 and spend $9.8 billion on roads, bridges and housing, according to Construction and Housing Minister Mohammad Saheb al-Darraji. While Taha’s small corner of the economy has also grown -- trading by foreign investors in Iraqi equities tripled to $147 million in 2011 from a year earlier, according to the ISX -- many big investors remain wary. New York-based BlackRock Inc (BLK) ., the world’s largest asset manager, invested just 3.4 percent of its Frontier Investment Trust, or about $4 million, in Iraq, according to a Feb. 29 fact sheet. Such caution is understandable. The Baghdad exchange is 1/16 the size of the market capitalization of Istanbul’s benchmark ISE National 100 Index. The economy of the United Arab Emirates , with a population of 5.1 million compared with Iraq’s 33 million, is three times larger than Iraq’s. What’s more, Iraq sits in the middle of a region wracked by instability. Beyond Bombs To the east, Iran is pursuing a nuclear development program that Israel , among other countries, says could lead to outside intervention, if not war. To the west, a civil war flares in Syria , home to more than 750,000 Iraqi refugees, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Iraq is further hobbled by an underdeveloped legal system and overdependence on oil, says Emma Sky, a visiting professor in the War Studies Department at King’s College London and a former adviser to the U.S. military in Iraq. Taha says he’s been able to see beyond the image of a bloodied and bombed Iraq. The carefree Baghdad of his childhood as the son of a prominent doctor bears little resemblance to the shellshocked capital of today. Skyrocketing oil prices in the 1970s made many Iraqis rich, and he didn’t feel the sting of war until the mid-1980s, when he was a teenager and the conflict with Iran was escalating. Wrong Turn One day he took a wrong turn into an unfamiliar neighborhood and wound up driving down a street eerily decorated in black banners signifying mourning. “There was one house with four banners,” Taha says. He recalls turning down the blaring car radio out of respect. “These things you don’t recover from,” he says. “War forces you to grow up. You are not surprised by things any more, death or whatever. It happens.” After high school, Taha went to Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1986 to study biomedical engineering. As graduation approached in 1990, he was getting ready to go home when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The United Nations slapped sanctions on Iraq. The economy started to shatter. Taha got a call from his father telling him to stay in the U.S. It wasn’t easy. To earn a living, he worked as a waiter at La Dolce Vita Bistro in Cleveland. Gradually, Taha’s fortunes took a turn for the better in the early 1990s. With money borrowed from family friends, he enrolled in a master’s program in business administration at George Washington University. Lacking Pretense He also turned to the Internet, which many people hadn’t even heard of then. He created pmena.com, a now-defunct website that gathered information about privatization in the Middle East and North Africa. The potential he saw led him into finance. His own career began with a distinct lack of pretense. The office he opened for Templeton (TEM) in Dubai in 1997 was in an apartment above a children’s store called Mummy & Me. “Some brokers, after seeing my address, called up Templeton to see if I was for real,” he says. In 2006, he went to work for Soros, co-managing a hedge fund out of Istanbul. While he was on vacation the following year, a small jet he was traveling in made an emergency landing and had to be rescued by the Greek coast guard. “I felt my life could go away any minute,” Taha says. “If I want to do something,” he remembers thinking, “I better start now.” Going Home He resigned and returned to Baghdad to transform Rabee from a personal investment vehicle into what it is today. Someday, Taha says, he may move his Turkish wife, Ipek Cem Taha , a businesswoman and former TV journalist; their two daughters, 9 and 10; and a 4-year-old son back to the city of his childhood. Not now. “It’s not because of the bombs that I wouldn’t want my kids to live there; it’s the mentality,” he says. “There’s one thing that takes a long time and real effort to repair: the hate brought by the war, between Shiite and Sunni, Kurds and others, rich and poor, you name it.” In the meantime, he will do what he’s always done: keep calm and carry on. -- Editors: Stryker McGuire, Rick Levinson To contact the reporters on this story: Zijing Wu in Hong Kong at zwu17@bloomberg.net ; To contact the editor responsible for this story: Philip Lagerkranser at lagerkrabser@bloomberg.net",['Zijing Wu'],"Baghdad Broker Dodges Bombs to Rack Up Stock Trades It was exceptionally cold in Sulaymaniyah, a city in northern Iraq ’s Kurdish region, on the morning of Dec. 22. Shwan Taha was sitting in the airport lounge with a bag of gifts, waiting to get back to his wife and children at home in Istanbul. Just before boarding, he got a call on his mobile phone from Rabee Securities, the Baghdad-based brokerage he owns, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its December issue. The manager was on the line to report that a car bomb had exploded next door at the government anti-corruption agency. More from the December 2012 issue of Bloomberg Markets: Taha hung up. Fortunately, the last trading day of the year had been two days earlier, so none of Rabee’s 16 employees were in the office. He tapped out an e-mail to Rabee’s clients that said in part: “All client information is safe in multiple locations inside and outside Iraq. Praying for a peaceful New Year.” Recalling his firm’s brush with danger six months later, Taha says such incidents are a hazard of doing business -- and making money -- in one of the world’s most dangerous frontier markets. “I’ve always told people the major risk of running Rabee is, one day it may blow up, not Lehman style but physically,” Taha says, spreading both arms to suggest an explosion. “What can you do?” Biggest Brokerage Taha, who’s 6 foot 2 inches (1.88 meters) tall and has dark curly hair, is sitting in his office in Istanbul, where he spends a third of his time. The 43-year-old smiles and points to his iPhone case emblazoned with a morale-boosting exhortation made famous by a World War II-era poster in the U.K.: “Keep calm and carry on.” That’s what Taha has had to do for years as chairman and sole owner of the biggest stock brokerage tailored to foreign investors in postwar Iraq. Born in Baghdad to Kurdish parents and raised in the city, he bought Rabee for a small, undisclosed sum in 1998 to handle his personal trades in Iraqi stocks. It now handles about 80 percent of all share transactions by foreigners on the Iraq Stock Exchange (ISX), says Taha, whose selling point to his clients is that he’s an Iraqi with a decade of experience working at different times for investors Mark Mobius and George Soros. Other Baghdad brokers deal mostly with Iraqi clients. ‘Smart Money’ “Rabee stands out from all Iraqi brokers because Shwan understands how things work with Western investors,” says Geoffrey Batt, a partner at New York-based Euphrates Advisors LLC, an Iraq-focused hedge fund with about $27 million under management. Taha estimates Rabee has funneled about $200 million in investments through the ISX since 2008, when the brokerage began attracting non-Iraqi investors. A broker in Baghdad would typically earn a 2 percent commission on a two-way trade. “It was not easy to start with,” Taha says. “People got scared just hearing the word Iraq. Now, we see more and more smart money coming.” Taha is on the verge of his biggest deal ever. Along with HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Morgan Stanley (MS) , Rabee is managing the initial public offering of Asiacell Communications PJSC, Iraq’s first mobile phone service provider and one of its largest companies. Asiacell had about 10 million customers and $1.8 billion in revenue in 2011. According to two people with direct knowledge of the IPO, the share launch of up to $1 billion could happen as early as the end of this year and would value Asiacell at about $4 billion, doubling the Baghdad exchange’s total market capitalization, which was $4 billion as of June 30. Economic Potential “Asiacell’s IPO will be a milestone for Iraq and its believers,” says Henrik Kahm, investment analyst at Stockholm-based Fund Management Group , which operates an Iraq fund of about $20 million. Taha became a believer earlier than most. From 1997 to 2008, he worked as a money manager in the Middle East, first for Mobius’s Templeton Emerging Markets Group and then for Soros’s Quantum hedge fund. He says he was particularly struck by Iraq’s economic potential just ahead of the global credit crunch in 2008, when he noticed that Iraqi shares were mostly trading at about half their book value while stock markets across the region were booming. Taha figured Iraq had nowhere to go but up after the devastation wrought over two decades by the Iran- Iraq war , the Gulf War and the Iraq war. Hitting Bottom He timed his entry well. Since hitting bottom at $13.6 billion in 2003, the year U.S.-U.K. coalition forces invaded Iraq, gross domestic product has soared. It grew about 10 percent, to $108.4 billion, last year and is expected to expand even faster in the three years through 2014, according to data compiled by the International Monetary Fund and the Washington-based Brookings Institution. One reason for optimism is the relative decline in sectarian violence, which fell to four civilian deaths a day last year compared with 95 a day in 2006, according to the Brookings Institution. Oil production, Iraq’s main industry, reached 2.6 million barrels a day in 2011, making Iraq the world’s ninth-largest producer, according to the International Energy Agency. In 2003, it had collapsed to 1.3 million barrels a day, less than half of its peak production of 2.9 million barrels per day in 1989, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Understandable Caution On the strength of rising production, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki plans to double the government’s $100.5 billion 2012 budget by the end of 2016 and spend $9.8 billion on roads, bridges and housing, according to Construction and Housing Minister Mohammad Saheb al-Darraji. While Taha’s small corner of the economy has also grown -- trading by foreign investors in Iraqi equities tripled to $147 million in 2011 from a year earlier, according to the ISX -- many big investors remain wary. New York-based BlackRock Inc (BLK) ., the world’s largest asset manager, invested just 3.4 percent of its Frontier Investment Trust, or about $4 million, in Iraq, according to a Feb. 29 fact sheet. Such caution is understandable. The Baghdad exchange is 1/16 the size of the market capitalization of Istanbul’s benchmark ISE National 100 Index. The economy of the United Arab Emirates , with a population of 5.1 million compared with Iraq’s 33 million, is three times larger than Iraq’s. What’s more, Iraq sits in the middle of a region wracked by instability. Beyond Bombs To the east, Iran is pursuing a nuclear development program that Israel , among other countries, says could lead to outside intervention, if not war. To the west, a civil war flares in Syria , home to more than 750,000 Iraqi refugees, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Iraq is further hobbled by an underdeveloped legal system and overdependence on oil, says Emma Sky, a visiting professor in the War Studies Department at King’s College London and a former adviser to the U.S. military in Iraq. Taha says he’s been able to see beyond the image of a bloodied and bombed Iraq. The carefree Baghdad of his childhood as the son of a prominent doctor bears little resemblance to the shellshocked capital of today. Skyrocketing oil prices in the 1970s made many Iraqis rich, and he didn’t feel the sting of war until the mid-1980s, when he was a teenager and the conflict with Iran was escalating. Wrong Turn One day he took a wrong turn into an unfamiliar neighborhood and wound up driving down a street eerily decorated in black banners signifying mourning. “There was one house with four banners,” Taha says. He recalls turning down the blaring car radio out of respect. “These things you don’t recover from,” he says. “War forces you to grow up. You are not surprised by things any more, death or whatever. It happens.” After high school, Taha went to Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1986 to study biomedical engineering. As graduation approached in 1990, he was getting ready to go home when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The United Nations slapped sanctions on Iraq. The economy started to shatter. Taha got a call from his father telling him to stay in the U.S. It wasn’t easy. To earn a living, he worked as a waiter at La Dolce Vita Bistro in Cleveland. Gradually, Taha’s fortunes took a turn for the better in the early 1990s. With money borrowed from family friends, he enrolled in a master’s program in business administration at George Washington University. Lacking Pretense He also turned to the Internet, which many people hadn’t even heard of then. He created pmena.com, a now-defunct website that gathered information about privatization in the Middle East and North Africa. The potential he saw led him into finance.

Local-currency notes also advanced after Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said yesterday the amount of debt to be sold at regular auctions in the three months to December will probably drop from this quarter. The yield on 20-year notes fell to 5.722 percent at an auction yesterday, the lowest since at least 2002, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. “The central bank saying it still has room tends to support bonds and is positive for markets in general,” said Raul Tan, head of the balance-sheet segment of Rizal Commercial Banking Corp.

The government had a budget surplus of 2.52 billion pesos ($60 million) in August, narrowing the eight-month gap to 71.21 billion pesos, it reported today.

Inflation Target The yield on the Philippine government’s 6.25 percent bonds due September 2014 fell 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 2.59 percent, according to midday fixing prices at Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp. “We have the policy space,” Tetangco wrote in a Sept. 24 mobile-phone message, in reply to whether the central bank still sees scope for further easing this year. “We will recalibrate as appropriate, given we have the room.” Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas kept its overnight borrowing rate at a record-low 3.75 percent on Sept. 13 after three reductions earlier in the year. Tetangco said Sept. 19 that inflation, which accelerated to a seven-month high of 3.8 percent in August, was well within the central bank’s target. “As far as the central bank’s inflation target is concerned, there’s still room and the pressure on inflation isn’t really there yet,” Tan said.

Jewish Jocks Ask Questions; Football in a Sugar Town,['David M.Shribman'],2012-11-12 05:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/jewish-jocks-ask-questions-football-in-a-sugar-town.html,"Let’s start by dispensing with the inevitable joke. No, the new book “ Jewish Jocks ,” an anthology edited by Franklin Foer and Marc Tracy, isn’t a skinny pamphlet. Not that it has the girth of Churchill’s World War II memoirs. It’s just a nice, respectable book, full of (mostly) nice Jewish boys. In it, Ira Berkow posits a fifth question to go along with the traditional four: Did American League pitchers deny Hank Greenberg the chance to beat Babe Ruth ’s home-run record in 1938 by feeding him lousy pitches? The answer is that they didn’t. Greenberg himself describes this theory, held with devout conviction for a generation, as “pure baloney.” This book may have the best opening sentence of the year, by Jane Leavy: “ Sandy Koufax ruined me for other men.” And perhaps the best chapter titles, including “Hebrew Mind, Cossack Body,” about the footballer Sid Luckman, and “The Coach Who Never Paid Retail,” about basketball’s Red Auerbach. Then there’s Dolph Schayes, probably the best Jewish professional basketball player ever. He was selected to the all- star team a dozen times; played 764 consecutive games, then a record; and was a power forward who, in Tracy’s phrase,  “moved without the ball like a dog in heat.” ‘Point Shaver’ Along with basketball’s Nancy Lieberman and tennis’s Renee Richards, the editors had the wit to include characters like Jack Molinas, known as the “point shaver” but really an entrepreneur in the fraud and gambling trade. He called his company Fixers Inc. He served time in Attica. And happily there is a member of my own tribe, which is to say an ink-stained wretch. He is the great Washington Post sports columnist Shirley Povich, about whom Noam Scheiber says, “The David Broders and Teddy Whites would have killed for such access.” Right about that. “ Muck City ,” by Bryan Mealer, is the latest in a growing genre of sports books -- artful portraits of forgotten corners of America where unforgettable acts of sporting courage and achievement occur, often in one magical season. The enclave under consideration here, Belle Glade, is in the deepest Florida Everglades, and its high school, Glades Central, is turbocharged with gridiron talent (30 pro players since 1985, five in the first round of the NFL draft ). Hard Lessons And the community? Belle Glade is a sugar town where life is not so sweet. Mealer calls it “a place of toil and hard lessons.” A third of all pregnancies belong to a teenager. In the migrant quarter many of the buildings have been condemned. “In Belle Glade, where the risk of joblessness, prison or early death followed each boy like a toxic cloud,” Mealer writes, “high school football was more than religion, it was like salvation itself -- the raft by which to flee a ship that kept drifting back in time.” One of those on the raft was Santonio Holmes , Super Bowl MVP, now with the New York Jets. Ultramarathon runner Ed Ayres is looking for a different kind of salvation -- for the soul, for the planet. The races he’s been running for more than half a century have inspired athletes worldwide and reshaped our ideas about endurance and sustainability. That’s a tall order for a runner, even one who used to toil at the Worldwatch Institute. Ayres’s new book, “ The Longest Race ,” is partly a chronicle of his experience in the fabled JFK 50 Mile ultramarathon, but it’s also about so much more. “We ran through the town as if in a dream,” he writes, and off we go. Smaller Footprint There is as much thinking as running in these pages. Ayres riffs off his work on “ecological footprints” and before long he leads us to see that “a person who achieves a smaller footprint doesn’t just use less, but also gets more out of what he or she uses.” That leads us to see that for “a long-distance runner, a smaller footprint meant not only not trashing the trail, the way an all-terrain vehicle would; it meant more ground covered per breath of air taken.” Remember that on your next jog. Much of this he applies to the environment, which after all is about the long run. Indeed, with all his talk about “oxygen debt” and “research depletion” it soon becomes clear that this book isn’t just about an athletic race. It’s also about the human race. “Jewish Jocks: An Unorthodox Hall of Fame” is published by Twelve (285 pages, $26.99). “Muck City: Winning and Losing in Football’s Forgotten Town” is published by Crown Archetype (322 pages, $25). “The Longest Race: A Lifelong Runner, an Iconic Ultramarathon and the Case for Human Endurance” is published by the Experiment (241 pages, $23.95).

Indeed, with all his talk about “oxygen debt” and “research depletion” it soon becomes clear that this book isn’t just about an athletic race. It’s also about the human race. “Jewish Jocks: An Unorthodox Hall of Fame” is published by Twelve (285 pages, $26.99). “Muck City: Winning and Losing in Football’s Forgotten Town” is published by Crown Archetype (322 pages, $25). “The Longest Race: A Lifelong Runner, an Iconic Ultramarathon and the Case for Human Endurance” is published by the Experiment (241 pages, $23.95).

Zon’s Chief Executive Officer Rodrigo Costa and Chief Financial Officer Jose Pedro Pereira da Costa, who were also attending the conference, declined to comment on a possible merger. “I have absolutely no comment to make,” Costa said.

The assembly authorized the municipal government to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with Alstom Transport for 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) of tracks, including seven kilometers underground, based on a feasibility study by Egis Rail. Alstom is “ready to provide all the technical support” during the feasibility period and expects to eventually win the contract, Miodrag Jelisavcic, Alstom’s representative in Serbia, said in a phone interview. The project is part of a “strategic partnership” signed in April between French President Nicholas Sarkozy and Boris Tadic, the president of the former Yugoslav republic that wants to win European Union candidacy status as early as this year. Among financing options for the subway plan, France would help secure the financing and Alstom may choose a subcontractor for digging tunnels, building platforms and train stops. Serbian Deputy Premier Bozidar Djelic estimated Alstom Transport’s part of the contract would be worth 1 billion euros ($1.34 billion) following his trip to France. Today’s document doesn’t specify the value. Another co-financing plan have Serbian find funds for the construction part of the project and Alstom provide trains and rail equipment. A third option is a public-private partnership, in which Alstom would become a concessionaire for the future subway. France pledged support of 3 million euros for the feasibility study and the designs. ‘Sufficient’ Finance Capacity The study and the design for the first subway line are set to be completed by the end of 2012, followed by a financing agreement. Serbia then has two years to negotiate a binding contract with Alstom, without seeking another company for the job. The first line may open as early as 2017. The city has “sufficient capacity” to support the subway development “because our level of debt is not big and we can service loans that we take,” Mayor Dragan Djilas said today at an assembly session at city hall.

Fed’s Bullard Opposed to Tying Policy to Rate of Unemployment,['Steve Matthews'],2012-09-21 01:05:44,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/fed-s-bullard-opposed-to-tying-policy-to-rate-of-unemployment.html,"Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said he opposes tying monetary policy to a target for the unemployment rate, which he believes isn’t the best measure of job-market health. “I have warned the committee against using specific numbers on unemployment,” Bullard said to reporters today after a speech in South Bend, Indiana, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee. “Unemployment is a fickle variable,” he said. “It can go up and down because of labor-force participation changes as has happened in recent years and even the most recent unemployment report,” he said. “We would be better served by taking an overall approach to labor-market conditions and assessing the situation that way.” Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota said today in a speech that the central bank should hold interest rates at around zero until unemployment drops below 5.5 percent. The comment aligned him with the FOMC’s decision last week to continue purchasing bonds until labor markets “improve substantially.” European unemployment has been elevated because of changes in the structure of the labor market, Bullard said. Policy makers “would still be waiting” if they had tied policy to a low level of joblessness. Bullard said he opposed the FOMC decision last week to begin a third round of asset purchases. The U.S. economy is expanding at about a 2 percent rate in the second half and will probably to accelerate to more than 3 percent growth next year, he said. Bullard joined the St. Louis Fed’s research department in 1990 and became president of the regional bank in 2008.

French Economy Barely Grows as Hollande Faces Jobless Surge,['Mark Deen'],2012-11-15 08:09:35,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/french-economy-barely-grows-as-hollande-grapples-with-job-cuts.html,"France ’s economy barely expanded in the third quarter, underlining the challenge President Francois Hollande faces in addressing the stagnation that is extending into its second year. Gross domestic product rose 0.2 percent in the quarter from the previous three months when it fell a revised 0.1 percent, national statistics office Insee in Paris said today in an e- mailed statement. Economists had forecast no change, according to the median of 25 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. GDP rose 0.2 percent from a year earlier. “The third quarter is probably the result of a temporary rebound at the European level,” said Michel Martinez, an economist at Societe Generale in Paris. Business sentiment suggests the French “economy is heading to a moderate recession or at best remaining flat.” With unemployment climbing and his popularity sliding, Hollande is seeking to revive the competitiveness of Europe ’s second-largest economy by offering companies a 20 billion-euro ($25.5 billion) tax cut starting next year and pressing unions to offer more labor flexibility. Still, the strategy may take time to pay off and surveys show business confidence near three- year lows. The second-quarter GDP decline announced today was the first in more than three years. Yet the economy has been more or less flat since the first three months of 2011, which was the last time it had a quarterly gain of more than 0.2 percent. Exports, Investment Growth in the most recent quarter was driven by recoveries in exports and consumer spending , while investment, which powered France’s recovery from the last recession in 2009, slumped. Household spending rose 0.3 percent after a 0.2 percent drop previously, while external trade contributed 0.3 percent to growth after declines in the previous two quarters. Investment by non-financial companies fell 0.4 percent. “This resilience is unlikely to be sustained in the fourth quarter, when we see France’s GDP growth going negative as headwinds build,” said Thomas Costerg, an economist at Standard Chartered (STAN) in London. “The continued labor-market deterioration is likely to dampen consumption, while decelerating European trade affects exports.” Companies are holding off expansion as Hollande prepares to introduce 30 billion euros in tax increases and spending cuts next year to shrink the budget deficit and recession across southern Europe cuts export demand. Job Cuts Manufacturers including PSA Peugeot Citroen SA (UG) and Alcatel- Lucent (ALU) have announced thousands of job cuts in recent months, driving up unemployment to its highest since 1999. Medef, France’s many business lobby, is asking unions to agree to ease restrictions on firing and reduce jobless benefits as part of negotiations initiated by Hollande to improve France’s competitiveness, Les Echos newspaper reported today. Hollande this week rejected calls for “shock” measures to jumpstart the economy and asked be judged on jobs and growth at the end of his five-year mandate. “The question that matters in my eyes isn’t the state of opinion, it’s the state of France in five years,” he said this week in a 2 ½-hour press conference in Paris, the first of such semi-annual gatherings he has promised. “I want to be judged, when the time comes, on employment and growth.” Six months after gaining office, the Socialist president is struggling to retain support from those who voted for him while convincing critics including the International Monetary Fund that he’ll modernize Europe’s second-largest economy amid the region’s three-year-old sovereign debt crisis. About 38 percent of French voters approve of Hollande’s performance as president, down from 62 percent in May, according to a BVA poll published in today’s Parisien newspaper. The survey of 1,000 voters was taken after Hollande’s press conference this week. It has a margin of error of about 3 percent.

Business sentiment suggests the French “economy is heading to a moderate recession or at best remaining flat.” With unemployment climbing and his popularity sliding, Hollande is seeking to revive the competitiveness of Europe ’s second-largest economy by offering companies a 20 billion-euro ($25.5 billion) tax cut starting next year and pressing unions to offer more labor flexibility. Still, the strategy may take time to pay off and surveys show business confidence near three- year lows. The second-quarter GDP decline announced today was the first in more than three years. Yet the economy has been more or less flat since the first three months of 2011, which was the last time it had a quarterly gain of more than 0.2 percent. Exports, Investment Growth in the most recent quarter was driven by recoveries in exports and consumer spending , while investment, which powered France’s recovery from the last recession in 2009, slumped. Household spending rose 0.3 percent after a 0.2 percent drop previously, while external trade contributed 0.3 percent to growth after declines in the previous two quarters. Investment by non-financial companies fell 0.4 percent. “This resilience is unlikely to be sustained in the fourth quarter, when we see France’s GDP growth going negative as headwinds build,” said Thomas Costerg, an economist at Standard Chartered (STAN) in London. “The continued labor-market deterioration is likely to dampen consumption, while decelerating European trade affects exports.” Companies are holding off expansion as Hollande prepares to introduce 30 billion euros in tax increases and spending cuts next year to shrink the budget deficit and recession across southern Europe cuts export demand. Job Cuts Manufacturers including PSA Peugeot Citroen SA (UG) and Alcatel- Lucent (ALU) have announced thousands of job cuts in recent months, driving up unemployment to its highest since 1999. Medef, France’s many business lobby, is asking unions to agree to ease restrictions on firing and reduce jobless benefits as part of negotiations initiated by Hollande to improve France’s competitiveness, Les Echos newspaper reported today. Hollande this week rejected calls for “shock” measures to jumpstart the economy and asked be judged on jobs and growth at the end of his five-year mandate. “The question that matters in my eyes isn’t the state of opinion, it’s the state of France in five years,” he said this week in a 2 ½-hour press conference in Paris, the first of such semi-annual gatherings he has promised. “I want to be judged, when the time comes, on employment and growth.” Six months after gaining office, the Socialist president is struggling to retain support from those who voted for him while convincing critics including the International Monetary Fund that he’ll modernize Europe’s second-largest economy amid the region’s three-year-old sovereign debt crisis. About 38 percent of French voters approve of Hollande’s performance as president, down from 62 percent in May, according to a BVA poll published in today’s Parisien newspaper. The survey of 1,000 voters was taken after Hollande’s press conference this week. It has a margin of error of about 3 percent.

(BB) , the Canadian maker of wireless communication devices, didn’t infringe patents belonging to a Michigan company, a federal appeals court ruled. St. Clair Intellectual Property Consultants Inc. sued BlackBerry, formerly known as Research In Motion Ltd., in federal court in Delaware in June 2008, alleging that four patents related to digital cameras in mobile telephones were infringed. The court entered a judgment against St. Clair in September 2012. St. Clair appealed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the trial court’s ruling in a judgment delivered without comment. The appellate case is St. Clair Intellectual Property v.

(DIS) ’s Marvel Enterprises unit didn’t have to continue pay royalties to an Arizona inventor after his patent expired, a federal appeals court ruled. Stephen Kimble, whose patent 5,072,856 covers a toy web-shooting glove, sued Marvel for patent infringement in 1997, claiming that the Spiderman Web Blaster infringed his patent. In 2001, the parties settled that dispute, granting Kimble an initial cash payment and a percentage on future sales. In 2006, Marvel entered into an agreement with toymaker Hasbro Inc. to produce the toy. Kimble and Marvel then disputed the issue of further payment, and he filed another suit. The court found that under his royalty agreement with Marvel, the payments would stop when the patent expired. Kimble appealed that ruling, claiming the agreement covered both patent and non-patent rights and that his compensation should continue. The appeals court in a July 16 ruling said that a license that covers both patent and non-patent rights is unenforceable after the patent expires unless the agreement provided for a discount for the non-patent rights. In the absence of a discount, the court said the post-expiration royalty payments were “an improper extension of the patent monopoly.” The case is Kimble v.

Copyright Diller’s Vimeo Seeks to End Vivendi Music Copyright Lawsuit Vimeo, the video-sharing website owned by Barry Diller ’s IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI) , said federal law protects it against a Vivendi SA (VIV) copyright lawsuit over music that includes recordings by the Beatles and the Beach Boys. U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams heard arguments yesterday on Vimeo’s motion to throw out the case. She said at the end of the three-hour hearing in Manhattan that she would rule later. Vivendi labels including Capitol Records sued Vimeo in 2009 claiming that the website “induces and encourages its users to upload” copyrighted videos and songs it wasn’t authorized to display. The songs include the Beatles’ “Let It Be,” the Beach Boys’ “Surfin’ USA” and Radiohead’s “High and Dry.” Users post homemade videos in which they lip-synch to the infringed songs, the labels said in the complaint. Vimeo, based in New York , denied infringing copyrights and said that it’s protected by the safe-harbor provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA. The safe-harbor rule applies if a site removes infringing material when informed about it. The company, which has more than 14 million registered users, gets its revenue from subscription fees and advertising. The labels said that Vimeo can’t be protected by law because it knew that the uploaded videos contained unlicensed copyrighted material and that it benefited financially from them. The labels asked the judge to deny Vimeo’s motion and grant them partial summary judgment. If Abrams rejects the motions, the case may go to trial by jury. The litigation had been on hold pending a ruling in a similar case, in which Viacom Inc. (VIAB) sued Google Inc.’s YouTube for displaying Viacom’s copyrighted television and movie content on the web without authorization. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower-court ruling in favor of YouTube and sent the case back to district court. U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton then dismissed Viacom’s suit in April, saying YouTube was protected from liability by the Copyright Act’s safe-harbor provision. The case is Capitol Records LLC v.

Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage Outdated Mail Rule Helps Pangang, Kolon Elude U.S. Charges China’s Pangang Group Co. and Korea’s Kolon Industries Inc. (120110) have eluded U.S. criminal charges of trade-secret theft for months. Unlike fugitive security contractor Edward Snowden, they aren’t hiding from authorities. Pangang and Kolon can’t be forced yet to face the accusations in court because federal rules dating to the 1940s require prosecutors to issue a summons the old-fashioned way -- by mailing it to a U.S. address. The companies said they don’t have offices, employees or agents in the U.S. and can’t be served. Federal judges in California and Virginia have mostly agreed. Prosecutors must file papers this week telling a judge in San Francisco how they will proceed with Pangang while a judge in Richmond, Virginia, is scheduled to hear arguments in Kolon’s case. The issue threatens to derail the case against Pangang. The company was charged in San Francisco last year with conspiring to steal secrets from DuPont Co. (DD) about titanium dioxide, a white pigment used in paint, plastics and paper. Kolon and five of its executives were charged in October with stealing trade secrets from DuPont related to the manufacture of Kevlar, the anti-ballistic fiber used in police and military gear. Prosecutors are required to serve summonses on defendants by delivering copies to officers or legal representatives and mailing copies to the defendants’ last known U.S. address, according to federal rules of criminal procedure. The Justice Department , saying the procedures have fallen behind the “new reality” of a global economy and electronic communications, recommended the committee allow the serving of summonses outside the U.S. by agreed-upon delivery methods with foreign jurisdictions, according to an October letter from then-Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer to the committee. The case is U.S. v. Kolon Industries, 12-cr-00137, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond). The Pangang case is U.S. v. Liew, 11-cr-00573, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).

Brixmor May Be Biggest Retail REIT Offering in 20 Years,['Hui-yong Yu'],2013-07-19 18:08:56,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/brixmor-may-be-biggest-retail-reit-offering-in-20-years.html,"The initial public offering of Brixmor Property Group, the second-largest U.S. shopping center landlord, may be the biggest for a retail real estate investment trust since Simon Property Group Inc.’s IPO 20 years ago. The sale of shares in New York-based Brixmor, a Blackstone Group LP (BX) unit, probably “will raise $700 million or more,” according to Renaissance Capital LLC , a Greenwich, Connecticut-based research firm. That would be the largest IPO by a shopping-focused REIT since Simon’s $840 million share sale in 1993, data from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts show. Brixmor yesterday made its first filing to go public, with pricing yet to be announced. New York-based Blackstone is taking advantage of a rally in shares of REITs that own and operate shopping centers. The Bloomberg REIT Shopping Center index is up about 11 percent from a low on June 20 after falling from a five-year high in May amid concern that rising interest rates would increase landlords’ costs. Simon and Brixmor operate in different sectors of the retail REIT industry. Brixmor owns mainly grocery store-anchored, open-air centers, while Indianapolis-based Simon owns mainly enclosed malls and upscale outlets. Brixmor owns 522 shopping centers with 87 million square feet (8.1 million square meters) of space. The assets that form Brixmor’s core were acquired in Blackstone’s $9 billion purchase of U.S. shopping centers from Australia ’s Centro Properties Group in 2011. Brixmor is second to Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM) among U.S. shopping-center landlords by number of properties. Peter Rose , a Blackstone spokesman, declined to comment on the planned Brixmor stock sale. REIT IPOs Simon, the country’s biggest owner of shopping malls, was the fifth-biggest IPO of a property trust, according to the REIT association. There have been eight REIT IPOs of more than $700 million, the trade group said. Brixmor is the third-biggest real estate asset held by Blackstone, which has said it plans to sell large property holdings over the next 12 to 18 months as property values rebound from the financial crisis and some funds approach the end of their term. The company reiterated that guidance in its second-quarter earnings conference call yesterday. “Realizations in real estate continue to ramp up,” Blackstone President Tony James said on the call. The firm has said it’s planning an IPO for the Hilton Worldwide Inc. hotel chain, and sales of office buildings acquired in the $39 billion purchase of Equity Office Properties Trust in 2007, the firm’s two biggest property holdings. General Growth The firm sold $2.1 billion of real estate assets last quarter, including shares of General Growth Properties Inc., the largest U.S. mall landlord after Simon, James said. Blackstone, the world’s biggest manager of alternative investments to stocks and bonds, hasn’t said whether it would sell any shares in the Brixmor IPO. It said it plans to hold a majority stake in the company after the sale. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo Securities are managing the Brixmor offering, according to the filing. The shares will trade under the symbol BRX. Brixmor will use the proceeds from the offering primarily to repay debt. The company obtained a $2.75 billion credit facility from a group of banks on July 16, according to the filing. Revenue rose 2.3 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier to $287.1 million, Brixmor said in the filing. The company’s net loss narrowed to $19.5 million from $37.9 million.

The sale of shares in New York-based Brixmor, a Blackstone Group LP (BX) unit, probably “will raise $700 million or more,” according to Renaissance Capital LLC , a Greenwich, Connecticut-based research firm. That would be the largest IPO by a shopping-focused REIT since Simon’s $840 million share sale in 1993, data from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts show. Brixmor yesterday made its first filing to go public, with pricing yet to be announced. New York-based Blackstone is taking advantage of a rally in shares of REITs that own and operate shopping centers. The Bloomberg REIT Shopping Center index is up about 11 percent from a low on June 20 after falling from a five-year high in May amid concern that rising interest rates would increase landlords’ costs. Simon and Brixmor operate in different sectors of the retail REIT industry. Brixmor owns mainly grocery store-anchored, open-air centers, while Indianapolis-based Simon owns mainly enclosed malls and upscale outlets. Brixmor owns 522 shopping centers with 87 million square feet (8.1 million square meters) of space. The assets that form Brixmor’s core were acquired in Blackstone’s $9 billion purchase of U.S. shopping centers from Australia ’s Centro Properties Group in 2011. Brixmor is second to Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM) among U.S. shopping-center landlords by number of properties. Peter Rose , a Blackstone spokesman, declined to comment on the planned Brixmor stock sale.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and one-time items may reach 1.4 billion euros ($1.8 billion) by 2014, the Leverkusen-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. Lanxess, which had set that profit goal for 2015, also said it expects to lift earnings to 1.8 billion euros by 2018. Lanxess is accelerating growth by expanding in faster growing markets, building synthetic rubber factories in Singapore and China as well as buying Brazilian rubber maker Petroflex. The company, spun off from Bayer AG (BAYN) in 2005 as a hodge podge of unprofitable units, has transformed itself by selling lower-margin commodity operations such as materials for paper, fibers and styrene plastics. “We have transformed Lanxess into a growth company,” Chief Executive Officer Axel Heitmann said in today’s statement. “We will stick to our proven dual-track strategy of organic and external growth.” The chemical today reiterated this year’s goal for operating profit to grow 5 percent to 10 percent from 1.15 billion euros in 2011. Lanxess said earlier this month it will build a 235 million-euro plant for ethylene propylene diene monomer, or EPDM, used in car wiper blades and door sealants in Changzhou Yangtze Riverside Industrial Park. The investment comes on top of butyl and butadiene factories in Singapore scheduled to start production in 2013 and 2015 respectively.

Harvard Lags Peers as Endowment Fails to Post 2012 Gain,['Michael Mc Donald'],2012-09-28 17:05:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/harvard-lags-peers-as-endowment-loses-less-than-1-.html,"Harvard University, the world’s wealthiest college, lost 0.05 percent on its investments in the 12 months through June, the second drop in four years, trailing peers such as Yale University. The size of Harvard’s endowment fell to $30.7 billion in the period, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based university said. It also failed to keep pace with Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as it seeks to recover from a record loss of 27 percent in fiscal 2009. Harvard’s fund lagged behind the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) , which gained 5.5 percent in the same period, including reinvested dividends. Jane Mendillo, the head of Harvard Management Co., which oversees the endowment, said the performance owed largely to the university’s investments in publicly traded non-U.S. and emerging-market shares, which had losses of 11 percent and 17 percent for the year, respectively. She said Harvard “carries relatively more exposure” to these types of assets compared with other universities. “Over the last few years, markets have become quite turbulent and managing through complexity has become one of our themes since the financial crisis of 2008,” Mendillo, 54, wrote in a report released yesterday. “The 2012 fiscal year provided plenty of evidence that this theme remains relevant.” The size of the endowment, which peaked in size at about $37 billion before the crisis in 2008, fell by about $1 billion from $31.7 billion over the last year after accounting for the investment loss and transfers to the university to cover academic operating costs. Fund Performance Mendillo, who first joined Harvard Management in 1987, has cut leverage and tried selling underperforming private-equity investments since she took over the fund in 2008 amid a meltdown in global financial markets. The endowment gained 11 percent in 2010 and 21 percent last year as markets recovered, and has a 20-year annual average return of 12 percent, putting it among the top performers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While non-U.S. equities and emerging markets tumbled, Harvard’s shares in U.S. companies topped the benchmark with a 9.7 percent gain and its real estate portfolio returned 7.9 percent, according to the report. The university’s natural- resource investments gained 2.4 percent. Mendillo has said she is seeking to expand direct investments in real assets such as tree farms in Brazil to capitalize on the growth of the middle class in emerging markets. Yale, Stanford Harvard’s results are the worst to date for the handful of elite institutions that have posted fiscal 2012 results. Yale, based in New Haven, Connecticut , and the second-wealthiest university, said today its endowment gained 4.7 percent on its investments. The size of the fund fell to $19.3 billion from $19.4 billion because of distributions to support academic operations. Stanford University, near Palo Alto, California , also reported results today, saying its endowment had a 1 percent return on investments. That compares with the 22 percent increase a year earlier. The fund’s value climbed 3.2 percent to $17 billion. “Fiscal year 2012 was a challenging year for international equity markets, which was a drag on the portfolio,” John Powers, chief executive officer of the Stanford Management Co., said in a statement. The University of Pennsylvania , which along with Yale and Harvard is part of the eight-member Ivy League, said last week it gained 1.6 percent for the year ended June 30. Last month, Cambridge-based MIT posted a return of 8 percent, while the University of Chicago said yesterday it had a 6.8 percent return. Princeton University, another Ivy League school, will probably report its endowment earned zero to 5 percent on investments for fiscal 2012, President Shirley Tilghman said earlier this month.

(AOL) , owner of the Huffington Post and TechCrunch, appointed Karen Dykstra as chief financial officer and added PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) ’s Hugh Johnston as director, three months after fending off an activist investor challenge to shake up the board. Dykstra, who served as a board member since 2009, replaces Arthur Minson, who was promoted to chief operating officer in June to reorganize AOL’s operations. Dykstra will no longer remain on the board. Johnson, chief financial officer of PepsiCo, adds consumer retail expertise to the Internet company. “Hugh’s financial expertise and consumer-industry experience makes him a great addition to the board,” AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong said today in a statement. Since the Web portal was spun out of Time Warner Inc. in 2009, Armstrong has transformed AOL into an ad-based publishing business. The company bought the Huffington Post for $315 million last year and invested as much as $300 million in Patch, a local-news division that Armstrong sees commanding as much as $50 million in sales this year. Facing a slump in sales earlier this year, AOL agreed in April to sell and license patents to Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) The company is selling more than 800 patents and related applications to Microsoft. The company announced stock buyback agreements and a special cash dividend last month as part of its steps to return about $1.1 billion to shareholders. The move has helped lift AOL’s stock price, which has more than doubled this year. The rising stock price bolstered Armstrong’s case as he fended off an activist investor’s bid to shake up the board earlier this month. Starboard Value LP, an investment firm owning 3 percent of outstanding shares, had fought to install three directors, saying AOL was spending too much money on failed efforts such as the Patch news sites. Dykstra, a former partner at Plainfield Asset Management LLC, will serve as a key member of the executive team, according to the company statement.

Since the Web portal was spun out of Time Warner Inc. in 2009, Armstrong has transformed AOL into an ad-based publishing business. The company bought the Huffington Post for $315 million last year and invested as much as $300 million in Patch, a local-news division that Armstrong sees commanding as much as $50 million in sales this year. Facing a slump in sales earlier this year, AOL agreed in April to sell and license patents to Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) The company is selling more than 800 patents and related applications to Microsoft. The company announced stock buyback agreements and a special cash dividend last month as part of its steps to return about $1.1 billion to shareholders. The move has helped lift AOL’s stock price, which has more than doubled this year. The rising stock price bolstered Armstrong’s case as he fended off an activist investor’s bid to shake up the board earlier this month. Starboard Value LP, an investment firm owning 3 percent of outstanding shares, had fought to install three directors, saying AOL was spending too much money on failed efforts such as the Patch news sites. Dykstra, a former partner at Plainfield Asset Management LLC, will serve as a key member of the executive team, according to the company statement.

"Allot, Teva Lead Record Rout on Growth Outlook: Israel Overnight",['Belinda Cao' 'Alex' 'er Cuadros'],2011-10-02 15:25:22,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-01/allot-teva-lead-record-rout-on-growth-outlook-israel-overnight.html,"Israeli companies listed in the U.S. posted the biggest quarterly loss on record amid concern that the global economy may be headed for another recession and political risk in the Middle East is worsening. The Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index of the largest Israeli companies traded in New York fell 21 percent in the third quarter, the worst performance according to data going back to August 2005. Declines were led by the 47 percent drop in Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT) , the nation’s biggest maker of high-speed networking equipment, while Internet Gold-Golden Lines Ltd. (IGLD) , an internet service provider, fell 46 percent. The Israel-US 25 Index trailed the Tel Aviv benchmark TA-25 Index, which dropped 12 percent, the worst quarter since June 2010, as companies in the New York gauge depend more on international sales. The TA-25 Index tumbled 2.2 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv today, the first trading day since Sept. 27. A worldwide equity rout erased about $9.2 trillion from global stocks since the end of June as signs mounted that the world economy is faltering and concern increased in Israel that Palestinians’ push for statehood would create turmoil. “There was a bit of a double-whammy -- the most significant is obviously the global growth concerns,” said Uriel Goren, head of the international clients desk at Tel Aviv- based DS Securities & Investments. “People are feeling that the entire stability of the Middle East is quite shaken right now.” UN Outlook The United Nations Security Council , in its Sept. 30 preliminary discussions about the Palestinian application for full membership to the world body, decided to have a committee of experts meet to examine whether the bid fits the criteria for membership. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been lobbying allies to oppose the measure and the Obama administration says it will exercise its veto if the measure reaches the Security Council. Israel joined countries including Turkey and Brazil in reducing borrowing costs last month as the global economy slumped. The first cut to the benchmark interest rate in 2 1/2 years surprised 20 of 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, who forecast the bank would keep rates unchanged as Israel seeks to tame inflation. More than 400,000 people protested the rising cost of living in street demonstrations in September. The shekel weakened 9.2 percent from the end of June through September, to 3.7486 per dollar, the fourth-best performance among 10 emerging-market currencies in Europe , the Middle East and Africa. Overseas Sales Israeli companies that get most of their sales overseas, such as Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , are affected more by the global slowdown than those that depend on domestic demand, said Gilad Alper, an analyst at Excellence Investments House in Ramat Gan , Israel. Teva’s American depositary receipts, which have the largest market value among U.S.-listed Israeli companies, slid 23 percent in the third quarter amid concern over the future of its best-selling multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone. The drug, which accounted for 23 percent of second-quarter revenue, faces new competition from a competing pill made by Novartis AG. Teva’s biggest market is the U.S. and its performance was also affected by slower growth in the American economy, Alper said. The shares of the world’s biggest generic-drug maker jumped 5.7 percent to 140.70 shekels, or the equivalent of $37.53 in Tel Aviv today. Teva’s New York shares were traded at the steepest premium to its Israeli stock among all companies in the Bloomberg index on Sept. 30. They rose in each of the last five trading days, climbing 0.8 percent to $37.22 on Sept. 30, to widen the gap to $1.70 more than the Israeli shares. Share Offering Allot Communications dropped 14 percent, its biggest decline since Aug. 21, to 37.65 shekels in Tel Aviv, or the equivalent of $10.04. They plummeted 8.5 percent, the most in six weeks, to $9.75 on Sept. 30 in the U.S. Allot fell 47 percent in New York last quarter. The company announced plans on Aug. 1 to issue 4.5 million new shares, then said it would put the offering on hold following declines in the market. Allot’s decline was mainly caused by the company’s offering, which would dilute the value of the shares, said Jay Srivatsa, an analyst at Chardan Capital Markets LLC in New York. A selloff in technology stocks in the U.S. also aggravated the Allot’s share slump, he said. The Standard and Poor’s 500 Information Technology Index lost 8 percent since the end of June, the most in five quarters. “Once the investors start to feel better about the marco conditions in the economy, as well as start getting more into the tech names, we’ll start to see a lot of benefits from that,” Srivatsa said. Share Valuation Fundtech Ltd. (FNDT) , the Israeli provider of banking software for Bank of America Corp. and HSBC Holdings Plc, was the best performer in the Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index in the third quarter, gaining 16 percent. The stock surged after GTCR Golder Rauner LLC, a Chicago-based private-equity firm that owns rival software maker BankServ, offered to buy the company for a 33 percent premium. Fundtech rose 0.2 percent to 85.56 shekels, or the equivalent of $22.82, in Tel Aviv today. Israel, whose population of 7.7 million is similar to Switzerland ’s, has about 60 companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the most of any country outside North America after China. Israel’s stock market was upgraded to developed market status by MSCI Inc. in May 2010, the same month the 63-year-old country was accepted to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Stocks in the Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index trade at 13 times trailing earnings, compared with a historical average of 27 times. The valuations suggest Israeli stocks are poised for gains, according to Goren of DS Securities & Investments. “There will be a rebound, but it will be very much correlated with global markets,” Goren said. “Companies are trading at ridiculous valuations. The downside now is much more limited.” To contact the reporter on this story: Belinda Cao in New York at  Lcao4@bloomberg.net ; Alexander Cuadros in Sao Paulo at  acuadros@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at  papadopoulos@bloomberg.net",['Belinda CaoAlexer Cuadros'],"Allot, Teva Lead Record Rout on Growth Outlook: Israel Overnight Israeli companies listed in the U.S. posted the biggest quarterly loss on record amid concern that the global economy may be headed for another recession and political risk in the Middle East is worsening.

"Next Facebook May Be Chinese as Sites Innovate, Not Copy",['Edmond Lococo'],2013-03-29 08:37:46,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-29/next-facebook-may-be-chinese-as-sites-innovate-not-copy-1-.html,"Instagram, the photo-sharing app bought by Facebook Inc. (FB) last year, offers special effects that can give pictures a weathered black-and-white cast or retro tints. In Beijing, Xu Chaojun’s PaPa app does that, too. In addition, it lets users attach voice messages that can sound like robots or cats. PaPa notched 10 million downloads in five months from iPhone and Android users and the company released an English-language version, Wave , on Apple Inc. (AAP) ’s iTunes on March 10. Chinese Internet companies, such as Alibaba.com Ltd. (1688) , have been dismissed as imitators of successful U.S. enterprises like EBay Inc (EBAY) (EBAY). Some have been content to profit from their vast home market. Yet Xu’s firm and others aim to compete globally and many Chinese entrepreneurs are improving on the Western products that inspired them, said Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s China operation and founder of venture capital fund Innovation Works. “Innovation, if it’s defined as inventing the light bulb, might still be a stretch for China,” said Lee, who helped fund PaPa. “To be the first to conceive of the next iPhone may be still a little difficult, but the prospect of making a Facebook, a Twitter or an Instagram, I think that is now, for the first time ever, within reach for the Chinese startup.” Success Stories The companies Lee says are closest to that kind of success -- two years away, he predicts -- aren’t exactly startups. He points to WeChat, an instant-message app with 300 million users that’s owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) (700), and Weibo, a Twitter-like microblog with more than 500 million registered accounts, run by Sina Corp. (SINA) Tencent is China ’s largest Internet company by market value, and Sina is listed on the Nasdaq. China’s early Internet companies like Alibaba learned “a lot” from western companies like EBay, Lee said. Alibaba didn’t simply copy any foreign model and came up with its own solutions like payment escrow services to address a lack of consumer credit cards in China, said John Spelich, an Alibaba spokesman. Innovation Works, founded in September 2009, manages $500 million in assets, including funding from YouTube co-founder Steve Chen and Foxconn Technology Group. The fund is based in the Zhongguancun district of northwestern Beijing, China’s equivalent of Silicon Valley. So far, Lee’s invested in roughly 50 companies, with a goal of five success stories a year. While Instagram is available in the country, through app stores including China Mobile Ltd (941) .’s Mobile Market, Facebook isn’t. The Menlo Park, California-based social network, along with Twitter and Google Inc (GOOG) .’s YouTube, are censored and blocked from local users. Instagram hasn’t caught on in China because it was missing a key ingredient for local tastes, which was voice, said PaPa’s Xu. ‘Crowded Environment’ “Chinese people like to use their voices,” Xu said. “You go to a Chinese restaurant and it’s very noisy. You go to an American restaurant and it’s very quiet. We live in a crowded environment so we are used to noise. We like noise.” Intel Corp (INTC) .’s venture fund, Intel Capital , has invested about $670 million in more than 100 Chinese technology companies since 1998. Richard Hsu, managing director of Intel Capital China, said many of the roughly 40 companies in his portfolio have had to develop new business models to succeed. Shanghai-based Uucun , which helps set up and run app stores for more than 300 smartphone makers, gives away its products, making money from ads and promotions embedded in the apps. The ads reach 30 million users and the company has attracted more than $10 million in investment from firms including Intel Capital and Vickers Capital, Uucun Chief Executive Officer Zhang Zhendong said. Financing Access China added 51 million Internet users last year, bringing its total to 564 million. In a speech on March 4, President Xi Jinping urged “boosting innovation-powered development in order to make China an economic heavyweight.” Yet censorship by the government hampers entrepreneurs and keeps China from taking “its rightful place in terms of innovation,” said Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA China, a technology consulting company. Another problem: reduced access to financing abroad. The number of Chinese initial public offerings in the U.S. last year declined to three, less than one-tenth the peak in 2010, as allegations of accounting fraud weakened investor demand. Still, China has become “a fast-paced entrepreneurial launchpad,” Clark said. PaPa’s Xu, 33, said he and Li Xiaobao, 24, finished the first version of their photo- and audio-sharer a month after conception. Xu estimated that PaPa will hit 50 million users this year and 200 million within three years. That would outpace Instagram, which reached 100 million users in February, almost two and a half years after its introduction. PaPa, a 30-employee company based in a reclaimed Mao-era factory, has raised more than $10 million from firms including Innovation Works and Sequoia Capital. It’s already sold its first paid advertisements and Xu said it’ll do even better once he hires a sales team. Yet he’s resisting urges to attempt an IPO. “PaPa now is only at the start of our ambition,” he said.

You go to an American restaurant and it’s very quiet. We live in a crowded environment so we are used to noise. We like noise.” Intel Corp (INTC) .’s venture fund, Intel Capital , has invested about $670 million in more than 100 Chinese technology companies since 1998. Richard Hsu, managing director of Intel Capital China, said many of the roughly 40 companies in his portfolio have had to develop new business models to succeed. Shanghai-based Uucun , which helps set up and run app stores for more than 300 smartphone makers, gives away its products, making money from ads and promotions embedded in the apps. The ads reach 30 million users and the company has attracted more than $10 million in investment from firms including Intel Capital and Vickers Capital, Uucun Chief Executive Officer Zhang Zhendong said. Financing Access China added 51 million Internet users last year, bringing its total to 564 million. In a speech on March 4, President Xi Jinping urged “boosting innovation-powered development in order to make China an economic heavyweight.” Yet censorship by the government hampers entrepreneurs and keeps China from taking “its rightful place in terms of innovation,” said Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA China, a technology consulting company. Another problem: reduced access to financing abroad. The number of Chinese initial public offerings in the U.S. last year declined to three, less than one-tenth the peak in 2010, as allegations of accounting fraud weakened investor demand. Still, China has become “a fast-paced entrepreneurial launchpad,” Clark said. PaPa’s Xu, 33, said he and Li Xiaobao, 24, finished the first version of their photo- and audio-sharer a month after conception. Xu estimated that PaPa will hit 50 million users this year and 200 million within three years. That would outpace Instagram, which reached 100 million users in February, almost two and a half years after its introduction. PaPa, a 30-employee company based in a reclaimed Mao-era factory, has raised more than $10 million from firms including Innovation Works and Sequoia Capital. It’s already sold its first paid advertisements and Xu said it’ll do even better once he hires a sales team. Yet he’s resisting urges to attempt an IPO. “PaPa now is only at the start of our ambition,” he said.

Anglo CEO Seeks $1.3 Billion Cash Gain From Business Review,['Firat Kayakiran'],2013-07-26 16:02:03,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/anglo-american-s-first-half-profit-falls-on-lower-metals-prices.html,"Anglo American Plc (AAL) , the mining company that is reviewing its operations from Australia to Brazil, will target a $1.3 billion gain in annual cash flow and the sale of some assets during an overhaul. Chief Executive Officer Mark Cutifani , who is seeking to complete the study in the next three months, has visited 40 percent of the company’s assets since taking over from Cynthia Carroll in April, he said on a conference call. The company may consider seeking buyers for some of the 15 Anglo assets identified for potential divestment when markets offer “good value,” Cutifani said from London. “I’ve got recommendations to sell some assets, today isn’t a good time to sell,” he said. “We’ll work to fix them and be opportunistic to sell when there’s value. It’s a tough market now.” Anglo’s first-half underlying earnings dropped 28 percent to $1.25 billion from a year earlier, it said, because of lower metal prices. Profit at mining companies has fallen as economic growth slows in China , the largest commodity importer. Anglo last week booked a charge of $189 million for the six months after the price it got for its copper slumped 14 percent. “Decent interim results with ambitious cash uplift plans,” Liberum Capital Ltd. said in a note to investors. “We remain cynical of any massive cost savings management hope to achieve, until they become more identifiable.” Cash ‘Uplift’ Anglo gained 0.1 percent to 1,391 pence by the close in London. It has dropped 26 percent in the past six months, compared with an 11 percent decline for BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Rio Tinto Group’s 17 percent retreat, and Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) ’s drop of 28 percent. Cutifani seeks to achieve the $1.3 billion annual cash flow “uplift” by 2016 through $300 million savings from capital allocations on early stage projects, about $500 million from commercial business and $500 million from organizational restructuring. “There are projects that will be pushed back,” Cutifani said on the call. “The $300 million is not fluffy stuff. It’s been kicked back because they won’t deliver the sort of returns I expect to see in the business. And that reduction will be an ongoing reduction because we’ve changed the way we look at and think about projects.” Anglo has reduced the number of business units to six from 10, it said in a separate statement. “It’s about getting our structure down to something that’s much more manageable, effective, and cut out the bureaucracy,” Cutifani said. Brazil Process Anglo has started a process to sell less than a 50 percent stake in its Minas-Rio iron ore project in Brazil , according to the CEO. “We are open, we are in conversation,” he said. “The next 12 months will demonstrate that we de-risk the project.” The metals producer hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and UBS AG to sell as much as 49.9 percent of the project, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said last month. The plan to sell a stake in Minas-Rio follows the company’s writedown in the value of the $8.8 billion mine, processing plant, pipeline and port terminal by $4 billion. First shipments are scheduled to start late in 2014 after years of delays and budget increases. Even with the review, Anglo will still be a diversified mining company a year from now, Cutifani said. “We like the commodity spread that we have and see potential to make good returns across the business,” he said on the conference call. “At the asset level, that’s where the issues are.” South Africa Anglo’s platinum operations, chiefly in South Africa , are an undervalued business, Cutifani said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Anglo, which has 45 percent of its business in the country, including Anglo American Platinum Ltd., the biggest producer, needs to “reframe” its relationship with South Africa after operating there for 80 years, Cutifani said in the interview. “The thing for us going forward is how do we make sure we both do the right thing by our stakeholders, and certainly that will be the central point of what I’ve got to do over the next 12 months in working with the government -- making sure we’ve got the balance right.” Amplats, as the Johannesburg-based platinum producer is known, plans to cut 6,000 jobs, idle three shafts and reduce annual output by 350,000 ounces. About 5,600 South African workers at unit Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the world’s biggest producer of the metal, this month went on strike demanding that suspended union officials be reinstated. Anglo’s current operating model isn’t effective and needs to change to a more industrial approach, he said during the interview. The company will have to increase the rate at which it meets budget targets to 80 percent, from just 11 percent now, he said earlier. “That’s the minimum we should be expecting,” he told reporters. “To go from 11 percent to 80 percent or better than 75 percent success rate means we have to run the operations differently to what we’ve been doing.” To contact the reporter on this story: Firat Kayakiran in London at  fkayakiran@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: John Viljoen at  jviljoen@bloomberg.net",['Firat Kayakiran'],"Anglo CEO Seeks $1.3 Billion Cash Gain From Business Review Anglo American Plc (AAL) , the mining company that is reviewing its operations from Australia to Brazil, will target a $1.3 billion gain in annual cash flow and the sale of some assets during an overhaul.

Airbus Lifts A380 Deliveries to Record in Bid to Meet Target,['Andrea Rothman' 'Robert Wall'],2012-11-12 11:30:11,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/airbus-lifts-a380-deliveries-to-record-in-bid-to-meet-target.html,"Airbus SAS said it delivered a record five of its A380 jets in October as it struggles to meet a full-year target of handing over 30 of its flagship aircraft. The planemaker, based in Toulouse, delivered 22 A380s in the first 10 months, out of a total 462 aircraft that were handed over to customers in the period, it said in a statement. Airbus’s total deliveries touched a year-high of 57 last month. Deliveries of A380s have lagged as Airbus resolves a wing-fault. Boeing Co. (BA) , which has lagged behind Airbus deliveries since 2003, appears likely to become No. 1 again in 2012 for number of planes handed over. Airbus is projecting deliveries of about 580 planes while Boeing is planning 585 to 600. Boeing has already delivered 486 through October. Orders in the first 10 months totaled 460 planes, less than one-half of Boeing’s 1,012 orders. October alone brought 23 new bookings, with two cancelations for A320s. That brings the total cancellation figure to 57 for the year so far. Airbus’s tally leaves it with only two months to meet its stated goal of winning contracts for 650 planes in 2012. Airbus had largely expected to lag Boeing because the European planemaker began offering single-aisle planes with new engines almost a year before its U.S. rival, meaning the big wave of orders for the re-engined planes came in 2011.

Brazil Analysts Cut 2013 Year-End Selic Call for Third Week,['Matthew Malinowski'],2012-11-12 10:51:29,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/brazil-analysts-cut-2013-year-end-selic-call-for-third-week-1-.html,"Analysts covering Brazil lowered their forecast for the benchmark rate at year-end 2013 for the third straight week, as the economy struggles to gain speed in response to government stimulus measures. Brazil’s Selic rate will be 7.25 percent at the end of next year, according to the median estimate in a central bank survey of about 100 analysts published today. Analysts had forecast a 2013 Selic of 7.63 percent the previous week. This week marks the first time economists have predicted the central bank will hold the rate steady for all of next year. President Dilma Rousseff’s administration has broadened measures aimed at helping consumers and companies in the world’s second-largest market. Since August 2011, the central bank has reduced the Selic rate more than any other G-20 nation to a record low 7.25 percent. Policy makers have also increased public spending, implemented tax cuts worth 45 billion reais ($22 billion) and pressured banks to lower lending rates to spur consumer demand. Economists in the survey maintained their forecast for gross domestic product growth this year and next at 1.54 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Industrial Output Some sectors of the economy have been slow to respond to the stimulus measures. Brazil ’s industrial production in September fell for the first time in 4 months, as companies reduced machine and equipment investments. Consumer default rates in September remained at the highest level since November 2009 despite near record-low rates on bank loans. Still, vehicle sales jumped 18.6% in October over the month prior, as consumers took advantage of tax reductions, car dealership association Anfavea said last week. President Rousseff’s economic team forecasts that the economy expanded the fastest in more than two years in the third quarter, at a 5 percent to 6 percent annualized pace, a government official said on Oct. 23. Inflation rose in October at the fastest yearly pace since February on food supply shocks. Keeping the benchmark Selic rate unchanged for a “prolonged time” is the best strategy to ensure inflation will slow to target next year, central bank President Alexandre Tombini said in an interview on Nov. 7. The bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points. Economists in the survey predicted inflation of 5.46 percent this year, up from the previous week’s estimate of 5.44 percent. “Our projections are still valid: the convergence of inflation to the mid-point of the target in the third quarter of next year with this monetary policy strategy,” Tombini said.

"SAC’s Cohen Traded on Horvath’s Dell Inside Tip, SEC Says",['Patricia Hurtado'],2013-07-20 04:01:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/sac-capital-s-cohen-got-traded-on-horvath-s-dell-tip-sec-says.html,"SAC Capital Advisors LP founder Steven A. Cohen traded on tips about Dell Inc. (DELL) obtained by analyst Jon Horvath from a company insider in August 2008, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said. The SEC filed an administrative action against Cohen yesterday, accusing him of failing to properly supervise employees at his Stamford , Connecticut-based hedge fund, which has been the focus of a federal insider-trading probe. In the filing, the SEC said that on Aug. 26, 2008, two days before Dell was to report earnings, Horvath warned SAC portfolio manager Michael Steinberg in an e-mail that one of his sources said the computer-maker’s gross margins would be lower than analysts had expected. “I have a 2nd hand read from someone at the company -- this is 3rd quarter I have gotten this read from them and it has been very good in the last two quarters,” Horvath said in the e-mail, which also included a detailed list of reasons that provide Dell operating expenses and revenue. He then added, “Please keep to yourself as obviously not well known.” While the SEC didn’t file an insider-trading lawsuit against Cohen, the agency’s administrative action alleges he sold off more than $11 million in Dell stock within minutes of getting a copy of a “highly suspicious” e-mail by Horvath and Steinberg. The SEC action also shows that the U.S. has amassed more evidence against Cohen, including telephone toll records and e-mails, than was previously known. Federal Indictment In March, Steinberg was indicted by federal prosecutors in New York for insider trading in Dell in these August 2008 trades, making an illicit profit of $1 million based on Horvath’s tip. Steinberg has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go to trial in November while Horvath has pleaded guilty to funneling illicit tips to SAC fund managers and is cooperating with Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s crackdown on insider trading. While the U.S. previously presented Horvath’s e-mail at a federal criminal insider-trading trial in December, showing that he was consulted on the Dell trade, this is the first time the U.S. has said Cohen got a copy of the Horvath e-mail and traded on its contents. The SEC doesn’t say Cohen was aware that Horvath’s information was improperly obtained, only that he was a recipient of the analyst’s “highly suspicious e-mail which reflected the clear possibility that Steinberg and Horvath were unlawfully in possession of material nonpublic information,” the SEC alleged. Vacation Home According to the SEC, Cohen was working from his vacation home on New York’s Long Island on Aug. 25 and 26th when Horvath and Steinberg realized he was holding a long position in Dell that was contrary to the information Horvath was getting from an insider at the Round Rock , Texas-based computer maker. Cohen had begun purchasing Dell stock on the morning of Aug. 25, 2008, and eventually held 450,000 shares at a cost of more than $11 million, the SEC alleged. After Horvath received an e-mail alerting him that Cohen’s position was contrary to Steinberg’s, Horvath notified the fund manager, “Steve is long Dell,” regulators said. Steinberg and the analyst discussed whether to tell Cohen their view on Dell. Dell Shares By 9:31 a.m. on Aug. 26, Cohen held 500,000 Dell shares, the agency alleged. At 1:29 p.m., an SAC employee forwarded Horvath’s e-mail to Cohen on the phone and 10 minutes later, Cohen began selling off Dell stock, regulators said. By 3:49 p.m., Cohen had dumped his entire Dell position, the SEC alleged. While there is no evidence that Cohen knew Horvath had illicitly obtained the information, the SEC said, Cohen was “looped into a highly suspicious e-mail” and “failed to take prompt action to determine whether an employee under his supervision was engaged in unlawful conduct.” Horvath’s e-mail first emerged at the trial of two fund managers who were arrested and charged with being part of a group of portfolio managers, analysts and insiders at technology companies that funneled nonpublic information to each other. Guilty Pleas Of the eight people charged by the U.S. in the scheme, six have pleaded guilty to insider trading and are cooperating with the U.S. Two fund managers who went to trial, Level Global Investors LP co-founder Anthony Chiasson and former Diamondback Capital Management LLC portfolio manager Todd Newman , were convicted by a federal jury in New York of securities fraud and conspiracy. Newman was sentenced to 4 1/2 years in prison while Chiasson was sentenced to 6 1/2 years. Both are free pending appeal. “The SEC’s administrative proceeding has no merit,” Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC, said in a statement yesterday. “ Steve Cohen acted appropriately at all times and will fight this charge vigorously. The SEC ignores SAC’s exceptional supervisory structure, its extensive compliance policies and procedures, and Steve Cohen’s strong support for SAC’s compliance program.” Barry Berke, a lawyer for Steinberg, and Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for Bharara, declined to comment on the SEC’s administrative action. The criminal case against Steinberg is U.S. v. Steinberg, 12-cr-00121, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Cohen traded on tips about Dell Inc. (DELL) obtained by analyst Jon Horvath from a company insider in August 2008, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said. The SEC filed an administrative action against Cohen yesterday, accusing him of failing to properly supervise employees at his Stamford , Connecticut-based hedge fund, which has been the focus of a federal insider-trading probe. In the filing, the SEC said that on Aug. 26, 2008, two days before Dell was to report earnings, Horvath warned SAC portfolio manager Michael Steinberg in an e-mail that one of his sources said the computer-maker’s gross margins would be lower than analysts had expected. “I have a 2nd hand read from someone at the company -- this is 3rd quarter I have gotten this read from them and it has been very good in the last two quarters,” Horvath said in the e-mail, which also included a detailed list of reasons that provide Dell operating expenses and revenue. He then added, “Please keep to yourself as obviously not well known.” While the SEC didn’t file an insider-trading lawsuit against Cohen, the agency’s administrative action alleges he sold off more than $11 million in Dell stock within minutes of getting a copy of a “highly suspicious” e-mail by Horvath and Steinberg. The SEC action also shows that the U.S. has amassed more evidence against Cohen, including telephone toll records and e-mails, than was previously known. Federal Indictment In March, Steinberg was indicted by federal prosecutors in New York for insider trading in Dell in these August 2008 trades, making an illicit profit of $1 million based on Horvath’s tip. Steinberg has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go to trial in November while Horvath has pleaded guilty to funneling illicit tips to SAC fund managers and is cooperating with Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s crackdown on insider trading. While the U.S. previously presented Horvath’s e-mail at a federal criminal insider-trading trial in December, showing that he was consulted on the Dell trade, this is the first time the U.S. has said Cohen got a copy of the Horvath e-mail and traded on its contents. The SEC doesn’t say Cohen was aware that Horvath’s information was improperly obtained, only that he was a recipient of the analyst’s “highly suspicious e-mail which reflected the clear possibility that Steinberg and Horvath were unlawfully in possession of material nonpublic information,” the SEC alleged.

Copper Analysts Join Hedge Funds in Bet on Decline: Commodities,['Nicholas Larkin'],2013-03-29 14:14:09,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-29/copper-analysts-join-hedge-funds-in-bet-on-decline-commodities.html,"Copper analysts are the most bearish in 12 weeks as the metal extends its worst start to a year in more than a decade on mounting concern that a supply glut will build as economies weaken. Nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices to fall next week. Five forecast gains and four were neutral, making the proportion of bears the highest since Jan. 4. Prices reached an almost seven-month low of $7,486.25 a metric ton March 19. Hedge funds are holding the biggest ever bet on a decline, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data that begins in 2006 show. Global copper inventories are already at a nine-year high and delays to Cyprus’s bailout prompted worries among investors that Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen. China tightened curbs on the property market this month to moderate prices. The nation’s manufacturing expanded at the slowest pace in five months in February and retail-sales growth slipped. Europe and China account for about 60 percent of the world’s copper consumption. “People built up big stockpiles in anticipation of a much stronger economic recovery than the one we’re actually seeing,” said Julian Jessop , chief international economist at Capital Economics Ltd. in London. “There’s nervousness about financial markets and a lack of risk appetite. Even if demand does pick up, it can be met by existing stocks.” Copper Price Copper fell 4.9 percent to $7,540 on the London Metal Exchange this year, the worst start since 2001. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities added 1.3 percent and the MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD) of equities rose 5.9 percent. Treasuries fell 0.3 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows. Speculators have been getting more bearish for the past five weeks and held a net-short position of 25,719 futures and options as of March 19, CFTC data show. They held a net-long position of 24,531 contracts in December as prices headed for a 4.4 percent annual gain. Stockpiles in warehouse monitored by the LME, the largest metals bourse, surged 78 percent since the start of January after dropping the past three years. Inventories monitored by the exchange and those in Shanghai and New York stand at about 886,531 tons, the most since November 2003 and equal to about four months of North American demand. Copper fell for a second straight monthly drop as the 17- nation euro area remains mired in recession and Cyprus’s 10 billion-euro ($13 billion) bailout weighed on confidence. The island nation is the fifth country to seek a rescue since the euro crisis began in 2009. Unemployment in Germany , the region’s biggest economy, unexpectedly rose in March, the Nuremberg-based Federal Labor Agency said yesterday. China’s Growth China’s economy grew 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter. Expansion will accelerate to 8.3 percent in the second quarter before slowing through the end of the year, according to the median estimate of as many as 36 economists compiled by Bloomberg. Chinese refined copper imports slumped 12 percent in February to the lowest in 19 months, customs data show. Growth in the nation’s copper usage will still accelerate to 8 percent this year, from 3 percent in 2012, and stockpiles of the metal in the country will decline in the next several months, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a March 27 report. The bank expects prices to rise to $9,000 in six months. The International Monetary Fund is predicting global growth of 3.5 percent in 2013, from 3.2 percent in 2012. Global equities are near the highest since June 2008 on mounting optimism that the American economy is strengthening. Sales of new U.S. houses in February capped the best back-to-back months in more than four years, Commerce Department data show. Construction accounts for about 40 percent of consumption, the Copper Development Association estimates. Receding Glut Demand will outpace supply by 269,000 tons in the six months through September, cutting this year’s glut to 92,000 tons, Barclays Plc estimates. That’s down from a 142,000-ton surplus in 2012. There are already signs of more demand, with orders to withdraw the metal from LME warehouses jumping almost fourfold since March 6 to the highest since April. There are also risks to supply. Workers at Codelco, the world’s largest copper miner, plan a 24-hour strike within the next month, a labor union leader said March 15. Exports may slow amid a port strike in northern Chile , the top producer, which started March 16. Price Drop Copper closed below its 200-day moving average every day since Feb. 28. The decline in prices is an opportunity to buy and the record bearish position of speculators means there’s a potential for a short squeeze, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) said in a report this week. A short squeeze refers to the forced covering of bets on losses as a market moves higher. In other commodities, three of nine people surveyed expect raw sugar to rise and the same amount predicted a drop. The commodity slid 9.5 percent to 17.66 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York this year. Fifteen of 21 people surveyed anticipate higher corn prices next week and five said the grain will drop, while 14 of 21 said soybeans will climb and four expect lower prices. Fourteen of 19 traders predicted gains in wheat and two were bearish. Corn fell 0.4 percent to $6.9525 a bushel in Chicago this year as soybeans retreated 0.3 percent to $14.0475 a bushel. Wheat declined 12 percent to $6.8775 a bushel. Seventeen of 32 traders and analysts surveyed said gold would rise next week, nine were bearish and six predicted little change. Bullion fell 4.7 percent to $1,596.55 an ounce in London this year after advancing the previous 12 years, the longest run of gains in at least nine decades. Metals Index Natural gas and cotton are among this year’s best performers in the S&P GSCI gauge of raw materials, while lead and zinc are among the worst. The LMEX (LMEX) index of industrial metals is down 5.6 percent this year and set for the first back- to-back monthly decline since 2011. The measure slid 9.2 percent in 2012’s second quarter and is 5.4 percent above the two-year low set in August. “Base metals are still all about China, with Europe in the deep freezer and the pick-up in U.S. housing activity not really having a great impact,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in Copenhagen. “I see a potential repeat of last year with some second-quarter weakness testing the lows from the second quarter last year but that should probably be it before a recovery begins after the summer .” To contact the reporter on this story: Nicholas Larkin in London at  nlarkin1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Claudia Carpenter at  ccarpenter2@bloomberg.net",['Nicholas Larkin'],"Copper Analysts Join Hedge Funds in Bet on Decline: Commodities Copper analysts are the most bearish in 12 weeks as the metal extends its worst start to a year in more than a decade on mounting concern that a supply glut will build as economies weaken.

The first target in what Holder says may become a multi-state effort is Texas. In the face of strong objections from the state’s top officials, the Justice Department will ask a federal court to require Texas to obtain approval from the government or a federal court before making voting-law changes. “It’s very significant, but not at all surprising,” Dan Tokaji , a law professor who focuses on election law and voting rights at Ohio State University ’s Moritz College Law. “It’s best viewed as a Band-Aid rather than an inoculation, which is what the old regime was.” Holder, the country’s first black attorney general who aides say was deeply concerned about the court’s ruling, has been telegraphing that the administration will use all remaining tools to push back on state laws it finds discriminatory. His action yesterday puts the Justice Department behind a lawsuit filed by civil rights groups in federal court in Texas and comes as several states are responding to the high courts ruling with proposals that would add voting restrictions. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said in a conference call with reporters that the state would fight Holder’s effort. State officials announced shortly after the Supreme Court ruling that a state law imposing new identification requirements for voters would take effect.

"America Movil, DirecTV Face Brazil Rules on Pay-TV Quality",['Carla Simoes' 'David Biller'],2012-09-19 20:45:37,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/america-movil-directv-may-face-brazil-rules-on-pay-tv-quality.html,"America Movil SAB (AMXL) and DirecTV, Brazil’s biggest pay-television providers, may be required to show regulators their investment plans and goals to improve quality in a government plan under consideration. Anatel, as the nation’s telecommunications regulator is known, expects to meet with satellite and cable-TV carriers next week to discuss ways to reduce user complaints, which have surged in the past year, said Joao Rezende, the agency’s president. Anatel aims to improve service quality and the attention customers receive through call centers, he said. The plan is part of a government push to more closely monitor telecommunications services as they become widely adopted. Anatel instituted an 11-day ban on the sale of some mobile-phone subscriptions in July to address network failures and customer complaints. “This is an alert for a growing industry,” Rezende said yesterday in a telephone interview from Brasilia. “Many of these new subscribers are from lower classes and are just arriving to this pay-TV market, a whole new world for them.” Under stable economic conditions, Brazilian pay-TV subscriptions will more than double to 35 million subscribers by 2018, Rezende said. The nation had 14.8 million pay-TV clients at the end of July, a gain of 31 percent from a year earlier, according to Anatel data. Biggest Carriers America Movil , based in Mexico City, held about 55 percent of Brazil’s pay-TV market at the end of last year through its Net Servicos and Embratel units, according to Anatel. El Segundo, California-based DirecTV (DTV) ’s Sky service had about 30 percent of the market. America Movil rose 0.4 percent to 16.50 pesos at the close in Mexico City trading. DirecTV gained 0.4 percent to $53.64 in New York. Darris Gringeri, a spokesman with DirecTV, and an America Movil official didn’t return phone and e-mail messages seeking comment. Telefonica Brasil SA (VIVT4) , a unit of Madrid-based Telefonica SA (TEF) and Brazil’s biggest wireless company, has fallen 7 percent in Sao Paulo trading since July 13, when a government official said Anatel would ban the sale of some wireless subscriptions, indicating the government was scrutinizing the industry more closely. No. 2 carrier Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) , a division of Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , is down 17.5 percent in that span. America Movil, controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim , has declined 7 percent. Rio de Janeiro-based Oi SA (OIBR4) , partially controlled by Portugal Telecom SGPS SA (PTC) , has fallen 12 percent. ’Unloved Staples’ Telecommunications equities in Latin America remain “unloved staples” that provide opportunities for investors, and their valuations in Brazil already reflect some of the country’s inherent regulatory risks, said Adam Kutas, manager of Fidelity Investments’ Latin America fund, without identifying specific companies. “In this environment where there is a lot more investor uncertainty given some of the policy responses in other sectors, people have been kind of gun shy and selling quite aggressively,” Kutas, who manages about $2.59 billion in the fund, said in a telephone interview on Aug. 31. Telecommunications stocks in Latin America  made up 15.6 percent of the fund’s total holdings as of Sept. 17, compared with 8.4 percent in the MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America benchmark index, according to a Bloomberg estimate based on a July 31 regulatory filing and subsequent price changes. The fund has provided a return of 5.3 percent over the past three years, the period during which Kutas has managed the fund, compared with 4.6 percent in the benchmark index, and better than 73 percent of its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Anatel, as the nation’s telecommunications regulator is known, expects to meet with satellite and cable-TV carriers next week to discuss ways to reduce user complaints, which have surged in the past year, said Joao Rezende, the agency’s president. Anatel aims to improve service quality and the attention customers receive through call centers, he said. The plan is part of a government push to more closely monitor telecommunications services as they become widely adopted. Anatel instituted an 11-day ban on the sale of some mobile-phone subscriptions in July to address network failures and customer complaints. “This is an alert for a growing industry,” Rezende said yesterday in a telephone interview from Brasilia. “Many of these new subscribers are from lower classes and are just arriving to this pay-TV market, a whole new world for them.” Under stable economic conditions, Brazilian pay-TV subscriptions will more than double to 35 million subscribers by 2018, Rezende said. The nation had 14.8 million pay-TV clients at the end of July, a gain of 31 percent from a year earlier, according to Anatel data. Biggest Carriers America Movil , based in Mexico City, held about 55 percent of Brazil’s pay-TV market at the end of last year through its Net Servicos and Embratel units, according to Anatel. El Segundo, California-based DirecTV (DTV) ’s Sky service had about 30 percent of the market. America Movil rose 0.4 percent to 16.50 pesos at the close in Mexico City trading. DirecTV gained 0.4 percent to $53.64 in New York. Darris Gringeri, a spokesman with DirecTV, and an America Movil official didn’t return phone and e-mail messages seeking comment. Telefonica Brasil SA (VIVT4) , a unit of Madrid-based Telefonica SA (TEF) and Brazil’s biggest wireless company, has fallen 7 percent in Sao Paulo trading since July 13, when a government official said Anatel would ban the sale of some wireless subscriptions, indicating the government was scrutinizing the industry more closely. No. 2 carrier Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) , a division of Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , is down 17.5 percent in that span. America Movil, controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim , has declined 7 percent. Rio de Janeiro-based Oi SA (OIBR4) , partially controlled by Portugal Telecom SGPS SA (PTC) , has fallen 12 percent. ’Unloved Staples’ Telecommunications equities in Latin America remain “unloved staples” that provide opportunities for investors, and their valuations in Brazil already reflect some of the country’s inherent regulatory risks, said Adam Kutas, manager of Fidelity Investments’ Latin America fund, without identifying specific companies. “In this environment where there is a lot more investor uncertainty given some of the policy responses in other sectors, people have been kind of gun shy and selling quite aggressively,” Kutas, who manages about $2.59 billion in the fund, said in a telephone interview on Aug. 31.

Annaly Falls After Offer for Crexus to Counter Fed Influence,['Jody Shenn'],2012-11-12 22:08:29,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/annaly-rises-after-offer-for-crexus-to-counter-fed-encroachment.html,"Annaly Capital Management Inc.

India Stocks Fall Most in 3 Weeks as Govt Ally to Exit Co,['Santanu Chakraborty'],2012-09-20 11:45:58,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/indian-adrs-two-day-retreat-reveal-reform-concerns.html,"Indian stocks declined the most in three weeks, tracking losses in Asian equities, after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ’s largest ally said it was exiting the coalition over reforms announced last week. The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell 0.8 percent to 18,349.25 at the close, its steepest decline since Aug. 29. Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s largest refining complex, retreated to a one-week low. ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the third-biggest lender by value, dropped the most in two weeks. Singh unveiled last week the biggest policy overhaul of his second term by ending a 14-month freeze in diesel prices to lower the government’s fiscal deficit and allowing more foreign investment in aviation and retail sectors. The moves pushed up the Sensex to a 14-month high on Sept. 17. Trinamool Congress ministers will be pulled from the federal cabinet on Sept. 21, party leader Mamata Banerjee said Sept. 18, allowing a few days that could be a window for compromise. “There is a bit of political instability and there is always a worry this government may not be able to complete its full term,” Nirmal Jain, chairman of Mumbai-based brokerage IIFL Ltd. (IIFL) , told Bloomberg TV India today. “The markets have turned cautious and will consolidate at current levels.” The MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) slid 1.1 percent, the most since July 23, as the Shanghai Composite Index declined to the lowest since February 2009. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.3 percent as euro-area services and factory output declined to a 39-month low in September, and China ’s manufacturing probably contracted for an 11th month, according to data from Markit Economics and HSBC Holdings Plc. ‘Unwarranted Euphoria’ Reliance dropped 2.7 percent to 832.50 rupees, the lowest close since Sept. 13, amid a change in recommendation by Kotak Institutional Equities to “sell” from “reduce.” The broker advised selling into the “unwarranted euphoria” that’s pushed up the stock 10 percent this month. ICICI Bank fell 2.5 percent to 1,022.55 rupees, the sharpest drop since Sept. 5. Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. (PF) , the nation’s top supermarket operator, fell 2.9 percent to 174.6 rupees. Budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd. (SJET) decreased 3.4 percent to 36.8 rupees. Losing the backing of Trinamool puts the government about 24 seats short of a majority in the lower house of Parliament, though Singh’s administration has in the past won expressions of support from other groups in the legislature. The proposal to allow foreign investment in retailers stalled in December amid opposition from Trinamool. ‘Brink of Defeat’ Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have threatened to lower the nation’s credit rating as the government struggled to implement policies to revive investment. The economy grew 5.5 percent in the June quarter, near the slowest pace in three years. Growth could ease to 5 percent annually if the policy paralysis persists, Singh said on Sept. 15. “We’re going to see the investment cycle become very difficult because of this particular development,” Raamdeo Agrawal, joint managing director at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. in Mumbai, told Bloomberg TV India today. “The government is almost on the brink of getting defeated.” Last week’s announcements drove foreign funds to invest a net $951 million on Sept. 14 and 17, the biggest two-day net purchases of Indian (SENSEX) equities in almost nine months. They bought a net $201.1 million of shares on Sept. 18, the ninth straight day of purchase, data from the market regulator show. The market was closed yesterday for a public holiday. The Sensex has climbed 19 percent this year after offshore investors bought a net $14 billion of stocks, the most among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg outside China. The 30-stock measure trades at 14.5 times estimated profit , more than the MSCI Emerging Markets Index’s 11.2 multiple, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Indian gauge’s valuation is still below its 2012 high of 16.2 reached in February. Citigroup Inc. (C) raised its June 2013 target for the Sensex by 8 percent to 19,900 on prospects of increased foreign flows, and Deutsche Bank AG increased its year-end forecast for the gauge by 11 percent to 20,000, the brokerages said in notes to clients on Sept. 17. The S&P CNX Nifty (NIFTY) Index fell 0.8 percent to 5,554.25 and its September futures settled at 5,560.50. The BSE-200 Index dropped 0.7 percent.

China Cuts Fuel Prices 1st Time Since July as Crude Drops,['Bloomberg News'],2012-11-16 02:35:37,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/china-cuts-fuel-prices-1st-time-since-july-as-crude-drops.html,"China cut gasoline and diesel prices for the first time since July, threatening to reduce processing margins for refiners in the world’s second-biggest oil-consuming nation. The maximum at which gasoline can be sold to motorists falls by 310 yuan ($50) a metric ton and diesel by 300 yuan starting today, the National Development and Reform Commission said on its website yesterday. The pump price of 90-RON, China III gasoline in Beijing will decline 3.1 percent to 9,730 yuan a ton, or $4.46 a U.S. gallon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from the NDRC. The China III specification is similar to the Euro III fuel standard. Brent crude has dropped 6.5 percent since fuel prices were last revised Sept. 11. The cut, which follows increases in August and September, may hinder efforts by China’s oil companies to curb losses from selling fuel at state-controlled prices. PetroChina Co., the nation’s second-biggest refiner, reduced its processing loss in the first nine months of this year by 11.5 billion yuan from the same period in 2011 to 30 billion yuan, it said Oct. 30. China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , Asia’s biggest refiner known as Sinopec, didn’t give a figure for its refining unit as it posted a total third-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates. “Sinopec will still be able to make a profit from refining after the price cut, though the margin will be close to its break-even point,” Shi Yan, a Shanghai-based energy analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., said by telephone. “The price cut is within market expectations.” Share Prices Sinopec fell 10 cents, or 1.3 percent, to HK$7.75 at 10:04 a.m. in Hong Kong, while PetroChina gained 0.2 percent to HK$10.12. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng index gained 0.2 percent. Brent crude, the benchmark price for more than half the world’s oil, was at $107.89 a barrel, down 12 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange today. Prices have dropped 16 percent since reaching a high this year of $128.40 on March 1. Gasoline and diesel costs are set by the NDRC under a system that tracks the 22-day moving average of a basket of crudes comprising Brent, Dubai and Indonesia ’s Cinta. The government may revise fuel rates when the measure changes more than 4 percent from the last adjustment. That figure was reached Nov. 14, the NDRC said in a separate statement yesterday. C1 Energy reported the price cut after the Hong Kong stock market closed and before the official announcement, citing information from two unidentified oil companies. The Shanghai- based commodity researcher, which has previously reported fuel- price adjustments before the government statement, had predicted the revision would happen Nov. 14. It may have been postponed because of the Chinese Communist Party congress, C1 said. The 82 million-member party that has run China since 1949 yesterday announced its fifth generation of leaders, headed by Xi Jinping, who replaces Hu Jintao as general secretary.

Koreans Fret World-Beating Chaebol Destroy Small Business,['Sangwon Yoon'],2012-11-13 08:52:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/s-koreans-fret-world-beating-chaebol-destroys-small-busi.html,"Lee Bok Sun is ready to shut her 28-year-old fruit store in Seoul, after her customers switched to a new hypermarket owned by one of South Korea’s chaebol , the family-controlled business groups that dominate the economy. “My baby brother gave me the money to start this shop to thank me for the years I worked as a seamstress to pay for his college fees,” said Lee, 63, as she counted the day’s earnings from a battered Nike shoe box. “He wouldn’t have gotten his job at a chaebol without that degree, and now I’m being put out of business by the same system I worked so hard to get him into.” Since Lee moved to Seoul to sew clothes at the age of 15, the business empires that include Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and Hyundai Motor Co. have lifted South Korea ’s economy 22 places, to 15th, in the World Bank’s ranking , making their brands household names around the globe. As Koreans prepare to vote for a new president, the spotlight is turning to the cost of success: a widening income gap, struggling small businesses and the highest suicide rate in the developed world. “To outsiders, it may seem like the economy is doing relatively well, but there are people stuck in the cracks of society where chaebol wealth was supposed to trickle down to,” said Kim Woo Chan, a finance professor at Korea University Business School in Seoul. “People realize that the chaebol’s success alone does not create jobs or enliven domestic activity like the government said it would.” New Path South Korea is facing a watershed that Japan reached in the 1980s and China is rapidly approaching -- a point where a country that has tapped an investment-and-exports model to pull the population out of poverty has to find a new path that caters to an increasingly demanding domestic population. That may mean accepting slower growth, said Jaewoo Lee, chief Korea economist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “The era of high single-digit growth based on manufacturing exports has passed,” said Lee. “South Korea is at a crossroads, where a discussion is in order to identify the next stage or framework of economic growth, with more emphasis on services and domestic activity.” South Korea’s presidential hopefuls, led by software mogul Ahn Cheol Soo, who has campaigned to break up the crossholdings to weaken the grip of the controlling families, have tried to win over voters by pledging to rein in big business. Ahn has teamed up with opposition-party nominee Moon Jae In after the two fell behind in the polls to ruling party candidate Park Geun Hye, whose late father Park Chung Hee was responsible for building up the chaebol in the 1960s and 1970s during his time as the country’s longest-serving military dictator. Park Leading Park’s approval rating was 41.5 percent, with Ahn second at 26.6 percent and Moon a close third at 25.3 percent, according to Seoul-based Realmeter’s Nov. 5-11 poll. The survey of 5,250 respondents had a margin of error of 1.4 percentage points. Even Park has tried to distance herself from the chaebol, which are closely tied to her New Frontier Party. “Big businesses aren’t the only ones in the economic ecosystem,” said Park at an Oct. 30 rally for small business owners and independent shopkeepers. “Small and medium-sized enterprises, independent shop owners, the self-employed must all support the ecosystem and nurture it to growth. Nobody should fall behind because of an unfair structure.” Popular support for change has been fueled by the perceived failure of policies of outgoing President Lee Myung Bak , whose single term ends in February. Lee pledged to put the nation of 50 million people on a path that would yield annual growth of 7 percent and per capita income of $40,000 by 2017. Exports Curbed Instead, the U.S. mortgage meltdown that began infecting global markets in 2007, along with debt woes in Europe the past three years, have crimped exports that account for nearly half of the nation’s gross domestic product. Overseas sales have fallen for three of the past four months and the Bank of Korea estimates growth this year will be 2.4 percent. “People are more likely to focus on issues surrounding the distribution of wealth when economic growth slows, especially if businesses’ share is growing,” said Lee at Bank of America. The biggest of the industrial groups touch almost every aspect of South Koreans’ lives, an influence that is magnified for chaebol workers by corporate loyalty and staff discounts. Samsung Electronics sales employee Ellen Jeon, 33, takes the elevator down in the morning from her home in Tower Palace, a 3,070-apartment complex in Seoul’s Gangnam district built 10 years ago by Samsung C&T Corp. (000830) , the original trading company of the Samsung group , founded in 1938. Caramel Macchiato She crosses the lobby to Starbucks, a franchise owned by a unit of retailer Shinsegae Group (004170) that’s run by Samsung Chairman Lee Kun Hee’s nephew, Chung Yong Jin. Wearing her favorite Tory Burch flats, bought at a Shinsegae department store, she carries her caramel macchiato down to the car park to drive her Renault Samsung Motors Co. SM5 sedan to work. Near her home is the Samsung Medical Center, where she gave birth to her first son eight weeks ago, a year after her wedding at Seoul’s five-star Shilla Hotel (008770) , run by Lee’s eldest daughter, Lee Boo Jin. On her way to Samsung Digital City in the southern suburb of Suwon, she passes close to Shinsegae’s Jookjeon outlet, where her husband bought his first suit -- a pinstripe from the Galaxy label of Cheil Industries Inc. (001300) , of which Lee’s second daughter, Lee Seo Hyeon, is vice president. Naturally, Jeon and her husband both carry Samsung phones. Getting Bigger The country’s 10 biggest conglomerates make up more than half the total value of the 1,779 companies on the Korea Stock Exchange. And they continue to grow. In the past four years, the number of companies linked to the top 35 business groups has almost doubled, to nearly 600, according to a February report by the Fair Trade Commission. Exports by the 30 largest chaebol accounted for 84 percent of South Korea’s overseas shipments in 2010, according to the Federation of Korean Industries. At the same time, those 30 employed just 6 percent of the nation’s workforce, while corporate tax paid by groups with more than 100 billion won ($92 million) in sales amounted to 12 percent of the total tax collected in 2010, according to the National Tax Service. Still, the economic importance of global brands like Samsung, Hyundai and LG Electronics Inc. (066570) means that, electioneering aside, any progress in dismantling the chaebol structure is likely to be slow, according to a September report from CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets Ltd. and the Hong Kong-based Asian Corporate Governance Association. Toned Down “The most aggressive policies will be toned down due to practical constraints and the importance of the chaebol to the economy,” Shaun Cochran , head of Korea research for CLSA, wrote in this year’s annual report of corporate governance. “However, investors should make no mistake; there is a clear push to reduce the ability of families to exploit control of companies.” Park Chung Hee provided chaebol with subsidies such as unlimited cheap credit, protection from foreign competition and tax breaks. In the seven years before his assassination in 1979, he introduced policies to encourage them to take over smaller companies, to “rid” the economy of “unsound” businesses. Park had near-total control of financial resources and credit in the country, a legacy of the state’s acquisition of the colonial-Japanese banking system after World War II. Money was channeled into industrialization and building an education system that fed the need for engineers and technical graduates in industries such as shipbuilding, electronics and automaking. Last year, South Korea’s 30 biggest business groups hired more than 80 percent of the 320,000 new college graduates. Circular Holdings As the groups grew and moved into more businesses, complex, circular shareholding structures developed, with relatives of the chairman installed in major affiliates, ensuring the families kept control, even with minority shareholdings. Chung Mong Koo is chairman of Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) He’s a son of the late Chung Ju Yung, who is a symbol of South Korea’s industrial transformation -- rising from a poor farming family in what is now North Korea to build a group that spawned the world’s largest shipbuilder and fifth-largest carmaker. Hyundai Motor, which split from the Hyundai Group in 2000, is 20.8 percent owned by its parts supplier Hyundai Mobis (012330) , which in turn is 16.9 percent owned by Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , which has 33.9 percent of its equity held by Hyundai Motor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from the latest figures published in April by the nation’s Fair Trade Commission. Steel Suppliers Including other family stakes and affiliate crossholdings - - a similar circular structure exists with Hyundai Motor, Kia and their steel suppliers Hyundai Hysco Co. and Hyundai Steel Co. (004020) -- Chung is able to retain control of the entire auto group with a 5.2 percent stake in Hyundai Motor and 7 percent of Mobis. To dismantle this structure and rearrange Hyundai Motor Group into a vertical structure of parent and subsidiaries would cost 10.8 trillion won, according to Chaebul.com, which tracks the wealth of the nation’s richest families. Failing to do so may reinforce concerns about the nation’s corporate governance that contribute to the so-called Korea Discount in the stock market. The benchmark Kospi (KOSPI) stock index trades at 8.3 times next year’s earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest of Asia’s 10 biggest equity markets. It’s not the first time the government has been under pressure to rein in the chaebol. The 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, which led the country to accept a bailout from the International Monetary Fund , raised criticism amid the collapse of the Daewoo and Hanbo groups. Presidential Pardon In 2008, Hyundai’s Chung Mong Koo was convicted on charges of embezzlement and breach of duty, including the sale of stock in a unit to his son at below-market prices. He received a suspended jail term after promising nearly 1 trillion won to charity and was later pardoned by President Lee. This year, Hanwha Group Chairman Kim Seung Youn, 60, was sentenced to four years in jail and fined 5.1 billion won after a court found that he used funds from the nation’s 10th-largest industrial group to pay debts of private firms owned under false names. Kim, who was granted a presidential pardon in 2008 after striking a man with a steel pipe and threatening others with an electric shock device, has appealed the Aug. 16 ruling. The economic slowdown, scandals, and social criticism have made the chaebol and their ruling families into political pinatas in the presidential election race. Investment Path Front-runner Park said she will increase fines for conglomerates that violate fair-trade laws to as much as 10 times the incurred damage and wants to ban new cross-shareholdings. Moon is calling for a three-year grace period to resolve the question of the cross-holdings as well as the practice of channeling investment funds between affiliates. Ahn, who founded anti-virus software company Ahnlab Inc. (053800) , would incrementally break up the web of affiliates altogether, to sever the family ties and release more capital for smaller businesses. He would also halve holding companies’ current debt ratio of 200 percent and limit their investment in affiliates. South Korea’s gross domestic product may fall by more than 2 percent if tougher regulations restrict chaebol from investing and creating more jobs, said Oh Jung Gun, an economics professor at Korea University, at an Oct. 30 seminar hosted by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, one of the nation’s largest business lobby groups. Many South Koreans are proud of the success of companies like Samsung and Hyundai, which have given the nation global standing and lifted per capita income from $67 in 1953 to $22,489 last year, according to the Bank of Korea. Taste Test “As much as we hate to admit it, the chaebol just run businesses better,” said Hongik University student Kim Seung Kyu, 20, coming out of an 8Seconds fashion store, another Cheil label, clutching a Starbucks iced caramel macchiato. “I like individuality as much as anyone, but let’s be honest, Starbucks tastes better.” Even Lee Bok Sun the fruit-seller said she’s still proud that she managed to get a member of the family into a chaebol. That love-hate relationship may mean that the restructuring of the groups will come slowly, said Charles Lee, North Asia research director for the Asian Corporate Governance Association , in the September report. “Korea’s renewed momentum on corporate governance may lack conviction and could fade once this year’s election passes,” Lee said. “We sense a widely shared fatalism among most Koreans that the reform process can only go so far, because certain features of the current system -- such as the chaebol structure -- are simply accepted as the Korean way of doing business.” Economic Backbone The chaebol are “the backbone of the South Korean economy” and limiting or banning cross-shareholdings would make them vulnerable to hostile foreign takeovers, the Federation of Korean Industries, which represents the nation’s biggest companies, said in an Aug. 6 statement. Samsung Group declined to comment in an e-mailed response. “I don’t think anyone can deny that South Korea’s economy wouldn’t be where it is today without the chaebol,” said Kim Kyung Won, 26, who works in marketing in Seoul and owns an LG phone, Samsung TV and Kia sedan. “But I’m not so sure how positive the current structure will be for the economy in future. I mean, it can’t be healthy to have just a few companies own almost everything, right?” To contact the reporter on this story: Sangwon Yoon in Seoul at syoon32@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Peter Hirschberg at phirschberg@bloomberg.net",['Sangwon Yoon'],"Koreans Fret World-Beating Chaebol Destroy Small Business Lee Bok Sun is ready to shut her 28-year-old fruit store in Seoul, after her customers switched to a new hypermarket owned by one of South Korea’s chaebol , the family-controlled business groups that dominate the economy. “My baby brother gave me the money to start this shop to thank me for the years I worked as a seamstress to pay for his college fees,” said Lee, 63, as she counted the day’s earnings from a battered Nike shoe box. “He wouldn’t have gotten his job at a chaebol without that degree, and now I’m being put out of business by the same system I worked so hard to get him into.” Since Lee moved to Seoul to sew clothes at the age of 15, the business empires that include Samsung Electronics Co.

MBK Said to Mull Singapore IPO for CNS After Sale Blocked,['Joyce Koh' 'Jonathan Browning'],2013-07-19 07:14:23,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/mbk-said-to-mull-singapore-ipo-for-cns-after-taiwan-blocked-sale.html,"MBK Partners Ltd., a private equity firm formed by former Carlyle Group executives, is considering a Singapore initial public offering for Taiwan ’s China Network Systems Co., said two people with knowledge of the matter. Listing Taiwan’s largest cable television operator as a business trust is among options being discussed after a sale to Taiwan’s richest man was blocked this year, said the people, asking not to be identified as the deliberations are private. MBK’s proposed sale of China Network, or CNS, to Want Want China Holdings Ltd. (151) Chairman Tsai Eng Meng for $2.4 billion including debt failed this year as Taiwanese regulators ruled Want Want hadn’t fulfilled conditions for approval. Sellers from Taiwan, India and Hong Kong have completed business-trust IPOs in Singapore since early 2011 as they lured investors with high yields amid record-low interest rates. “The subscriber base and average revenue per user tends to be quite stable so this makes a good candidate for someone like CNS to have a business trust,” said Jonathan Koh, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian in Singapore. “There is a track record of a Taiwanese pay-TV operator listed in Singapore, and that’s something they can rely on.” Asian Pay Television Trust, owner of Taiwan’s third-largest cable television operator, listed in Singapore in May and is down 10 percent from its IPO price. Religare Health Trust (RHT) , which raised S$511 million in its October IPO last year, is down 5 percent from its debut price, while Hutchison Port Holdings Trust (HPHT) , which raised $5.5 billion in March 2011, is down 24 percent. Deal Conditions CNS has more than 1.2 million subscribers in Taiwan, giving it a 20 percent market share according to MBK’s website. MBK and a group led by Tsai initially agreed to a sale of CNS in 2010. After giving conditional approval for the deal in July of last year, Taiwan’s regulators said in February this year that the buyer hadn’t met its requirements. The conditions included converting a Want Want-owned channel to a non-news format and forming a supervisory board to ensure editorial independence. Chao Yu-pei, an assistant to Tsai’s son Shao-chung, said an appeal has been filed with the Taiwanese cabinet and a ruling is expected in September. “We still wish the deal can get approval,” Chao said by telephone today. Michael Kim , MBK’s founding partner, and Liu Chien-chih, a spokesman for CNS, did not reply to messages seeking comment on the IPO plan. APTT Sale MBK Partners, formed in 2005 by five former Carlyle executives led by Kim, agreed in 2006 to buy 60 percent of CNS for NT$30.9 billion ($1 billion). The fund has $6.3 billion of assets under management and oversees 18 portfolio companies including Universal Studios Japan and New China Life Insurance (601336) Co., according to its website. Asian Pay Television Trust raised S$1.39 billion ($1.1 billion) in its May IPO. The sale by the trust, which owns Taiwan Broadband Communications Co., was part of Macquarie International Infrastructure Fund’s planned shutdown. Asian Pay Television Trust (APTT) offered a projected yield of 8.51 percent for 2014, according to its IPO prospectus.

"Online Bettor Intrade Halts Service, Cites Irregularities",['David Fickling' 'Kevin Crowley' 'Joe Brennan'],2013-03-11 13:04:38,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/intrade-halts-service-on-possible-financial-irregularities-probe.html,"Intrade, an online service that lets people bet with one another on events such as elections and the weather, ceased trading activity, saying it is investigating possible financial irregularities. The firm, owned by Dublin-based Trade Exchange Network Ltd., will not make payments to customers from their online accounts while the investigation is in progress, it said in a statement on its website. The service provider has closed and settled all open contracts at fair market value as at the end of March 10, it said. “During the upcoming weeks, we will investigate these circumstances further and determine the necessary course of action,” Intrade said in the statement. The company’s auditors last month expressed concern over payments to the accounts of the firm’s late founder, John Delaney. Intrade allowed customers to bet with one another on binary outcomes of future events such as the possibility of Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana becoming the next Pope. Just as stock exchanges find the price of shares, the so-called prediction market found the probability of an event happening, according to Intrade’s website. The marketplace accurately predicted the results of the U.S. presidential elections in 2008 and 2012 and was used by central banks and Wall Street firms, it said. The company’s statement didn’t give details of any irregularities and said it took the actions in accordance with Irish law. Carl Wolfenden, Intrades’s operations manager, declined to comment when contacted by telephone today. A spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. WorldSpreads Collapse The suspension follows the collapse of London-based spread- betting firm WorldSpreads Group Plc (WSPR) , which shut down last year after directors discovered a 13 million-pound ($19 million) shortfall in client funds. WorldSpreads allowed retail investors to speculate on stocks and commodities without owning the underlying asset and was typically tax-free because it was regulated as gambling rather than investing. Intrade’s auditor, Dublin-based Caulfield Dunne Accountants & Registered Auditors , last month raised concerns about payments made to accounts controlled by Delaney, the company founder who died in May 2011. Delaney died at 42, less than 50 yards (46 meters) from the summit of Mount Everest, the New York Times reported at the time. Auditor’s Report The firm had “insufficient documentation regarding payments made into bank accounts in the name of a deceased former director and other third parties,” the auditor said in the report, signed off on Feb. 4. “We have not obtained all the information and explanations we consider necessary for the purpose of our audit,” it said. The current directors, who were appointed on Nov. 13, were not able to “comment on the maintenance of books and records by the company prior to their appointment,” the report said. Brian Dunne, who signed the Caulfield Dunne audit, declined to comment. Intrade wasn’t regulated by the Irish Central Bank and as such the bank couldn’t comment on the situation, said spokesman Paul Gray. In November, Intrade asked U.S. clients to close their accounts after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued the website for allegedly offering improper options trading. Trade Exchange in 2005 agreed to pay $150,000 to settle allegations it illegally offered contracts in the U.S., including some based on the price of gold, crude oil, the euro and the yen. The market’s most active trades before bidding ceased were over the papal succession and whether the Democratic Party would win the 2016 U.S. presidential election. There were 32,576 open positions at 8:07 p.m. Dublin time on March 10, according to statistics published on its site. Intrade held members’ funds of $5.7 million at Dec. 31, 2011, and had net assets of $1.9 million, according to accounts filed with Ireland’s corporate regulator.

Farmland Seen Returning Up to 12% by U.S. Pensions Manager,['Luzi Ann Javier'],2011-10-06 14:13:52,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/farmland-seen-returning-up-to-12-by-469-billion-fund-manager.html,"Farmland investments may return an average of 8 percent to 12 percent annually as global food demand increases, said the largest U.S. pension manager for teachers and academic researchers with $469 billion of assets. The company has $2.5 billion invested in farmland and owns about 600,000 hectares (1.48 million acres) mostly in the U.S., Brazil and Australia, said Jose Minaya, 40, a managing director and head of natural resources and infrastructure investments at New York-based TIAA-CREF. “From a historical point of view, farmland has generated returns of 8 percent to 12 percent a year and we expect that to continue over the long term,” Minaya said. Farms are attracting investors such as billionaire George Soros as rising incomes in China and India and a growing world population increase demand for food and fuel. Food production will have to climb 70 percent by 2050 as the population rises to 9.2 billion from 6.9 billion in 2010, according to the United Nations. Global food costs reached a record in February after weather ruined crops from Canada to Australia and Russia. The Standard & Poor’s Spot Index of 24 commodities has dropped 21 percent from its April high on concern the European debt crisis would slow growth and curb demand. The gauge had more than doubled since the start of 2009. The MSCI All-Country World Index of global equities lost 22 percent from its May high. ‘Pretty Steady’ Farmland is an asset class that’s “pretty steady” and delivers stable income returns with capital appreciation that tracks slightly above inflation, said Minaya, who previously worked for AIG Global Investment Group and Merrill Lynch & Co. The company is seeking to expand in grain-exporting countries and hold investments for as long as 30 years, he said in an interview Sept. 30. “We can easily be twice the size that we are today” if the right opportunities arise, he said. The pension manager buys land and leases it back to farmers, he said. The investments are in “mature and established” regions, in “the bigger farms” and in countries that export grain, he said. Returns in the past few years have been at the high end of the 8 percent to 12 percent range, he said Sept. 30. “On aggregate, it does look like a pretty good bet,” said Michael Creed , an agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. “We’re entering a period of rapid growth in emerging- market demand for higher protein,” which is increasing use of grains to feed poultry and livestock, he said from Melbourne. Farmland Values TIAA-CREF is one of eight institutional investors representing $1.3 trillion in assets that have endorsed a set of Farmland Principles ranging from environmental sustainability to transparency and respect for land rights, it said on Sept. 6. Farmland values in one of the most-productive regions in the U.S. Midwest soared 17 percent in the second quarter as higher grain prices made real estate more attractive, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said on Aug. 17. The increase from a year ago in the area including Illinois , Indiana , Iowa and Wisconsin was the biggest since the 1970s, it said. A fund controlled by George Soros owns 23 percent of South American farmland venture Adecoagro SA, Bloomberg data show. The company is involved in the production of grains, oilseeds, dairy, sugar, ethanol, coffee, cotton and cattle meat, and has operations in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, its website said. Shrinking land and water supply in countries including China and India, will limit their capacity to boost food production, creating import demand, Minaya said. That’s going to be met by the major exporting regions in North and South America, Australia, and parts of Central and Eastern Europe, he said. As well as the U.S., Australia and Brazil, the company has a smaller level of investments in Poland and Romania , he said.

Phil Anschutz to Sell L.A.-Based Live-Event Promoter AEG,['Andy Fixmer'],2012-09-19 04:00:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/billionaire-anschutz-to-sell-los-angeles-entertainment-unit-1-.html,"Billionaire Philip Anschutz said he plans to sell his Anschutz Entertainment Group, owner of Los Angeles ’ Staples Center and the world’s No. 2 concert promoter. Anschutz Co., AEG’s Denver-based parent, hired Blackstone Advisory Partners to assist with the sale, according to an e- mailed statement yesterday. AEG, based in Los Angeles, is second in the concert business to Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV) , which had a market value of $1.71 billion as of yesterday. AEG has created entertainment districts in London , around the O2 arena, and Los Angeles, where it built Staples, home of the Lakers NBA basketball team and the Kings in hockey. Given its size and global reach, there are few potential buyers, said David Carter , executive director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California. “The number of suitors would be small,” Carter said in an interview. “It’s hard to tell who could step up to this size of a deal.” Led by Chief Executive Officer Tim Leiweke , AEG developed L.A. Live, a hotel and entertainment complex adjacent to Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. In London, the O2 is surrounded by piazzas, bars and restarants as well exhibition space. The company owns and operates 100 venues on five continents, in addition to interests in the Lakers, Kings, and the L.A. Galaxy professional soccer team. The company may fetch several billion dollars, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported the plans yesterday. ‘Entertainment Destinations’ AEG’s proposal to build a $1.2 billion NFL stadium next to Staples Center received city planning approval last week. The company’s formula of combining live sports, theaters and restaurants with real estate development helps create “true entertainment destinations for consumers,” Leiweke said in the statement. A decision to sell may hinder AEG’s plans to attract an NFL team to Los Angeles, causing team owners to question Anschutz’s commitment, Carter said. “They will have to do damage control around the NFL deal,” Carter said. “This will give pause to some NFL owners.” Football Boost? City officials said the sale of AEG may boost efforts to attract an NFL team. “Maybe this means it’s more about football than ever before,” Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jan Perry, whose district includes part of downtown, said in a telephone interview. “This could be a surge ahead. There is a greater emphasis on football than ever before.” In a statement, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said he had received assurances from both Anschutz and Leiweke that a sale “will not affect plans for an NFL team to return to Los Angeles.” AEG produces annual festivals that include the Coachella Music & Arts Festival and the Stagecoach Festival in Indio, California , and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, the company said. Last week, the company formed a venture with Lollapalooza producer C3 Presents to purchase Front Gate Tickets, based in Austin, Texas. Oil, Lodging Anschutz, 72, whose interests range from energy and farming to lodging to cinema chain Regal Entertainment Group (RGC) , is ranked 39th on Forbes magazine’s list of the richest Americans, with wealth estimated at $7 billion. His public holdings include a 78 percent voting stake in Regal Entertainment Group, the nation’s largest cinema chain, that is valued at $1.35 billion, based on the company’s regulatory filings and stock price. Anschutz Corp. has been in the natural resources business for more than 75 years, according to the website of one affiliate, Anschutz Exploration, which lists involvement in projects in Montana , Wyoming , Colorado , New York and Texas. Through its Xanterra Parks & Resorts, the company is the largest operator of lodging, restaurants and retail outlets in U.S. national parks, including at Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. Anschutz Film Group made the movie “Ray” about Ray Charles , and his Clarity Media Group owns the Washington Examiner and The Weekly Standard.

BP’s Putin Meeting Signals Exploration Deal With Rosneft,['Brian Swint'],2012-09-19 16:28:28,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/bp-s-putin-meeting-signals-arctic-exploration-deal-with-rosneft.html,"BP Plc (BP/) talks with President Vladimir Putin indicate that the U.K. oil company may gain access to Russia’s Arctic fields as part of a deal to sell half of its TNK-BP venture to OAO Rosneft. (ROSN)  BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley yesterday spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin about building cooperation with Russian partners, a Kremlin spokesman said. Rosneft has asked banks for as much as $15 billion to finance the purchase of BP’s half of TNK-BP, Russia’s third-largest oil company, according to a person with direct knowledge of the deal. “It looks like the deal will be $15 billion in cash, plus maybe $10 billion in shares and access to the Arctic,” said Stuart Joyner, an analyst at Investec Securities Ltd. in London. “That package would be good for BP. The company’s strongest card was always that it’s a plausible and worthy partner for Rosneft in the Arctic.” BP is recasting its global operations after the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill wiped out a third of its market value. The company has sold more than $32 billion in assets to shore up its balance sheet while it attempts to reach a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and draw a line under the disaster. Dudley said in July that investors should be open to receiving a combination of cash and shares for the TNK-BP stake. Texas City Putin is inviting foreign producers into Russia to help keep the country’s oil output at a post-Soviet high of 10 million barrels a day. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) took BP’s place in a Kara Sea exploration pact that failed last year and also agreed to start drilling shale prospects in Siberia next year. BP is in talks to sell its Texas City , Texas, refinery to Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) for as much as $2.5 billion, the Financial Times reported today, citing people it didn’t identify. BP sold some of its Gulf of Mexico fields to Plains Exploration and Production Co. for $5.55 billion this month. BP rose 1.1 percent to 443.75 pence in London trading. David Nicholas, a company spokesman, declined to comment on the Texas City talks. BP reiterated its long-term commitment to Russia in yesterday’s meeting, said Vladimir Buyanov , a spokesman in Moscow. BP’s June 1 decision to seek a sale of TNK-BP, a 50-50 venture with a group of billionaires, followed a failed share- swap and exploration deal with Rosneft for the Kara Sea in 2011. Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil producer that together with BP had offered to buy out the billionaire partners for $32 billion last year, said in July it was interested in bidding for the stake. Cash and Shares In selling TNK-BP, BP “will look carefully at value,” Dudley said on a July 31 conference call with analysts. “How we do that in terms of combinations, whether it’s all cash or whether it’s shares and cash, far too early to say.” Relations between BP and its partners in the nine-year-old TNK-BP venture have often been fractious. In 2008, Dudley was forced to resign as head of the venture and leave Russia after months of battling between the shareholders over strategy. Mikhail Fridman , one of the billionaires, quit as CEO of TNK-BP this year. He was supposed to stay at helm of the company until the end of 2013. AAR, which represents the partners in TNK-BP, has said they’re interested in buying half of BP’s 50 percent stake. The group blocked the $7.8 billion deal with Rosneft last year in court, arguing that BP was required to pursue all opportunities in Russia exclusively through TNK-BP. Arctic Agenda “If there’s a joint venture with Rosneft, Arctic exploration must be on the agenda,” said Peter Hutton , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London. A Rosneft venture “would be positive but difficult to value. It’s a vehicle for the value of TNK-BP to be realized without taking $30 billion out of the country.” TNK-BP produced 2.04 million barrels of oil and gas a day in the first quarter, and output at Rosneft, Russia ’s largest producer, was about 2.63 million barrels a day. TNK-BP has paid BP $19 billion in dividends since 2003 and accounts for a quarter of the company’s global output. AAR rejected a proposal from the U.K. energy producer for TNK-BP to pay a $1 billion dividend on July 30. TNK hasn’t paid dividends on any 2012 income as it has lacked a functioning board since December. Dudley said July 31 that the plan to sell the stake in TNK- BP doesn’t mean the company intends to leave Russia. “BP hopes to continue to play a role in Russia’s energy sector for many decades to come,” he said.

"Osborne Considers Fuel-Duty Delay, Foiling Labour-Led Revolt",['Gonzalo Vina' 'Kitty Donaldson'],2012-11-12 22:20:36,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/osborne-considers-u-k-fuel-duty-delay-as-labour-pushes-revolt.html,"U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne may delay an increase in duty on gasoline planned for January as the opposition Labour Party sought to provoke a rebellion by Conservative lawmakers over the issue. Labour failed to win parliamentary backing for the delay in a vote in the House of Commons today after lawmakers including Robert Halfon, from the chancellor’s Tory party who last week considered rebelling, said he had received assurances from the Treasury that it will consider a delay. The motion tabled by Labour was defeated by 234-282. “The chancellor may have already made his decision but, if not, I would urge the chancellor to reflect on the contributions made here,” said Conservative lawmaker Martin Vickers during the debate in the House of Commons minutes before the vote. “I shall be supporting the government on the lobby this evening.” Labour lawmaker Ed Balls , the party’s spokesman on Treasury affairs, is using the non-binding motion to demand that Osborne put back from Jan. 1 to April the increase of 3 pence (4.8 U.S. cents) on a liter of gasoline. The increase had been due to take effect in August, before Osborne postponed it in the fourth of a series of policy reversals in June. “I am going to vote with the government” against the Labour motion, Halfon, who last week considered voting with Labour, said in a telephone interview earlier today. He said he believes ministers “are in strong listening mode.” Treasury minister David Gauke said the government will “take action to help” offset the squeeze suffered by households from rising prices. A spokesman from the Treasury, who declined to be named to comply with rules governing public servants, said the government has listened to the concerns of motorists and that it recognizes that the cost of fuel takes up an increasing part of household spending. Both Osborne and Balls were absent from the debate after the signal from the Treasury defused the rebellion. June’s postponement cost the Treasury 550 million pounds and was paid for by savings from government departments. Any further delay would be announced by Osborne in his autumn statement to Parliament on Dec. 5, one of two dates in the parliamentary calendar when he changes tax and spending policy.

Trichet Keeps Banks Afloat as Governments Confront Risk of Greek Default,['Gabi Thesing' 'Jeff Black'],2011-10-07 08:41:21,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/ecb-buys-governments-time-on-banks-as-greece-moves-closer-to-debt-default.html,"The European Central Bank ’s move to keep euro-area banks afloat is buying governments more time to recapitalize them as Greece edges closer to default. The ECB said yesterday it will reintroduce yearlong loans, giving banks access to unlimited cash through January 2013, and resume purchases of covered bonds to encourage lending. At the same time, the European Commission is pushing for a coordinated capital injection into banks and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said policy makers “shouldn’t hesitate” if it turns out financial institutions are undercapitalized. “Politicians, including Angela Merkel, have finally realized the urgency in protecting banks as a Greek default can no longer be ruled out and no-one wants a Lehman in Europe ,” said Christoph Kind, head of asset allocation at Frankfurt Trust, which manages $24 billion. “From its side, the ECB is making sure that banks won’t face funding issues throughout that period.” Financial shares advanced yesterday after Merkel fed speculation that policy makers are working on plans to boost bank capital to stem the spread of the sovereign debt crisis. Europe’s rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, could be relied upon as a last resort to bolster banks if needed, she said, adding that Germany is ready to discuss possible bank aid at this month’s European Union summit. Euro, Stocks The euro headed for a weekly advance after two weeks of losses, trading at $1.3448 at 10:36 a.m. in Frankfurt. Stocks gained for a third day in Europe after the overnight advance in Asia , with the Stoxx 600 up 0.7 percent to 231.8 at 9:00 a.m. in London. European leaders are under pressure from global counterparts to find a solution to the debt crisis as it threatens to tip the world economy back into recession. EU leaders hold a summit on Oct. 18 followed by a meeting of the Group of 20 on Nov. 3-4. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said today he will discuss banks with Merkel when he visits Berlin on Oct. 9. Germany’s Deutsche Bank AG on Oct. 4 scrapped its profit forecast and announced 500 job cuts and further writedowns on Greek bond holdings, while Belgium’s Dexia SA is facing its second bailout in three years. The ECB’s measures buy banks “a lot of time as Europe is basically moving toward recapitalizing the sector,” said Silvio Peruzzo , an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London. “Where the ECB can and does contribute very aggressively is to breaking the nexus between the sovereigns and the banks.” ECB Purchases The ECB will spend 40 billion euros ($53 billion) on covered bonds from next month and offer banks two additional unlimited loans of 12 and 13-month durations, President Trichet said at a press conference in Berlin yesterday after leaving the benchmark interest rate at 1.5 percent. The ECB will continue to lend banks as much money as they need in its regular refinancing operations at least until July 2012. The ECB used the same measures during the global financial crisis to avert a credit crunch. The 2.5 trillion-euro market for covered bonds -- assets backed by mortgages or public-sector loans -- underpins much of Europe’s real estate lending, which almost ground to a halt in the wake of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s collapse in September 2008. Fear Factor Banks’ overnight deposits with the ECB jumped to the most in more than a year this week as concern about other institutions’ sovereign debt holdings discouraged them from lending to each other. “For the banking sector the focus is more on liquidity rather than capital,” UniCredit SpA Chief Executive Officer Federico Ghizzoni said in an interview published yesterday. Policy makers are “determined to do everything necessary to ensure that Europe’s banks are able to play their essential role in lending,” commission President Jose Barroso told reporters in Brussels yesterday. “Close coordination at European level is essential.” Chairing his final rate-setting meeting before handing the reins to Italy’s Mario Draghi at the end of the month, Trichet resisted calls to reverse two rate increases earlier this year even as the debt crisis threatens to tip Europe back into recession. Klaus Baader, co-chief economist at Societe Generale SA in London, said the ECB’s decision to focus on greasing the banking sector rather than cutting rates “is a completely appropriate reaction to the current conditions” as “the problem in the euro area is not an excessively high level of short term interest rates.” Risk to Growth Still, the crisis has “started to infect the real economy,” said Joerg Kraemer , chief economist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. The ECB in September cut its growth forecasts to 1.6 percent from 1.9 percent for 2011 and to 1.3 percent from 1.7 percent for 2012. Euro-area service and manufacturing industries last month contracted for the first time in more than two years. Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer Josef Ackermann blamed the slowdown in Europe for his bank’s troubles. About 42 percent of revenue from the bank’s sales and trading operations came from Europe last year, Ackermann said on Oct 4. The bank will write down its Greek sovereign debt holdings by about 250 million euros for the third quarter after a 155- million-euro value reduction at the end of the second quarter. Banks Gain France ’s Natixis (KN) and BNP Paribas (BNP) SA were among the biggest gainers on the 46-member Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index yesterday. Natixis climbed as much as 13 percent, while Paribas was up as much as 7.8 percent. Trichet yesterday said European banks and supervisors including the European Banking Authority should do everything they can to address the need for recapitalization and banks shouldn’t be reluctant to accept state help when needed. “There finally seems to be a plan in Europe and what the ECB did yesterday certainly complemented that,” said Gilles Moec , co-chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London. “The ECB has always been ready to step up to the plate if governments show a willingness to shoulder responsibility. It wasn’t always the case in the past, but it looks like it’s coming together now.” To contact the reporters on this story: Gabi Thesing in London at  gthesing@bloomberg.net ; Jeff Black in Frankfurt at  Jblack25@bloomberg.net.

MetLife Amends $7 Billion Deposit Deal With GE,['Zachary Tracer'],2012-09-22 04:00:03,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/metlife-amends-bank-deposit-deal-with-ge-to-sidestep-fdic-1-.html,"MetLife Inc. (MET) , the insurer seeking to exit banking to limit U.S. oversight, amended a deal to sell about $7 billion in deposits to General Electric Co. (GE) so that Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approval is no longer required. The deal will now be subject to approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the New York-based insurer said yesterday in a regulatory filing. Under the new arrangement, the deposits would be assumed by GE Capital Retail Bank rather than GE Capital Bank, the insurer said. MetLife gained 2.7 percent to $35.80 as of 6:01 p.m. yesterday in extended trading in New York. MetLife Chief Executive Officer Steven Kandarian is seeking to reduce supervision from the Federal Reserve after the regulator twice blocked his company’s plans to return capital to shareholders. MetLife may increase its dividend and repurchase shares after exiting bank status, according to Barclays Plc. The new arrangement will “enable us to ultimately deregister as a bank holding company following completion of the deal,” Christopher Breslin , a MetLife spokesman, said yesterday by phone. He declined to say when the sale would be completed or discuss the oversight of the Fed, which had given MetLife a Sept. 30 deadline to submit a new capital plan. Bryan Hubbard , an OCC spokesman, didn’t respond to requests for comment. ‘Better Fit’ “We made the decision to restructure the transaction,” Russell Wilkerson , a spokesman for Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE, said yesterday. “As we went through the integration process, which has been going on since December of last year, we saw the consumer deposits, technology platform and strategic needs in the retail bank were a better fit.” MetLife said that once the deal is complete, it will take steps with the FDIC to terminate its deposit insurance and deregister as a bank holding company. “As of now, the GE application is pending,” Andrew Gray , an FDIC spokesman, said yesterday. MetLife said in March that it would escape bank status by the end of June. Kandarian later backed away from that assessment, saying he couldn’t read regulators. MetLife had a June 12 deadline to submit a fresh capital plan to the Fed, and the regulator extended the deadline to Sept. 30. MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, has kept its annual dividend at 74 cents a share since 2007 and hasn’t announced a buyback since 2008. No. 2 Prudential Financial Inc.

The Fed said March 13 that MetLife would fall short of U.S. capital standards in a severe economic downturn. MetLife was the only insurer among 19 large financial institutions the Fed evaluated. The shares fell 12 percent since then through the close of trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. MetLife has said the Fed’s model isn’t appropriate for insurers, which are usually overseen by state regulators in the U.S., and that the company was at an unfair advantage against smaller rivals who didn’t face the scrutiny.

(MET) , the insurer seeking to exit banking to limit U.S. oversight, amended a deal to sell about $7 billion in deposits to General Electric Co. (GE) so that Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approval is no longer required. The deal will now be subject to approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the New York-based insurer said yesterday in a regulatory filing. Under the new arrangement, the deposits would be assumed by GE Capital Retail Bank rather than GE Capital Bank, the insurer said. MetLife gained 2.7 percent to $35.80 as of 6:01 p.m. yesterday in extended trading in New York. MetLife Chief Executive Officer Steven Kandarian is seeking to reduce supervision from the Federal Reserve after the regulator twice blocked his company’s plans to return capital to shareholders. MetLife may increase its dividend and repurchase shares after exiting bank status, according to Barclays Plc. The new arrangement will “enable us to ultimately deregister as a bank holding company following completion of the deal,” Christopher Breslin , a MetLife spokesman, said yesterday by phone. He declined to say when the sale would be completed or discuss the oversight of the Fed, which had given MetLife a Sept. 30 deadline to submit a new capital plan. Bryan Hubbard , an OCC spokesman, didn’t respond to requests for comment. ‘Better Fit’ “We made the decision to restructure the transaction,” Russell Wilkerson , a spokesman for Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE, said yesterday. “As we went through the integration process, which has been going on since December of last year, we saw the consumer deposits, technology platform and strategic needs in the retail bank were a better fit.” MetLife said that once the deal is complete, it will take steps with the FDIC to terminate its deposit insurance and deregister as a bank holding company. “As of now, the GE application is pending,” Andrew Gray , an FDIC spokesman, said yesterday. MetLife said in March that it would escape bank status by the end of June. Kandarian later backed away from that assessment, saying he couldn’t read regulators. MetLife had a June 12 deadline to submit a fresh capital plan to the Fed, and the regulator extended the deadline to Sept. 30. MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, has kept its annual dividend at 74 cents a share since 2007 and hasn’t announced a buyback since 2008. No. 2 Prudential Financial Inc.

"Schwarzman, Bommer, Wendi Murdoch, Soros, Princess Talal",['Am' 'a Gordon'],2012-09-19 16:12:47,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/schwarzman-bommer-wendi-murdoch-soros-princess-talal.html,"Last night, being the fiancee of George Soros meant being asked to take his picture for an admirer. “It looks pretty good,” Tamiko Bolton said looking into the screen of the point-and-shoot camera belonging to a junior staffer at the Institute of International Education. The couple also looked pretty good posing together at the institute’s gala at Cipriani Wall Street , where Soros and others were honored for founding the Institute’s Scholar Rescue Fund 10 years ago. First came dinner, beef and thinly sliced potatoes. Soros ate his in the company of Princess Ghida Talal; she and her husband have helped more than 250 Iraqi scholars find a safe haven in Jordan. Then Soros joined the other founders on stage: investor and economist Henry Kaufman ; Thomas A. Russo, general counsel at American International Group Inc. (AIG) ; and Henry G. Jarecki, chairman of Gresham Investment Management LLC and father of Nicholas Jarecki, the director of the film “Arbitrage” starring Richard Gere , who bought a ticket to the gala, but did not attend. Senator Patrick Leahy , the Vermont Democrat, gave tributes. “I’ve often found myself in committee meetings saying, ‘Couldn’t we do at least as much as George Soros does?’” Senator Leahy said. Martin Buber Soros first heard about the idea for the Scholar Rescue Fund from Jarecki, who was inspired by the institute’s rescue in the 1930s of intellectuals such as Martin Buber and Paul Tillich through its Emergency Committee to Aid Displaced German Scholars. “I wondered if the occasions when it would be needed were frequent enough,” Soros said. “It’s fair to say the fund has proven me wrong. With the bloodshed in Syria, we’re on the verge of another such occasion.” The fund has provided aid to 467 scholars whose lives and work have been threatened, helping them find safety as visiting professors. Abdul Sattar Jawad, a professor of comparative literature, left Baghdad through the fund and found a permanent home at Duke University. Arabian Nights “It’s the Harvard of the South,” he said. “I am happy to be teaching what I like.” For his course “Arabian Nights in the West” this semester, the reading includes “The Canterbury Tales” and “The Decameron.” At the lectern, Jarecki announced that he would match $3 million in new gifts made to the Scholar Rescue Fund, for a total of $6 million. The fund has an endowment of $27 million. “We need dissidents,” Jarecki said. “They have endured harassment, isolation, interrogation, imprisonment, torture, death. And they all share one trait: They just won’t shut up.” At the exit, guests received the goody bag: a Western Union Foundation tote containing a book by Soros -- “Financial Turmoil in Europe and the United States : Essays” -- and an Omanhene chocolate bar made in Ghana. For Children Steve Schwarzman , in a tuxedo, and his wife, Christine, in a blue-and-white gown and matching jewelry, stepped off 42nd Street into an expertly lit grove of trees, flanked by half a dozen cameramen. It was the very chic step and repeat at the New Yorkers for Children gala last night at Cipriani 42nd Street. Also passing through: Giants defensive end Justin Tuck , models Hilary Rhoda and Jessica White, Aerin Lauder, who has her own beauty line, and New Yorkers for Children board members Donya Bommer, in a lilac gown, and Kelly Behun Sugarman, in a red one. There was also Wendi Murdoch, in a sequined Ashish cocktail dress, and Alexandra Kaufmann, who works in investor relations at Pershing Square Capital Management LP, in red Versace. “It’s fun to get to see everybody looking beautiful, but this is about substance too,” Bommer, wife of hedge-fund manager Scott Bommer, said. “We fill in the holes for the kids. It’s all the things your mom and dad get you for school: a laptop, money for books and clothes.” In the side hall, waiters offered pigs in blankets and little plates of risotto to about 20 young men and women who have been in foster care and received aid from New Yorkers for Children. ‘Double Work’ Amara Toure, 21, had the “double work” of being in foster care and coming from Guinea. Martin Jack, 24, chose to be a child-care worker after being in foster care for 13 years. “I feel the best people out there to help kids are people who have real experiences,” Jack said. “I got into foster care at the age of 9,” Brian Fleurimond, 21, said. “My mother was brutally murdered. I’ve moved to maybe 10 different homes in the past 12 years.” Fleurimond is studying criminal justice at the State University of New York ’s Genesee Community College “because the killer of my mother never got caught,” and social work, so he can “work with kids like me,” he said. It was his first time attending the event, to which he wore saddle shoes and an Armani Exchange suit he bought with earnings from a summer job at a CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) store on the Upper West Side. “I’m into fashion,” he said. “That comes from people looking at me like a foster kid. I carry myself so I don’t have a stigma, so people don’t judge me.” As for the event: “It’s something I’ve never seen before,” Fleurimond said. “I’m willing to meet new people. They may open up doors for me.” (Amanda Gordon is a writer and photographer for Muse, the arts and leisure section of Bloomberg News. Any opinions expressed are her own.)

New Zealand Officials Monitor Oil Slick as Ship Remains on Reef,['Tracy Withers'],2011-10-06 01:29:30,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/new-zealand-officials-monitor-oil-slick-as-ship-remains-on-reef.html,"New Zealand authorities are monitoring an oil slick near a container ship that is caught on a reef near the North Island port of Tauranga. An observation flight over the area early today showed a slick of thinly spread oil streaming about 2,000 meters in a narrow strip from the ship, Maritime New Zealand said in a statement on its website. Officials are conducting an on-water assessment. “The oil is very thin and it appears it is starting to break up and disperse naturally,” Rob Service, from Maritime New Zealand’s national response team, said in the statement. The 236-meter (774-foot) long Rena struck the reef about 12 nautical miles off the coast early on Oct. 5, and remains stable on the rocks. Two of the ship’s holds have flooded and the ship has a slight list, although tanks containing fuel oil are undamaged, Maritime New Zealand said. Talks are under way with the captain, the ship’s owners and salvage experts to assess how to move the ship off the reef, the agency said.

Tessier will focus on investor relations in Europe and report to Andrew Bellis, a partner and managing director at 3i Debt Management, according to an e-mailed statement from the company. Tessier worked on European and U.S. structured credit products at Cantor Fitzgerald. 3i is seeking to more than double its debt business to $25 billion through expanding in the U.S., high-yield bonds and direct lending, Jeremy Ghose, chief executive officer of 3i Debt Management, said in an interview at his London office. “We will be looking for acquisitions of credit management firms,” Ghose said. “One of the areas we will develop is high- yield bonds, which offers a natural complement to our loans business.” 3i announced plans in June to cut a third of its workforce, reshape its private equity business and focus on infrastructure and debt as new chief executive Simon Borrows came under pressure to revive profit and return money to investors. The debt management unit boosted its assets to as much as $10.2 billion, it said in August, through a new venture with New York-based WCAS Fraser Sullivan Investment Management LLC. Last month it formed Jamestown CLO I Ltd., a U.S. collateralized loan obligation of $461.2 million.

It reduced headcount by 104 employees and closed offices in Barcelona , Copenhagen, Hong Kong , Milan and Shanghai , according to the statement. 3i will avoid mezzanine financing, distressed debt and real estate, as well as asset-backed deals for the time being. “I am not convinced there is room for growth for real mezzanine financing, ” Ghose said. “It will become more difficult to get buyout firms to see the merit of using mezzanine debt now that required returns almost match that of equity.” 3i fell 0.1 percent to 209.4 pence in London trading today.

"Faurecia to Cut 3,000 Jobs as Growth Focus Shifts Outside Europe",['Mathieu Rosemain'],2012-11-12 13:53:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/faurecia-to-cut-3-000-jobs-as-growth-focus-shifts-outside-europe.html,"Faurecia (EO) , Europe ’s largest maker of car interiors, plans to cut about 3,000 jobs in its home region, or 7.5 percent of the workforce, by the end of next year as it retrenches in lackluster European markets. Faurecia intends to cut about 1,500 jobs next year, the same number eliminated in 2012, Chief Financial Officer Frank Imbert said in an interview in London today. The restructuring will lead to about 100 million euros ($127 million) in charges this year and 90 million in 2013, the company said. “Our objective is to stop the bleeding in Europe next year,” Chief Executive Officer Yann Delabriere said today at a meeting with investors. “We have lost significant cash flow in Europe, and we have to adapt.” The French manufacturer, 57 percent-owned by PSA Peugeot Citroen, last month cut its 2012 profit outlook, forecasting a decline in fourth-quarter European sales on a “significant” slowdown in auto production. The Nanterre-based partsmaker is seeking to expand outside Europe as the region’s car market heads for a fifth straight annual decline, with carmakers Peugeot, Fiat SpA (F) and Renault SA (RNO) leading the drop. Faurecia rose as much as 2.4 percent to 11.75 euros and was up 1.9 percent as of 2 p.m. in Paris. The stock has declined 20 percent this year, valuing the company at 1.29 billion euros. Growth Strategy Faurecia plans to grow by 6 percent to 7 percent per year and reach sales of 22 billion euros by 2016, Delabriere said. The company’s growth strategy will focus on boosting the share of sales outside Europe to 55 percent in 2016 from 37 percent last year. The French manufacturer plans to lift its operating profit margin to at least 5 percent of sales by 2016, two years later than previously planned, as the sovereign-debt crisis saps demand in its home region. Faurecia said the slowdown will require additional restructuring with a “gradual” recovery not expected to start until 2014. Industrywide European auto sales will decline 10 percent this year, the most since 1993, according to ACEA, the region’s automotive-industry association. General Motors Co. (GM) said Oct. 31 it will eliminate 2,600 European jobs by the end of 2012. Ford Motor Co. will shut two plants in England next year and one in Belgium in 2014, cutting 6,200 jobs, while Peugeot is eliminating 8,000 positions and closing a factory near Paris to reduce costs. “The very weak European environment impacted our operating margin, which resulted in a delay” of the target, Delabriere said at meeting with investors today in London. “We expect a further drop of the European car market next year.” To contact the reporter on this story: Mathieu Rosemain in Paris at  mrosemain@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at  cthomas16@bloomberg.net",['Mathieu Rosemain'],"Faurecia to Cut 3,000 Jobs as Growth Focus Shifts Outside Europe Faurecia (EO) , Europe ’s largest maker of car interiors, plans to cut about 3,000 jobs in its home region, or 7.5 percent of the workforce, by the end of next year as it retrenches in lackluster European markets.

Ford Motor Co. will shut two plants in England next year and one in Belgium in 2014, cutting 6,200 jobs, while Peugeot is eliminating 8,000 positions and closing a factory near Paris to reduce costs. “The very weak European environment impacted our operating margin, which resulted in a delay” of the target, Delabriere said at meeting with investors today in London. “We expect a further drop of the European car market next year.” To contact the reporter on this story: Mathieu Rosemain in Paris at  mrosemain@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at  cthomas16@bloomberg.net",2863,475,30,54.542373417721535,13,0,False,46,11,4,True,False,5.023157894736842,-1,-1,19,-1,negative,0.43083256483078003,sadness,0.43083256483078003,negative,0.9671481847763062,,0,
Dollar Advances Against Euro Amid Fiscal-Cliff Meeting,['Joseph Ciolli'],2012-11-16 22:18:17,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/yen-near-6-month-low-as-election-spurs-bets-of-more-boj-easing.html,"The dollar rose for the first time in three days versus the euro as investors sought haven assets amid concern President Barack Obama ’s talks with U.S. lawmakers to avert the so-called fiscal cliff will stall. The Dollar Index extended its fourth weekly advance as Hamas said it fired at the parliament in Jerusalem as Israel deployed tanks near the Gaza border. The yen strengthened against most of its 16 major counterparts amid speculation this week’s drop was too rapid. The franc fell after Swiss National Bank President Thomas Jordan said the currency remains a strain on the economy. “You have this fiscal-cliff issue being seen as very risk negative,” Alan Ruskin , global head of Group of 10 foreign- exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Lunch Money” with Sara Eisen. “The dollar is reacting in a very orthodox fashion to this. Eventually, this is going to turn into a risk-buying opportunity.” The dollar climbed 0.3 percent to $1.2743 per euro at 5 p.m. New York time. It rose 0.2 percent to 81.32 yen, advancing 2.3 percent for the week. The greenback touched 81.46 yen yesterday, the strongest level since April 25. The Japanese currency gained 0.1 percent to 103.60 per euro and posted a weekly decline of 2.5 percent. The greenback may increase to the low $1.30 range against the euro if investors reverse course and start seeking risk, according to Ruskin. The dollar last broke $1.30 on Oct. 31. The Dollar Index (DXY) , which is used to track the greenback versus the currencies of six U.S. trading partners, rose 0.1 percent to 81.194, extending its weekly advance to 0.2 percent. Rand, Franc South Africa’s rand gained versus all of its major counterparts after failing yesterday to break through 9 per dollar, seen as an important resistance level to further weakness. Resistance refers to an area on a chart where sell orders may be gathered. The currency advanced 0.6 percent to 8.8643 per dollar after appreciating as much as 0.8 percent, its biggest increase since Nov. 6. The rand has still weakened against all of its major peers but the yen this week. The franc fell against the dollar after Jordan addressed the SNB ceiling of 1.20 francs per euro, introduced in September 2011 after the currency rose to a record, hurting exporters. “At its current rate, the Swiss franc remains high and is weighing on the Swiss economy,” Jordan said in Zurich today, according to a copy of his speech. “The minimum exchange rate against the euro will continue to apply” as the reasons for setting it “retain their validity.” Middle East The franc dropped 0.4 percent to 94.55 centimes per dollar and was little changed at 1.2048 versus the euro. It touched 1.2035 on Nov. 14, the strongest since Sept. 12. The euro declined against the majority of its most-traded peers as Israel continued its bombing of the Gaza Strip and militant groups fired rockets at the Jewish state. The unrest in the the Middle East is “something that’s weighing on sentiment in general,” Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist for Gain Capital Group LLC in New York. “It’s certainly one of several concerns that’s putting pressure on the euro.” The dollar remained stronger after House Speaker John Boehner said he offered a “framework” including new revenue to reduce the U.S. budget deficit in his first face-to-face talks today with Obama and top Congress leaders since the Nov. 6 election. The leaders will meet again with Obama the week after Thanksgiving, he said. ‘Risk-Negative’ “Investors might be taking a little risk off the table,” Brian Daingerfield, a currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s RBS Securities unit in Stamford , Connecticut , said in a telephone interview. “The idea that the two sides are still far apart would likely be a risk-negative development.” If the U.S. Congress doesn’t act by the end of the year, $607 billion in spending cuts and tax increases are scheduled to take effect starting in January, while the $16.4 trillion debt ceiling must be raised before it’s reached early next year for the nation to continue to borrow. The dollar held gains even as output at factories, mines and utilities dropped 0.4 percent last month after a revised 0.2 percent increase in September that was smaller than previously estimated, Federal Reserve data showed today in Washington. Economists forecast a 0.2 percent gain, according to the Bloomberg survey median. The Fed said the storm cut total production by almost 1 percentage point. Japan Elections The dollar has advanced 1.7 percent in the past month, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10 developed-nation currencies. The yen dropped 1.7 percent and the euro fell 1 percent. The yen still registered its steepest weekly drop against the dollar since February on prospects Japan ’s opposition party will take power after elections next month and increase pressure on the central bank to expand monetary easing. The Japanese currency has seen “several days of strong rallies” after Liberal Democratic Party head Shinzo Abe called for the central bank to provide unlimited stimulus, according to Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange at BK Asset Management. The yen should continue its upward trend if it stays about at key resistance level at 81.50, he said. ‘Serious Attempt’ “Abe’s stance is the first sign of a serious attempt to realign Japan’s ineffective monetary and exchange-rate policy,” Schlossberg said. “If he is elected the markets will likely give him the benefit of doubt, propping up dollar-yen for the time being.” Europe ’s shared currency pared a weekly advance against the yen as euro-area finance ministers prepared to meet in Brussels on Nov. 20 to discuss ways of plugging the funding gap resulting from granting Greece an extension to reach budget-deficit goals in its bailout program. “The focus is on Greece and its funding,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann , head of currency strategy at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “If we see a solution on Greece at the meeting next week then we might see some relief in the euro.” Europe’s shared currency is likely to stay above its 100- day moving average at $1.2648, analysts at Landesbank Hessen- Thueringen in Frankfurt including Ralf Umlauf wrote in a note to investors today. The currency, which reached a two-month low against the dollar this week, is oversold, according to a stochastic technical indicator, the strategists said, and therefore may stabilize around current levels. The stochastic oscillator was at 10 today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, below the 30 threshold that signals the currency may have depreciated too quickly and is poised for a rebound. A stochastic oscillator chart measures the closing price of a security relative to its highs and lows during a particular period to try to predict whether it will rise or fall.

The vessels will earn an average of $125,000 a day in the fourth quarter and first three months of next year, the Oslo- based investment bank said in an e-mailed report today, lowering prior estimates of $150,000. Declining LNG prices in Japan have narrowed the gap with costs in the Atlantic region, eliminating the profit from transporting the fuel to Asia , Fearnley said. “We are still long-term positive to the LNG market,” the bank said. Shares of Golar LNG Ltd. (GLNG) , which has the largest number of LNG tankers on order, will probably rise 19 percent to $47 within 12 months, Fearnley said.

During his treatment, doctors drained fluid surrounding his lungs.

Canada’s Deficit Widens in First Two Months on Inflation,['Theophilos Argitis'],2013-07-26 15:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/canada-s-deficit-widens-in-first-two-months-on-inflation.html,"Canada ’s budget deficit widened in the first two months of the fiscal year as slower than expected inflation damped revenue growth. The federal government ran a deficit of C$2.71 billion ($2.63 billion) in April and May, compared with a two-month gap of C$1.82 billion a year ago, the finance department said in an e-mailed statement. Revenue grew 1.4 percent, less than half the 3.4 percent increase in total expenses. Inflation this year has been slower than policy makers predicted as the country’s economy struggles to build momentum, crimping revenue from price-sensitive levies such as the sales tax. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty ’s annual budget, released in March, projected inflation of 1.3 percent this year, along with a deficit shrinking to C$18.7 billion, from C$25.9 billion last year. The Bank of Canada last week lowered the average of its quarterly forecasts for price increases this year to 1 percent. Revenue from the country’s goods and services tax fell 7.7 percent during the two-month period to C$4.89 billion. Income tax gains rose 2 percent to C$25.8 billion. Total revenue was up 1.4 percent to C$41.8 billion, including an 8.2 percent increase in employment insurance premiums.

"HTC, Apple, Omni-ID, Avalanche: Intellectual Property",['Victoria Slind-Flor'],2013-03-11 10:57:29,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/htc-apple-omni-id-avalanche-intellectual-property.html,"HTC Corp. (2498) won dismissal of two Nokia Oyj (NOK) patent-infringement lawsuits in Germany , the first rulings from that country in the global intellectual-property dispute between the companies. The judges didn’t find that HTC violated Nokia’s patents, Joachim Bock, spokesman for the Mannheim Regional Court, which heard the cases, said in an interview March 8. In one of the actions, Nokia argued HTC illicitly used its technology to run Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Play store on its smartphones. Nokia last year sued HTC, BlackBerry and ViewSonic Corp. in the U.S., U.K. and Germany over a total of 45 patents. The Finnish mobile-phone maker, struggling to reverse a slide in sales, settled with BlackBerry in December. A month earlier, HTC reached a global settlement with Apple Inc. (AAPL) of their patent disputes. Nokia can appeal the March 8 ruling. “Nokia respectfully disagrees with the court’s decision and we are considering our options,” Mark Durrant, spokesman for the Espoo, Finland-based company, said in an e-mailed statement. Nokia asserted violation of more than 30 further patents against HTC in Germany, the U.S. and the U.K. and expects to prevail regarding those, he said. “Nokia has exaggerated the scope of its patent in order to extract unwarranted licensing royalties from Android handset manufacturers,” HTC said in an e-mailed statement referring to Google’s mobile software. “The Android platform is now safe from oppressive enforcement of this patent.” Google supported Taiwan ’s HTC as a party in the case over the Play store, which allows Android device users to download applications and media. The Mannheim court is scheduled to rule March 19 on whether HTC infringed a Nokia patent for technology used to regulate a device’s battery power use. Apple Objects to Second Samsung Patent Lawsuit Being Put on Hold Apple Inc. objected to the possibility that proceedings in a patent lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) scheduled for trial in 2014 will be put on hold while an appeals court reviews an August verdict in an earlier case. The objection, filed March 7 in federal court in San Jose , California , was in response to U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh’s inquiry at a hearing last month. The judge said she was skeptical of the need for both cases to proceed, especially while the first case is being appealed. On March 1, Koh reduced a jury’s $1.05 billion damages award to Apple in the first case by $450.5 million. The jury based its award for 14 Samsung products on an incorrect legal theory, Koh ruled. She said the companies should consider appealing her decision before any damages trial begins. “This case must proceed now, in order to stop the ongoing sales -- and relentless launch -- of Samsung’s latest infringing devices, which have caused, and every day continue to cause, continuing harm to Apple,” the Cupertino, California-based company said in the filing. Samsung said in the same filing, a joint report filed with Apple, that it agrees with the judge that the second case should be put on hold to “promote judicial economy.” The lawsuit was filed last year and covers technology in newer smartphones made by both companies, including Samsung’s Galaxy S III and Apple’s iPhone 5. Apple is challenging a decision by Koh that allows Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung to continue selling some products that were found by the jury to infringe Apple patents. In a Feb. 12 filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington , Apple said that Samsung has taken market share based on its “deliberate copying of Apple’s innovative iPhone and iPad products” and asked the court to halt the sales. In the March 8 filing, Samsung said staying the more recent case will “allow the parties to attempt to reach a business resolution of their disputes.” The earlier case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-cv-01846, and the case scheduled for trial next year is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 12-cv-00630, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). Omni-ID Says Xerafy Infringes Patents for RFID ‘On-Metal’ Tags Omni-ID Cayman Ltd., a maker of radio-frequency identification tags, sued a competitor for patent infringement. In the suit filed in federal court in Camden, New Jersey , Hong Kong-based Xerafy is accused of infringing two patents related to what are known as “on-metal” tags. Rochester, New York ’s Omni-ID claims in its pleadings that to no avail it sent Xerafy cease-and-desist notices related to the two patents in 2012. The company said in a statement that it began a program last year for the licensing of the two disputed patents. Company Chief Executive Officer George E. Daddis Jr. said that “unfortunately, even with the launch of our licensing program, we are still seeing many on-metal products being sold today that are clearly utilizing these foundational technologies owned by Omni-ID.” In dispute are patents 7,880,619, issued in February 2011, and 7,768,400, issued in August. Omni-ID asked the court for an order barring further infringement, and for awards of money damages, attorney fees and litigation costs. Xerafy didn’t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for comment. The case is Omni-ID USA Inc., v. Xerafy, 1:13-cv-00801-NLH- AMD, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Camden).

Trademark Acker Merrall Sued in Hong Kong by LVMH Over Champagne Trademark Acker Merrall & Condit Co., a New York-based wine-auction house, was sued in a Hong Kong court for trademark infringement by a unit of France ’s LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , the South China Post reported. LVMH’s MHCS SCS unit claims the auctioneer is infringing marks related to its Rheims, France-based Krug Champagne house, according to the South China Post. The Champagne-maker seeks a court order barring Acker Merrall Asia from using the marks in connection with products not made by MHCS SCS and also seeks money damages, the newspaper reported. The auction house, which didn’t respond immediately the Hong Kong newspaper’s request for comment, has held wine auctions there that have brought record princes for French wines, including a case of CH. Le Pin 1982 that went for HK$823,0000 ($106,000), according to the South China Post. ‘Salame Felino’ Gets Geographic-Origin Name Protection in EU A kind of cured sausage created in Italy ’s Parma region received geographic-name protection in the European Union. According to a March 5 entry in the Official Journal of the European Union, “ Salame Felino ” is now protected, although Belgium, Germany and France had initially objected to some of the details included in the description of the item. In order to be designated “Salame Felino,” the sausage must be produced from specific breeds of pigs, and the meat must come from specific parts of the animal. The sausage must be placed into natural hog casing, tied with twine, and must be free of lactose and powdered milk. According to the journal entry, references to such sausage dates back to the first century, and it was “well known” by the Bourbons. A frieze depicting the sausage can be found in the decorations of the Baptistery of Parma , which dates as far back as 1196. For more trademark news, click here. Copyright Keith Haring Foundation Claims Miami Exhibit Is Showing Fakes The foundation that holds the intellectual property rights of the late artist Keith Haring filed a copyright and trademark infringement lawsuit over an art show in Miami. Haring, who is best known for his cartoon-line “ Radiant Baby ” images, was a social activist and artist who died of AIDS in 1990 at the age of 31. According to the complaint filed in federal court March 8, most of the works exhibited at the Haring Miami show, held this past weekend in Miami’s Moore Building, were “fakes, forgeries, counterfeits and/or infringements.” According to the complaint, the exhibition catalog contains a disclaimer that some of the work being shown “has not been submitted or examined by the Keith Haring Foundation for authenticity.” The foundation says this disclaimer fails to note that many of the works had been submitted for authentication and were found to be inauthentic. A representative of the New York-based Keith Haring Foundation attended the show’s March 6 opening night and found that of the four floors of exhibited works “approximately 8 works were real works of Haring.” Many who attended the show “believed the art being displayed was by Keith Haring ,” according to court papers. The foundation claims that of about 80 paintings in the show, only one was an authentic work by Haring. “Each of these works of art, if they were really Haring works, would be worth in the range of $500,000 to $1 million,” according to the complaint. Putting these works into the market “will cause enormous and irreparable damage” to its reputation, the foundation said. The foundation said that for the most part, “they are poor quality fake Harings.” The foundation says it is harmed by the actions of the show’s promoters, and asked the court to bar the defendants from advertising, displaying, selling or offering for sale any works not created by Haring that “bear any indicia of Keith Haring.” Additionally, it asked for impoundment and destruction of the allegedly infringing works, awards of profits the defendants acquired relative to the infringement and for money damages, attorney fees and litigation costs. Herman J. Rossomanno III, a Miami-based lawyer for the show’s organizers, said in an e-mail that his clients and the foundation came to an agreement that the show was able to exhibit 10 pieces of Keith Haring artwork. The case is The Keith Haring Foundation Inc. v. Colored Thumb Corp., 1:13-cv-20830, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida (Miami). Avalanche Studios’ Founder Down on Some Anti-Piracy Technologies The founder of the Swedish game development company Avalanche Studios thinks many elements of digital-rights management technology are more harmful than helpful, the Gaming Bolt computer-game news website reported. Christofer Sundberg told Gaming Bolt that digital-rights systems that limit the players’ game experience shouldn’t be used. He said such systems make game developers look greedy and treat the game’s fans like criminals, according to Gaming Bolt. At the same time, Sundberg acknowledged to Gaming Bolt that piracy can inhibit game development, saying developers deserve to be paid for what he says is years of hard work.

To contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Hytha at  mhytha@bloomberg.net .",['Victoria Slind-Flor'],"HTC, Apple, Omni-ID, Avalanche: Intellectual Property HTC Corp. (2498) won dismissal of two Nokia Oyj (NOK) patent-infringement lawsuits in Germany , the first rulings from that country in the global intellectual-property dispute between the companies. The judges didn’t find that HTC violated Nokia’s patents, Joachim Bock, spokesman for the Mannheim Regional Court, which heard the cases, said in an interview March 8. In one of the actions, Nokia argued HTC illicitly used its technology to run Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Play store on its smartphones. Nokia last year sued HTC, BlackBerry and ViewSonic Corp. in the U.S., U.K. and Germany over a total of 45 patents. The Finnish mobile-phone maker, struggling to reverse a slide in sales, settled with BlackBerry in December. A month earlier, HTC reached a global settlement with Apple Inc. (AAPL) of their patent disputes. Nokia can appeal the March 8 ruling. “Nokia respectfully disagrees with the court’s decision and we are considering our options,” Mark Durrant, spokesman for the Espoo, Finland-based company, said in an e-mailed statement. Nokia asserted violation of more than 30 further patents against HTC in Germany, the U.S. and the U.K. and expects to prevail regarding those, he said. “Nokia has exaggerated the scope of its patent in order to extract unwarranted licensing royalties from Android handset manufacturers,” HTC said in an e-mailed statement referring to Google’s mobile software. “The Android platform is now safe from oppressive enforcement of this patent.” Google supported Taiwan ’s HTC as a party in the case over the Play store, which allows Android device users to download applications and media. The Mannheim court is scheduled to rule March 19 on whether HTC infringed a Nokia patent for technology used to regulate a device’s battery power use. Apple Objects to Second Samsung Patent Lawsuit Being Put on Hold Apple Inc. objected to the possibility that proceedings in a patent lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) scheduled for trial in 2014 will be put on hold while an appeals court reviews an August verdict in an earlier case. The objection, filed March 7 in federal court in San Jose , California , was in response to U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh’s inquiry at a hearing last month. The judge said she was skeptical of the need for both cases to proceed, especially while the first case is being appealed. On March 1, Koh reduced a jury’s $1.05 billion damages award to Apple in the first case by $450.5 million. The jury based its award for 14 Samsung products on an incorrect legal theory, Koh ruled. She said the companies should consider appealing her decision before any damages trial begins. “This case must proceed now, in order to stop the ongoing sales -- and relentless launch -- of Samsung’s latest infringing devices, which have caused, and every day continue to cause, continuing harm to Apple,” the Cupertino, California-based company said in the filing. Samsung said in the same filing, a joint report filed with Apple, that it agrees with the judge that the second case should be put on hold to “promote judicial economy.” The lawsuit was filed last year and covers technology in newer smartphones made by both companies, including Samsung’s Galaxy S III and Apple’s iPhone 5. Apple is challenging a decision by Koh that allows Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung to continue selling some products that were found by the jury to infringe Apple patents. In a Feb. 12 filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington , Apple said that Samsung has taken market share based on its “deliberate copying of Apple’s innovative iPhone and iPad products” and asked the court to halt the sales. In the March 8 filing, Samsung said staying the more recent case will “allow the parties to attempt to reach a business resolution of their disputes.” The earlier case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-cv-01846, and the case scheduled for trial next year is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 12-cv-00630, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). Omni-ID Says Xerafy Infringes Patents for RFID ‘On-Metal’ Tags Omni-ID Cayman Ltd., a maker of radio-frequency identification tags, sued a competitor for patent infringement. In the suit filed in federal court in Camden, New Jersey , Hong Kong-based Xerafy is accused of infringing two patents related to what are known as “on-metal” tags. Rochester, New York ’s Omni-ID claims in its pleadings that to no avail it sent Xerafy cease-and-desist notices related to the two patents in 2012. The company said in a statement that it began a program last year for the licensing of the two disputed patents. Company Chief Executive Officer George E. Daddis Jr. said that “unfortunately, even with the launch of our licensing program, we are still seeing many on-metal products being sold today that are clearly utilizing these foundational technologies owned by Omni-ID.” In dispute are patents 7,880,619, issued in February 2011, and 7,768,400, issued in August. Omni-ID asked the court for an order barring further infringement, and for awards of money damages, attorney fees and litigation costs. Xerafy didn’t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for comment. The case is Omni-ID USA Inc., v. Xerafy, 1:13-cv-00801-NLH- AMD, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Camden).

Trademark Acker Merrall Sued in Hong Kong by LVMH Over Champagne Trademark Acker Merrall & Condit Co., a New York-based wine-auction house, was sued in a Hong Kong court for trademark infringement by a unit of France ’s LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , the South China Post reported. LVMH’s MHCS SCS unit claims the auctioneer is infringing marks related to its Rheims, France-based Krug Champagne house, according to the South China Post. The Champagne-maker seeks a court order barring Acker Merrall Asia from using the marks in connection with products not made by MHCS SCS and also seeks money damages, the newspaper reported. The auction house, which didn’t respond immediately the Hong Kong newspaper’s request for comment, has held wine auctions there that have brought record princes for French wines, including a case of CH.

According to a March 5 entry in the Official Journal of the European Union, “ Salame Felino ” is now protected, although Belgium, Germany and France had initially objected to some of the details included in the description of the item. In order to be designated “Salame Felino,” the sausage must be produced from specific breeds of pigs, and the meat must come from specific parts of the animal. The sausage must be placed into natural hog casing, tied with twine, and must be free of lactose and powdered milk. According to the journal entry, references to such sausage dates back to the first century, and it was “well known” by the Bourbons. A frieze depicting the sausage can be found in the decorations of the Baptistery of Parma , which dates as far back as 1196. For more trademark news, click here. Copyright Keith Haring Foundation Claims Miami Exhibit Is Showing Fakes The foundation that holds the intellectual property rights of the late artist Keith Haring filed a copyright and trademark infringement lawsuit over an art show in Miami. Haring, who is best known for his cartoon-line “ Radiant Baby ” images, was a social activist and artist who died of AIDS in 1990 at the age of 31. According to the complaint filed in federal court March 8, most of the works exhibited at the Haring Miami show, held this past weekend in Miami’s Moore Building, were “fakes, forgeries, counterfeits and/or infringements.” According to the complaint, the exhibition catalog contains a disclaimer that some of the work being shown “has not been submitted or examined by the Keith Haring Foundation for authenticity.” The foundation says this disclaimer fails to note that many of the works had been submitted for authentication and were found to be inauthentic. A representative of the New York-based Keith Haring Foundation attended the show’s March 6 opening night and found that of the four floors of exhibited works “approximately 8 works were real works of Haring.” Many who attended the show “believed the art being displayed was by Keith Haring ,” according to court papers. The foundation claims that of about 80 paintings in the show, only one was an authentic work by Haring. “Each of these works of art, if they were really Haring works, would be worth in the range of $500,000 to $1 million,” according to the complaint. Putting these works into the market “will cause enormous and irreparable damage” to its reputation, the foundation said.

Paraguay Reclaiming Energy From Brazil in Franco Industrial Push,['Bill Faries'],2012-09-26 04:00:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/paraguay-reclaiming-energy-from-brazil-in-franco-industrial-push.html,"Paraguayan President Federico Franco said Brazil and Argentina will have to accept less hydroelectric energy as the land-locked country develops its industry and tries to accelerate development. “We are no longer going to hand over our energy,” Franco said in an interview yesterday at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York. “We’re going to develop internal markets, we’re going to industrialize our country and Paraguay will no longer just be a country that exports cattle and agricultural goods.” Franco, the former vice president who took office in June after Congress impeached President Fernando Lugo, said he is seeking foreign investors to develop untapped oil fields , build an aluminum plant and buy the country’s first global bonds. The 50-year-old leader said accomplishing that will require using more energy from two hydroelectric dams on the country’s borders, most of which is currently sold to its larger South American neighbors. A surgeon and father of four, Franco is looking beyond the region for support as the country remains suspended from the Mercosur trade bloc and the Union of South American Nations following Lugo’s ouster. The world’s fourth-biggest soybean exporter needs investors from Asia to the U.S. to help develop its resources, while the Mercosur bloc it co-founded may have outlived its usefulness, Franco said. Aluminum Plant Under a treaty with Brazil , Paraguay has the rights to 50 percent of the energy produced by the Itaipu dam yet sells most of that to Brazil, Franco said. The country can boost its energy use from the dam without renegotiating the accord, he said. Of the 11 Itaipu turbines the country has the right to use, only two are directed toward Paraguay, he said. The development of a $4 billion to $5 billion aluminum smelter will require at least one additional turbine, he said. “Paraguay is preparing itself to use its energy and develop the country,” he said. Brazil, Latin America ’s biggest economy, has depended on energy produced by Itaipu for its industrial development. A 2009 blackout caused by the loss of transmission lines from the dam plunged 40 percent of Brazil into darkness, affecting 18 of the country’s 26 states. Replacing Itaipu’s energy entirely with oil would require 536,000 barrels per day, according to the dam’s website. Argentina and Paraguay agreed in January to boost investment in the Yacyreta dam, which helps power the industrial core around Buenos Aires , by 25 percent. About 15 percent of Argentina’s energy needs came from Yacyreta in 2010, according to the plant’s website. Officials at Brazil’s Energy and Foreign Affairs ministries didn’t respond to e-mails seeking comment after business hours. Horacio Mizrahi, an Argentine Planning Ministry spokesman, and Deputy Economy Minister Axel Kicillof declined to comment. Five-Year Plan Jorge Samek, the Brazilian head of Itaipu, said Brazil has sufficient energy for the next five years and that the country supports Paraguay’s development. “The Brazilian government has made all efforts to industrialize Paraguay,” Samek said in an interview from Curitiba, Brazilyesterday. “The Brazilian government wants Paraguay to consume more energy.” Oil production in Paraguay may begin as soon as December, Franco said, while shale resources await exploration and development. The search for investors includes the sale of $550 million in bonds by mid-January as the country seeks to tap the lowest emerging-market borrowing costs on record, he said. Zambia, Bolivia Paraguay joins emerging-market countries including Zambia and Bolivia in seeking to take advantage of record-low yields by raising funds overseas. The yield on emerging-market debt fell to a record 4.71 percent on Sept. 11 and was at 4.77 percent yesterday, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. EMBI Global indexes. Angola , which shares Paraguay’s BB- rating from Standard & Poor’s , sold $1 billion of debt in the form of loan participation notes due in seven years to yield 7 percent in August for its first international issue. S&P removed Paraguay from a negative credit-watch on Aug. 29, saying the political turmoil in the country from Lugo’s ouster would have a “limited impact” on the economy. The political crisis will have a direct impact on Franco, who under Paraguayan law won’t be eligible to run for re- election next April. He said he’ll throw his support behind Senator Efrain Alegre’s candidacy in the race. Franco said Paraguay felt mistreated in the Mercosur trade block by its bigger neighbor and that he couldn’t worry about the implications of his plans on Brazil and Argentina. “The people voted for me to govern my country,” Franco said.

The 50-year-old leader said accomplishing that will require using more energy from two hydroelectric dams on the country’s borders, most of which is currently sold to its larger South American neighbors. A surgeon and father of four, Franco is looking beyond the region for support as the country remains suspended from the Mercosur trade bloc and the Union of South American Nations following Lugo’s ouster. The world’s fourth-biggest soybean exporter needs investors from Asia to the U.S. to help develop its resources, while the Mercosur bloc it co-founded may have outlived its usefulness, Franco said. Aluminum Plant Under a treaty with Brazil , Paraguay has the rights to 50 percent of the energy produced by the Itaipu dam yet sells most of that to Brazil, Franco said. The country can boost its energy use from the dam without renegotiating the accord, he said. Of the 11 Itaipu turbines the country has the right to use, only two are directed toward Paraguay, he said. The development of a $4 billion to $5 billion aluminum smelter will require at least one additional turbine, he said. “Paraguay is preparing itself to use its energy and develop the country,” he said. Brazil, Latin America ’s biggest economy, has depended on energy produced by Itaipu for its industrial development. A 2009 blackout caused by the loss of transmission lines from the dam plunged 40 percent of Brazil into darkness, affecting 18 of the country’s 26 states. Replacing Itaipu’s energy entirely with oil would require 536,000 barrels per day, according to the dam’s website. Argentina and Paraguay agreed in January to boost investment in the Yacyreta dam, which helps power the industrial core around Buenos Aires , by 25 percent. About 15 percent of Argentina’s energy needs came from Yacyreta in 2010, according to the plant’s website. Officials at Brazil’s Energy and Foreign Affairs ministries didn’t respond to e-mails seeking comment after business hours. Horacio Mizrahi, an Argentine Planning Ministry spokesman, and Deputy Economy Minister Axel Kicillof declined to comment. Five-Year Plan Jorge Samek, the Brazilian head of Itaipu, said Brazil has sufficient energy for the next five years and that the country supports Paraguay’s development. “The Brazilian government has made all efforts to industrialize Paraguay,” Samek said in an interview from Curitiba, Brazilyesterday. “The Brazilian government wants Paraguay to consume more energy.” Oil production in Paraguay may begin as soon as December, Franco said, while shale resources await exploration and development. The search for investors includes the sale of $550 million in bonds by mid-January as the country seeks to tap the lowest emerging-market borrowing costs on record, he said. Zambia, Bolivia Paraguay joins emerging-market countries including Zambia and Bolivia in seeking to take advantage of record-low yields by raising funds overseas. The yield on emerging-market debt fell to a record 4.71 percent on Sept. 11 and was at 4.77 percent yesterday, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. EMBI Global indexes. Angola , which shares Paraguay’s BB- rating from Standard & Poor’s , sold $1 billion of debt in the form of loan participation notes due in seven years to yield 7 percent in August for its first international issue. S&P removed Paraguay from a negative credit-watch on Aug. 29, saying the political turmoil in the country from Lugo’s ouster would have a “limited impact” on the economy. The political crisis will have a direct impact on Franco, who under Paraguayan law won’t be eligible to run for re- election next April. He said he’ll throw his support behind Senator Efrain Alegre’s candidacy in the race. Franco said Paraguay felt mistreated in the Mercosur trade block by its bigger neighbor and that he couldn’t worry about the implications of his plans on Brazil and Argentina. “The people voted for me to govern my country,” Franco said.

India Rupee Completes Third Weekly Gain After RBI Tightens Cash,['Jeanette Rodrigues'],2013-07-26 11:51:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/india-rupee-heads-for-third-weekly-gain-after-rbi-tightens-cash.html,"India ’s rupee completed its third weekly gain, the longest winning streak since February, after the central bank tightened the supply of cash to arrest a slide in the currency. The Reserve Bank of India has raised two interest rates and restricted lenders’ access to funds in the past two weeks, pushing the benchmark 10-year bond yield to a 14-month high and leading to debt-sale failures. The measures “should be seen not as a precursor to a substantial change in monetary stance, which, thus far, has been on the easing side,” Raghuram Rajan, the top adviser in the finance ministry, said yesterday in an interview with Bloomberg India TV. The steps should be sufficient, he said. “Such comments are, indeed, what markets would like to hear, as they improve communication of policy intentions,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong, said in an e-mail interview today. “The measures amount to significant tightening and were a mistake as their negative impact on market rates, confidence and growth will be bigger than the positive impact on the rupee.” The rupee advanced 0.5 percent this week to 59.0425 per dollar in Mumbai, according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The currency, which plunged to an unprecedented 61.2125 on July 8, rose 0.1 percent today and touched 58.7025, the strongest level since June 19. RBI Steps Global funds have cut holdings of Indian debt by $9 billion since May 22, when the Federal Reserve first signaled it could curb asset purchases that have boosted demand for emerging-market assets. The RBI capped the amount lenders can borrow in daily repurchase auctions at 0.5 percent of their deposits, it said in a July 23 statement. The authority also raised the daily balance requirement for lenders’ cash-reserve ratios to 99 percent from 70 percent effective July 27. The moves follow steps announced July 15, when the RBI raised its bank rate and marginal standing facility rate to 10.25 percent from 8.25 percent. It left the main repurchase rate unchanged as the economy grows at the slowest pace in a decade. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, fell 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, this week to 11.65 percent. The rate fell 10 basis points today. Forwards Rise “By stabilizing the rupee, we will also enhance the possibility of stronger growth,” the finance ministry’s Rajan said. “Because the inflationary consequence will be contained and, hopefully over time, that will give RBI room to be more accommodative.” Rajan’s comments probably aim to “calm the market’s nerves,” Credit Agricole’s Kowalczyk said. The RBI will keep the benchmark rate at 7.25 percent at a July 30 review, according to all 28 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Three-month onshore rupee forwards were little changed today at 60.60 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were steady at 60.40. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.

Edwards’ Sapien Device as Effective as Open Heart Surgery,['Michelle Fay Cortez'],2013-03-11 15:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/edwards-sapien-device-as-effective-as-open-heart-surgery.html,"Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW) ’s Sapien device, inserted into the heart via a catheter to fix a diseased aortic valve, is as safe and effective as open heart surgery for as long as three years, researchers said. The study presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in San Francisco provides reassuring data about the device approved in the U.S. in October as the first alternative to traditional surgery. The trial, dubbed Partner, found 44.8 percent of surgery patients died within three years, compared with 44.2 percent of Sapien patients. The study also produced favorable results for one of the most-feared complications from inserting the device: strokes. While the risk of stroke was almost double with the Sapien valve after the first year, the danger evened out over time. After three years, 8.2 percent of Sapien patients suffered a stroke, compared with 9.3 percent of the open-heart surgery patients. “In these first-generation transcatheter procedures, we have equivalent midterm outcomes” between Sapien and the gold- standard surgical approach, said lead researcher Vinod Thourani, co-director of the Structural Heart and Valve Center at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. “At three years the surgery group’s stroke rate has caught up with and slightly surpassed” the Sapien rate, though the difference wasn’t significant, Thourani said in a statement. Potential Danger The risk of potentially harmful leakage around the device was significantly higher among the patients getting Sapien. An earlier analysis found patients with even mild rates of leakage had a significantly increased risk of dying, underscoring the need for improving the technology, Thourani said. The devices are a “huge step forward” for treating damaged aortic valves, particularly for patients who might not fare well after standard open heart surgery, said Patrick O’Gara , director of clinical cardiology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston. More information is needed about how well the valves hold up over time, since those sewn into the heart to replace the aortic valve during standard surgery can last for decades, he said. “As a community we remain appropriately concerned about some of the obstacles that need to be overcome before it can be applied to lower and lower risk patients,” O’Gara said. “Three years is a short period of time over which to make assessments about structural valve deterioration.” The study itself will enhance doctor’s conversations with their patients and families, enabling them to discuss how the last few years of the patient’s lives will be lived, O’Gara said. The risks and benefits of each approach are becoming clearer, providing valuable information for comparison, he said. “I don’t think anyone ever envisioned that these devices would be perfect and risk free,” he said. “After all, these are pretty sick patients with lots of reason for which things could go bad.” To contact the reporter on this story: Michelle Fay Cortez in Minneapolis at  mcortez@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Reg Gale at  rgale5@bloomberg.net",['Michelle Fay Cortez'],"Edwards’ Sapien Device as Effective as Open Heart Surgery Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

Boeing Engineers Urged to Reject Contract Offer,['Neil Denslow' 'Victoria Stilwell'],2012-09-19 00:32:36,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/boeing-engineers-urged-to-reject-contract-offer.html,"A union representing Boeing Co. (BA) engineers urged them to reject the planemaker’s contract offer in voting slated to end just five days before the current agreement expires. Leaders of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace unanimously voted against the offer in a meeting yesterday, said Ray Goforth, the union’s executive director. Ballots will be sent to the 23,000 professional and technical members this week and counted after 5 p.m. Oct. 1. “There’s nothing in this proposal that is worth accepting,” Goforth said, calling the wage increases the lowest in decades. “These wages are either stagnant in their purchasing power or lose purchasing power every year.” The union is negotiating its new contract during a record production increase for Boeing. The planemaker plans to boost output 60 percent over four years, work through a backlog on the 787 Dreamliner that mushroomed amid more than three years of delays and develop new variants such as the 737 Max. The union’s decision to put the proposal directly to a member vote is an “unprecedented departure from the normal negotiating process,” Boeing said in a statement today sent to employees. “It appears to us that some have repeatedly tried to provoke an emotional response by creating a perception of mistrust and disrespect.” Larger Contributions The proposal includes competitive wage increases and market-leading benefits, the company said. The planemaker said Sept. 13 that it was offering employees raises while also seeking larger contributions toward health- care insurance. The current contract for the workers, who are mainly based in the Seattle area, ends on Oct. 6. “This is not the time Boeing needs this to happen,” said Carter Leake, a Richmond, Virginia-based analyst at BB&T Capital Markets. “Boeing has its hands full, and these are the type of issues it probably wishes were not occurring.” The profitability of the biggest aerospace company makes its proposal particularly unattractive, Goforth said. Chicago- based Boeing has raised its dividend 10 percent since 2008, when the unions’ last contracts ran out, and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney’s total compensation including pension has increased 21 percent to $22.96 million. “Boeing is not struggling financially,” Goforth said. “All the other stakeholders in the company are being rewarded handsomely.” Contract offer In Boeing’s contract offer, the salary adjustment fund from which engineers are awarded raises would increase by 3.5 percent annually for the next four years. For technical workers, the figure would rise 3 percent in the first year and 2.5 percent after that. Employees’ contributions to their health-care coverage would more than double during the contract to $4,100 a year in 2016 from $2,000 this year, Boeing said in summaries of the proposals posted online. The last contract, in 2008, provided annual raises of about 5 percent and higher pension payments and overtime rates, while union members paid about $200 a year more for improved health- care benefits. A strike vote has not yet occurred, and there is still enough time for the union and Boeing to come to an agreement, Leake said. “As rhetoric increases, it’s more likely that a deal will happen,” he said. “This is a necessary step.” To contact the reporters on this story: Neil Denslow in Hong Kong at  ndenslow@bloomberg.net ; Victoria Stilwell in New York at  vstilwell1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Neil Denslow at  ndenslow@bloomberg.net",['Neil DenslowVictoria Stilwell'],"Boeing Engineers Urged to Reject Contract Offer A union representing Boeing Co.

The union’s decision to put the proposal directly to a member vote is an “unprecedented departure from the normal negotiating process,” Boeing said in a statement today sent to employees. “It appears to us that some have repeatedly tried to provoke an emotional response by creating a perception of mistrust and disrespect.” Larger Contributions The proposal includes competitive wage increases and market-leading benefits, the company said. The planemaker said Sept. 13 that it was offering employees raises while also seeking larger contributions toward health- care insurance. The current contract for the workers, who are mainly based in the Seattle area, ends on Oct. 6. “This is not the time Boeing needs this to happen,” said Carter Leake, a Richmond, Virginia-based analyst at BB&T Capital Markets. “Boeing has its hands full, and these are the type of issues it probably wishes were not occurring.” The profitability of the biggest aerospace company makes its proposal particularly unattractive, Goforth said. Chicago- based Boeing has raised its dividend 10 percent since 2008, when the unions’ last contracts ran out, and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney’s total compensation including pension has increased 21 percent to $22.96 million. “Boeing is not struggling financially,” Goforth said. “All the other stakeholders in the company are being rewarded handsomely.” Contract offer In Boeing’s contract offer, the salary adjustment fund from which engineers are awarded raises would increase by 3.5 percent annually for the next four years. For technical workers, the figure would rise 3 percent in the first year and 2.5 percent after that. Employees’ contributions to their health-care coverage would more than double during the contract to $4,100 a year in 2016 from $2,000 this year, Boeing said in summaries of the proposals posted online. The last contract, in 2008, provided annual raises of about 5 percent and higher pension payments and overtime rates, while union members paid about $200 a year more for improved health- care benefits. A strike vote has not yet occurred, and there is still enough time for the union and Boeing to come to an agreement, Leake said. “As rhetoric increases, it’s more likely that a deal will happen,” he said. “This is a necessary step.” To contact the reporters on this story: Neil Denslow in Hong Kong at  ndenslow@bloomberg.net ; Victoria Stilwell in New York at  vstilwell1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Neil Denslow at  ndenslow@bloomberg.net",3581,563,37,46.90514790925269,0,2,False,38,9,3,False,True,5.355239786856128,-1,-1,-1,-1,negative,0.5534312725067139,anger,0.5534312725067139,neutral,0.6199219226837158,,0,
State Troopers Lose Jobs Over 2012 Sports Car Death Race,['Erik Larson'],2013-03-11 20:21:48,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/new-jersey-state-troopers-forfeit-jobs-over-2012-death-race-.html,"A New Jersey State Police sergeant who escorted a high-speed caravan of Lamborghinis, Ferraris and other sports cars to Atlantic City pleaded guilty to altering the license plates of his troop vehicle to avoid detection. Nadir Nassry, 47, agreed to forfeit his job, as did a second trooper, 29-year-old Joseph Ventrella, who had joined the unauthorized escort at Nassry’s request, New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey S. Chiesa said today in an e-mailed statement. Prosecutors will recommend Nassry receive a probationary term at his sentencing hearing scheduled for April 29, Chiesa said. “These troopers violated” policing standards “and betrayed the public’s trust, undermining public safety and the reputation of the force,” Chiesa said in the statement. “They are justly paying a high price for their poor judgment.” Motorists reported two state-police cruisers on March 30, 2012, leading a group of more than 20 cars in a “Death Race” convoy at speeds of 100 miles (160 kilometers) an hour toward Atlantic City, according to complaints filed with the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. The convoy, which also included several Porsches, started in Fort Lee , New Jersey, across the Hudson River from the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan ; it finished about 133 miles away at the end of the Atlantic City Expressway, near the Trump Taj Mahal casino, according to the attorney general’s office. Records Tampering Nassry, a police officer for 26 years, entered the plea today before Superior Court Judge Bradley Ferencz in Middlesex County. Ventrella, who didn’t plead guilty, agreed to waive indictment and be charged “by accusation” with fourth-degree falsifying or tampering with records, Chiesa said today. “Sergeant Nassry apologizes to motorists endangered on that day” and to Ventrella, “whose career was lost as a result of this one-time act of stupidity,” Nassry’s lawyer, Charles Sciarra, said in an e-mailed statement. While some motorists characterized the high-speed convoy as a “Death Race,” the vehicles weren’t racing each other and no one was killed in the incident. Sciarra said in July 2012 that Nassry led the caravan at the request of Brandon Jacobs , who was a player on the National Football League ’s San Francisco 49ers. Chiesa said at the time that neither Jacobs nor any other drivers escorted by troopers would face criminal charges. A New Jersey pension board must decide whether Nassry will keep his pension, because the crime to which he pleaded guilty isn’t among the offenses that result in automatic forfeiture, said Peter Aseltine, a spokesman for the attorney general, today in a phone interview. Ventrella hadn’t worked long enough to qualify for a pension.

BMW Struggles to Enlarge Mini Market as Coupe Vies for Worst Sales: Cars,['Chris Reiter'],2011-10-06 22:01:52,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/bmw-struggles-to-enlarge-mini-market-as-coupe-vies-for-worst-sales-cars.html,"Boris Knoblich is one of the reasons why Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) is struggling to create a bigger market for the Mini. The 37-year-old media consultant from Berlin doesn’t have the Munich-based manufacturer’s urban car brand on his shopping list, rejecting the new two-seater Mini coupe that his dealer offered as a replacement to his BMW 1-Series compact. “It’s a bit racy-looking compared with other Minis, but too small and not variable enough,” said Knoblich, who’s considering another 1-Series as well as an Audi A3 and Auris hybrid from Toyota Motor Corp. “I need a multifunctional car.” Mini, which was salvaged from the wreckage of the failed takeover of the U.K.’s Rover Group, is central to BMW’s strategy to meet tighter environmental standards and fend off Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi and Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz. The world’s biggest maker of luxury vehicles plans to tighten cooperation between Mini and the namesake brand by sharing front-wheel drive technology after the Mini hatchback is overhauled in 2014. The $22,000 coupe, which went on sale in Europe on Oct. 1 and will hit U.S. dealers later this fall, is the first of three new Mini variants that will go on sale by the end of next year, expanding the lineup to seven similarly sized vehicles. The new models, which all share the same basic underpinnings, will probably do little beyond keeping the brand’s sales from declining as the iconic Mini hatchback ages, analysts said. “Mini can’t do the volumes that they want with the body styles that they have,” said Rebecca Lindland , an analyst IHS Automotive in Norwalk, Connecticut. “They have to push the envelope up and down” with larger and smaller models. Worst Seller Growth in Mini’s deliveries will probably slow to 2.7 percent in 2012 and 1.6 percent in 2013 after jumping 23 percent this year on demand for the four-door Countryman crossover, according to IHS Automotive forecasts. The helmet-topped coupe will be joined by a roadster and the Paceman, a sportier crossover, by the end of 2012. The roadster and coupe are set to vie for the status as the brand’s worst seller, with coupe sales pegged at 6.2 percent of 2013 deliveries of 296,240 cars and the roadster at 5 percent, according to IHS. Audi targeted Mini with the A1 subcompact. Daimler is adding to that pressure as it rolls out five new Mercedes compact cars starting with the revamped B-Class this fall. The automaker’s Smart city car will expand beyond a two-seater from 2013, after confronting its own size limits. Mini isn’t concerned by the potential slow sales for the derivatives and plans further expansion to the lineup and markets, said Kay Segler, the brand’s chief. Ten Minis “I see great potential for Mini,” said Segler in an e- mail response to questions. “There’s no limit to our creativity. We can imagine additional models with typical Mini characteristics -- up to 10 models are conceivable.” Mini, based in Oxford, England, plans to enter India next year after expanding to Indonesia in 2011, he said. BMW is targeting record Mini sales this year, with deliveries set to rise at least 10 percent. The coupe, which competes with $19,545 Honda CR-Z, will be Mini’s first two-seater. The loss of the rear bench leads to a drop in weight of 60 kilograms (132 pounds), helping it accelerate to 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour in 9 seconds, one tenth of a second faster than the corresponding hatchback. The engines are shared with other Mini models. While it’s 2.9 centimeters (1.1 inches) shorter than the hatchback, the length and width are nearly identical, reflecting the size constraints faced by the brand’s models. High Margins “The coupe is quirky, but that’s what Mini is,” said Garel Rhys, president of the auto industry research center at the U.K.’s Cardiff University. “BMW is showing that they’re pretty clever and innovative with the derivatives.” The close association of the coupe with the brand’s other models should boost profit margins, especially considering its price is 1,650 euros, or 8.4 percent, more than the similarly equipped hatchback, said Jonathon Poskitt, an analyst at J.D. Power and Associates in Oxford, England. The coupe relies on “synergies” with other models and every variant has to “stand on its own,” Mini’s Segler said. The new two-seater will likely appeal to men under 35 looking for a conspicuous car, said Werner Entenmann, head of Autohaus Entenmann in Esslingen near Stuttgart. He celebrated the introduction of the model with a party for 800 guests, including a champagne reception and cocktails. ‘No Middle Ground’ “We expect it to be a niche, lifestyle-oriented car,” said Entenmann, who plans to reserve one or two places for the coupe in his Mini showroom, which can display up to eight vehicles. “It either fascinates or leaves people cold. There’s no middle ground.” The coupe is part of Mini’s development toward more independence, said the dealer, who sells Mini and BMW cars. He is hoping for a larger model from the brand. So is Knoblich. “Mini works as a city car,” said the 1-Series driver. “But I need something that’s a city car, can drive long distances and transport stuff and people. Mini doesn’t offer that right now.” To contact the reporter on this story: Chris Reiter in Berlin at  creiter2@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at  cthomas16@bloomberg.net",['Chris Reiter'],"BMW Struggles to Enlarge Mini Market as Coupe Vies for Worst Sales: Cars Boris Knoblich is one of the reasons why Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) is struggling to create a bigger market for the Mini.

Veeva Said to Plan IPO as Cloud Startup Challenges Oracle,['Peter Burrows'],2013-03-11 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/veeva-said-to-plan-ipo-as-cloud-startup-challenges-oracle.html,"Veeva Systems Inc. plans an initial public offering this year, people familiar with the matter said, stepping up a challenge to Oracle Corp. (ORCL) with Web-based software for pharmaceutical sales. Veeva is meeting with banks including Morgan Stanley (MS) and is seeking a valuation of about $2 billion, or 10 times projected 2013 sales, said the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. Revenue is on track to grow at least 50 percent this year as Veeva edges past Oracle in tools to help drugmakers promote treatments to doctors. Breaking away from a model followed by Oracle and others delivering software via Internet to customers across varied industries, Veeva and companies such as Athenahealth Inc. (ATHN) and Dealertrack Technologies Inc. specialize in a specific business like medical offices or car sales. While its share of the $22.3 billion cloud-computing market is small, Veeva has won over many of the world’s top drugmakers. “Veeva’s a shining star that came out of nowhere,” Eric Newmark , an analyst at researcher IDC, said in an interview. “Veeva is No. 1 in pharma in the U.S., and they’re not far behind Oracle for the global lead. They should pass them in the next year or so.” Word-of-mouth is key to Veeva’s success. Within the drug industry , its software has built up a following for the ability to track prescribing habits and tailor pitches to specific doctors. Mobile tools also help sales representatives document samples given to doctors and obtain electronic signatures needed to meet drug-marketing regulations. ‘Great Living’ “Once you get in, there’s a power of incumbency,” said Peter Goldmacher , an analyst at Cowen & Co. “If a small guy can become No. 1 or No. 2 in that market, they can make a great living.” Veeva spends just 25 percent of revenue on product promotion, about half the percentage for Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) , the largest maker of online customer-management software. Lisa Barbadora, a spokeswoman for Pleasanton, California- based Veeva, declined to comment on the IPO plans. “In our particular market, our customers know us almost as well as they know Microsoft Office,” Peter Gassner, Veeva’s co- founder and chief executive officer, said in an interview. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff helped pioneer the idea of delivering software as a service over the Internet, offering sales-tracking tools used by more than 100,000 customers, from donut shops to car makers. Veeva board member Gordon Ritter, who once founded a company with Benioff, said the narrow focus of his current venture offers a better profit model. “ Marc Benioff and other general-purpose cloud leaders won the first round, but industry-specific companies will win the next,” said Ritter, founder of Emergence Capital Partners, which has backed both Salesforce and Veeva. ‘Reasonable Approach’ Benioff called Veeva’s strategy “a very reasonable approach,” in an e-mailed statement. With a narrow focus, though, Veeva could struggle to sustain growth once its targeted industry is saturated, Benioff said. Salesforce will post more than $4 billion in revenue this year, he said. Marketing costs that exceeded 40 percent of sales kept Saleforce from posting a profit in in its most recent fiscal year, a scenario that also played out at two general-purpose cloud software companies that had IPOs in 2012 --  Workday Inc. (WDAY) and ServiceNow Inc. Veeva’s profit last year was about $30 million on sales of $120 million, people familiar with the matter said. Like Veeva, Dealertrak and Athenahealth were profitable in 2012. And all three devoted less than 40 percent of sales to marketing. Lilly, Novartis Gassner co-founded Veeva after a two-year stint at Salesforce. He quickly decided to target the pharmaceutical industry, betting that executives in this heavily regulated sector would pay a steep premium for software that simplified documentation needed to avoid legal hassles. One early customer was Publicis Touchpoint Solutions Inc., which contracts out salespeople to drugmakers. Marketing representatives use Veeva on notebooks, iPads and iPhones when they meet with doctors, said CEO Rick Keefer. “We spend much more money with Veeva than we do with Salesforce,” Keefer said. Veeva, which also counts Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) , Novartis AG (NOVN) and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) among its clients, last year added a content- management system to track clinical data and sales records. Next, it will introduce an online service to provide more information on individual doctors, people familiar with the plans said. The approach of adding more services, which Ritter calls “layering the cake,” has been tried by many of Veeva’s peers. RealPage Inc. (RP) , has added tools to help real-estate brokers check tenant’s backgrounds or offer 3D virtual tours. Dealertrack started with a network to process car loans and later added tools to track inventory, price vehicles and advertise online. Execution Challenges Executing such a strategy isn’t easy. Companies must invest heavily upfront to create software smart enough to anticipate users’s most arcane requirements, and to train customer service representatives to step in when glitches arise. When medical school drop-out Jonathan Bush created Athenahealth in 1997 to improve how doctor’s offices get paid by patients and insurers, he discovered that many transactions were completed via fax. With no other option, he told customers to have the faxes sent to Athena, which hired dozens of workers and set up a call center. Later, he adapted his business with software to handle the work more profitably over the Internet. Athena handles tasks “that people who work in doctors’ offices hate,” said Bush. Now, Athena helps manage appointments, track patient records and complete other common tasks in medical offices. “If every doctor bought all five of our services, our revenue would be $40 billion a year. That’s 10 Salesforce.coms but don’t tell Marc.” To contact the reporter on this story: Peter Burrows in San Francisco at  pburrows@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net",['Peter Burrows'],"Veeva Said to Plan IPO as Cloud Startup Challenges Oracle Veeva Systems Inc. plans an initial public offering this year, people familiar with the matter said, stepping up a challenge to Oracle Corp.

The bank is accused of defrauding the plaintiffs into purchasing CDOs that were “destined -- and indeed, designed -- to fail,” Loreley Financing said in a complaint filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.

Carry Trades Lose Most Since ’11 as HSBC Gauge Warns: Currencies,['Joseph Ciolli'],2012-11-13 18:52:14,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/carry-trades-lose-most-since-11-as-hsbc-gauge-warns-currencies.html,"The foreign-exchange market is signaling more pain ahead for currencies that benefit from a sustained global recovery, five years after the onset of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. HSBC Holdings Plc’s Global Hazard Indicator, which combines implied volatility readings in options for the dollar, euro and yen, shows wider price swings in currencies over the next year than in the coming three months. If history is any guide, that means the dollar and yen will strengthen and higher-yielding, higher-risk currencies such as the Brazilian real and South African rand will depreciate. While reports in the U.S. show gains in jobs and consumer confidence , and data from China signal that services industries are rebounding from 19-month lows , foreign-exchange speculation is a losing bet. The UBS V24 Carry Index that tracks profits from the so-called carry trade, where money borrowed in low- yielding currencies is used to buy those from nations with higher rates, is at about the lowest level since early 2011. “The market is not yet fully convinced that we are back to normal trading conditions, and sees the potential for renewed turbulence in 2013,” said Daragh Maher , a strategist at HSBC in London. “There are plenty of potential triggers for renewed volatility on the horizon,” he said, citing potential spending cuts and tax increases in the U.S., the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and political change in China. Easy Profits Investing the proceeds of dollar-denominated loans should offer easy profits because the Fed has said it probably will keep the target rate for overnight lending between banks near zero through mid-2015. The carry trade can lose money when the currency used to fund the strategy strengthens, or the targeted currency weakens, or some combination. Instead, selling borrowed dollars to buy reais in Brazil, where the target interest rate is 7.25 percent, has lost about 5 percent this year as the real tumbled 23 percent from its 2012 high in February as of 1:44 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The same trade with the rand has lost about 4.8 percent. “The ample provision of liquidity by central banks is at least helping to calm markets and make them more stable than they would otherwise be,” Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo & Co. in New York, said in a Nov. 7 telephone interview. “The tendency for major currencies to be driven by interest rates is somewhat diminished compared to where it has been in the past.” Declining Speculation Foreign-exchange speculation is declining as $607 billion in U.S. spending cuts and tax increases set to take effect Jan. 1, concern that European leaders aren’t moving fast enough to fix the region’s debt crisis, and slowing growth in emerging economies from China to Brazil weigh on sentiment. The world economy will expand 3.3 percent this year, the least since the 2009 recession, the International Monetary Fund said on Oct. 9. The Washington-based IMF also said it sees an “alarmingly high” risk of a steeper slowdown. Average daily volume in foreign exchange conducted through ICAP Plc’s EBS trading system fell 46 percent in October from a year earlier, the company said last week. For all the efforts to restore confidence in the financial system, the world’s foreign-exchange market, where $4 trillion trades each day, is saying that the global economy can’t stand on its own without the unprecedented stimulus by the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan. (8301)  Dollar Favored The euro slid as much as 0.4 percent to $1.2662 today, the weakest since Sept. 7. The yen gained against most of its major counterparts, climbing 0.2 percent to 100.87 per euro and 0.1 percent to 79.40 versus the dollar. Rising volatility may favor the dollar as investors seek the haven of the world’s reserve currency. The euro will depreciate to $1.25 next year, and the dollar will strengthen to 83 yen from 79.40, according to median estimates of more than 35 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. HSBC’s three-month hazard index was most recently at 10.3 percent, below the one-year level of 12.1 percent. The three- month gauge topped the one-year measure by the widest margin in October 2008, a month after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy and pushed the financial system into crisis. The amount by which the one-year index exceeded the three- month measure peaked at 2.9 percent in March 2011, just before the global economy faltered and the MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD) slid 18.3 percent over the next six months. The discrepancy may be more a reflection of investors paring bets, rather than speculation for a weakening economy, according to Steven Englander of Citigroup Inc. ‘Very Soft’ Investors who wagered on increased realized volatility may be getting discouraged by a lack of price fluctuation, causing them to unwind positions and artificially drive down near-term contracts, he said. “With realized volatility so low, everybody who bought volatility sees their positions losing value, which means they sell it back into the market,” Englander, head of Group of 10 currency strategy at Citigroup in New York, said in a Nov. 7 telephone interview. “Until that process is finished, you have short-term volatilities looking very soft.” Realized volatility on one-month euro-dollar options reached its lowest level since 2007 on Oct. 31, dropping to 6.76 percent. Historical volatility for three-month euro-dollar contracts fell to 7.42 on Nov. 6, also the weakest since 2007. The euro will decline to $1.22 by the end of 2013, according to Citigroup. Wells Fargo, the most-accurate currency forecaster as of Sept. 20, also sees the euro slipping to $1.22 against the dollar over that period. HSBC Euro HSBC expects the opposite, with the greenback’s status as a haven diminishing on the approaching fiscal cliff as investors reduce dollar holdings linked to the U.S.’s mounting economic burden, Maher said. The euro will rise to $1.40 by the end of 2013, HSBC projects. Even with the extra stimulus by central banks, the IMF said it sees a one-in-six chance of growth slipping below 2 percent. The Bank of Japan added 11 trillion yen ($137 billion) to increase its asset-purchase fund, it’s main policy tool, to 66 trillion yen on Oct. 30. The central bank also said it would offer unlimited loans to banks. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said Sept. 13 that the central bank would purchase $40 billion of mortgage bonds a month until an economic recovery is well-established, on top of two earlier rounds of bond purchases totaling $2.3 trillion from December 2008 and June 2011. ECB President Mario Draghi said on Sept. 6 that policy makers agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase program to regain control of interest rates in the euro area and fight speculation of a currency breakup. ‘High Volatility’ “If you believe that an activist central bank will keep fighting, that suggests growth, which also means high liquidity and low volatility,” Shahab Jalinoos, a Stamford , Connecticut- based senior currency strategist at UBS AG, said in a Nov. 8 telephone interview. “If you think that you don’t have an activist central bank, or have one whose hands are tied by something, then you probably will see high volatility.” Confidence among U.S. consumers climbed to a five-year high in November, while payrolls expanded by 171,000 workers in October, exceeding the highest forecast in a Bloomberg survey. China’s services industries rebounded in October from the slowest expansion in at least 19 months, adding to manufacturing gains. Meanwhile, growth in Brazil , the largest emerging economy after China, will average 1.5 percent this year, less than the U.S. or Japan, according to 30 economists’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The European Commission said the euro-area economy will stagnate next year as the sovereign-debt crisis engulfing southern Europe begins to slow export-driven Germany. “This is going to be a very slow recovery process,” Wells Fargo’s Bennenbroek said. “Neither the official institutions, nor the private investors, are looking for a strong rebound from the major economies in any near- to medium-term time frame.” To contact the reporter on this story: Joseph Ciolli in New York at  jciolli@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Dave Liedtka at  dliedtka@bloomberg.net",['Joseph Ciolli'],"Carry Trades Lose Most Since ’11 as HSBC Gauge Warns: Currencies The foreign-exchange market is signaling more pain ahead for currencies that benefit from a sustained global recovery, five years after the onset of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. HSBC Holdings Plc’s Global Hazard Indicator, which combines implied volatility readings in options for the dollar, euro and yen, shows wider price swings in currencies over the next year than in the coming three months. If history is any guide, that means the dollar and yen will strengthen and higher-yielding, higher-risk currencies such as the Brazilian real and South African rand will depreciate. While reports in the U.S. show gains in jobs and consumer confidence , and data from China signal that services industries are rebounding from 19-month lows , foreign-exchange speculation is a losing bet. The UBS V24 Carry Index that tracks profits from the so-called carry trade, where money borrowed in low- yielding currencies is used to buy those from nations with higher rates, is at about the lowest level since early 2011. “The market is not yet fully convinced that we are back to normal trading conditions, and sees the potential for renewed turbulence in 2013,” said Daragh Maher , a strategist at HSBC in London. “There are plenty of potential triggers for renewed volatility on the horizon,” he said, citing potential spending cuts and tax increases in the U.S., the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and political change in China. Easy Profits Investing the proceeds of dollar-denominated loans should offer easy profits because the Fed has said it probably will keep the target rate for overnight lending between banks near zero through mid-2015. The carry trade can lose money when the currency used to fund the strategy strengthens, or the targeted currency weakens, or some combination. Instead, selling borrowed dollars to buy reais in Brazil, where the target interest rate is 7.25 percent, has lost about 5 percent this year as the real tumbled 23 percent from its 2012 high in February as of 1:44 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

India’s current-account deficit widened to a record $32.6 billion, equivalent to 6.7 percent of gross domestic product, in the three months ended Dec. 31 as oil and gold imports surged. The $1.8 trillion economy will probably expand 5 percent, the slowest pace in a decade, in the financial year ending March 31, the government estimates. On the current-account deficit: “My sense is that the fourth quarter current-account will be significantly narrower than third quarter, because our exports have done better. Unless there is some significant dips the most recent March numbers, we should be on track for a significant narrowing of current account deficit. “The quarterly deficit will come down from 6.7 percent. The year-on-year deficit will be around 5 percent. Those are the estimates out there and I don’t dispute those estimates. Even 5 percent is much too large.” India ’s fiscal year ends March 13. On inflation: “Core inflation has been contained at very subdued levels. The number for the year is 3.8 percent. That has been brought under control. The big issue now is to bring food prices under control. We have to wait and see what happens with the harvest. The indicator for the harvest is that it’s stronger than earlier estimates. So I’m hopeful that we’ll get some breathing space from food inflation.” On India’s growth forecast: “The next fiscal year we’ve made a projection of 6.1 to 6.7 percent. We still hold to that.

ISO Sees Bearish Sugar Market in 2012-13 on Rising World Surplus,['Isis Almeida'],2012-11-15 18:28:44,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/iso-sees-bearish-sugar-market-in-2012-13-on-rising-world-surplus.html,"Global sugar prices, which fell 18 percent this year, may remain “under bearish pressure” until the end of the season that started last month because of a rising surplus, according to the International Sugar Organization.

That follows a surplus of about 7 million tons a year earlier, according to the report. Global production will climb to a record 177.6 million tons this season as output expands in top producer Brazil, the ISO said. “In 2012-13, a record high global total can be largely attributed to a projected recovery in the world’s leading producer,” the ISO said in the report. “World market prices could remain under bearish pressure until the end of the current October-to-September crop cycle.” Global sugar consumption will be 171.4 million tons in 2012-13. That is higher than 168.1 million tons in 2011-12 and lower that the group’s August forecast of 171.5 million tons. Stockpiles at the end of the season will be 5.3 percent higher than previously estimated at 66.3 million tons, the ISO estimates. Inventories were 65.3 million tons in 2011-12. “Assuming that most of the projected trade surplus well in excess of 5 million tons is added to stocks at the end of the season, the stocks-to-consumption ratio would rise above 40 percent,” the ISO said. “The period of low stocks environment, one of the main market characteristics for four seasons from 2008-09 to 2011-12, is likely to be over.” Sugar output in Brazil will climb to 38.5 million tons in the 2013-14 season that starts there in April, the group forecast.

There’s No Iron in Putin’s Curtain,['Leonid Bershidsky'],2012-09-26 14:35:44,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/there-s-no-iron-in-putin-s-curtain.html,"The Cold War is back. Russia 's moves to expel the U.S. Agency for International Development and effectively strip U.S.-funded Radio Liberty of its broadcast license are just the latest manifestations of a harsh reality: In today's Moscow, any connection with the U.S. practically guarantees bureaucratic problems. There's not yet any real iron, though, in President Vladimir Putin 's anti-American curtain. The Kremlin's hostile moves have only a symbolic significance in a world where finance is global and the Internet is freely accessible. On Sept. 19, Russia's Foreign Ministry ordered USAID to shut down in Russia by Oct. 1, saying that its work failed to further its stated purpose of “developing bilateral humanitarian cooperation.” As a ministry spokesman put it : “We are talking about attempts to affect political processes, including elections."" From 2004 to 2010, USAID spent $601 million in Russia on programs in fields varying from reproductive health to disaster prevention. Only $20 million of that went to non-U.S. organizations for the purpose of developing “government and civil society.” This relatively small area of USAID's operations has become a big nuisance for Putin's regime. One of the grant recipients, an organization called Golos (Russian for ""voice""), used the money to construct a nationwide map of electoral irregularities during the December 2011 parliamentary election. On election day, unidentified hackers attacked the website running the map, so Golos moved its data to the Google cloud. Golos became the most authoritative source on the shenanigans that led to a landslide victory for the pro-Putin United Russia party, which now enjoys a majority in Parliament. The rigged election gave rise to mass protests that emboldened Russia's feeble political opposition. Golos went on to document more evidence of fraud in the March elections that brought Putin back to the presidency. Its map of transgressions became a permanent project, following all kinds of procedural breaches in elections at all levels. Golos was preparing to update the map with the results of local elections to be held Oct. 14, but that is now unlikely to happen. “We will not find a new source of money that soon,” Golos head Lilia Shibanova told the news website Gazeta.ru. She said she believes that the expulsion of USAID had everything to do with her project: “Just to stop Golos observing elections they had to kill all the vast support USAID provides, including that of Russian government programs.” Even Putin's party, United Russia, benefited from USAID funding over the years, according to U.S. State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland. United Russia issued vehement denials , but former member Sergei Markov admitted that the Public Chamber, an assembly of public figures and activists loyal to Putin, had held round-table discussions with USAID funding. As Markov told the news site Lenta.ru , the fact that he  “might have eaten a few lunches paid for by USAID"" did not make him a foreign agent. If lunching on USAID's tab does not make one a CIA agent, spending its money on election-monitoring websites apparently does, at least in the eyes of the Putin administration and its propaganda machine. Shutting down USAID “is an excellent decision by the Russian government. And Washington ’s immediate and virulent reaction only confirms that Russia is right on target,” wrote pundit Veronika Krasheninnikova on the website of the government-funded, English-language TV channel Russia Today. She went on to point out that USAID Russia head Charles North had graduated from the National War College with a degree in national security strategy. “Russia must take care of its own civil society,” Krasheninnikova concluded. The projects funded by USAID might not go away quite as fast as Russian officials hope. Columnist Dmitry Kamyshev, writing on the website openspace.ru, noted that if the U.S. government wanted to keep funding the same Russian projects, it could do so through intermediaries. “Obviously, the Kremlin could cut off those channels if it really wanted to,” he wrote. “But in the modern world the only way to do this is by pulling down a financial 'iron curtain' that would be difficult to reconcile with the reality of a global economy and the principles of the World Trade Organization , which Russia has just joined with great difficulty.” Consider, for example, Radio Liberty. Officially, it is getting the boot from Russia, but its Russian audience will not lose access to its content. Liberty broadcast in the AM frequency range in Russia for a little over 20 years after being allowed to do so by Russia's first president. It will cease to do so on Nov. 10, thanks to a law that forbids foreigners to own more than 48 percent of a broadcaster. Rather than try to set up an eligible Russian entity, Liberty has chosen to give up the broadcasting license and concentrate on improving its website and Internet radio service. Liberty has brought in a new Moscow bureau chief, Masha Gessen, a fiercely anti-Putin journalist who wrote a book about the Russian president titled “The Man Without a Face.” She is expected to oversee Liberty's transformation into a modern multimedia service. By the end of this year, Golos, too, is highly likely to resume its election-watching activities. This will leave Putin's regime with a tough choice: Admit defeat, or double down with stringent internet censorship and the kind of “financial iron curtain” that Kamyshev described. Given the ferocity of anti-Western rhetoric in Moscow these days, the latter scenario is not unthinkable. (Leonid Bershidsky, an editor and novelist, is Moscow and Kiev correspondent for World View.

Energy Efficiency Can Buy Five Years for Climate Deal,['Mathew Carr'],2012-11-12 17:56:18,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/energy-efficiency-can-buy-5-years-for-climate-deal-iea.html,"Adopting measures to promote energy efficiency can buy the world an additional five years to seal a climate-protection deal and would amount to a low-cost “hidden fuel,” the International Energy Agency said. Energy efficiency can be described that way because “you can’t sell it, you can’t buy it or put it in your tank,” Maria van der Hoeven, executive director of the Paris-based agency, said today at a presentation of its World Energy Outlook report in London. “Efficiency in energy use is just as important to our energy future as unconstrained energy supply .” Top Sustainability News: Under current policies, nations need a climate agreement by 2017, when energy infrastructure will probably produce, or lock in, all emissions allowable by 2035 at a level consistent with preventing dangerous global warming, the agency said in the report. Adopting efficiency measures now may allow the world to keep temperatures from rising 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 Fahrenheit) or even 2 degrees, the IEA said. “Rapid deployment of energy-efficient technologies, as in our Efficient-World Scenario, would postpone this complete lock in to 2022, buying time to secure a much-needed global agreement to cut greenhouse-gas emissions,” the agency said. United Nations envoys from almost 200 nations meet Nov. 26 in Doha to help fix a global climate deal by 2015 for the period starting 2020. Countries have so far failed to agree whether to extend or replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , which has emissions targets for some richer nations through this year. Emissions Savings Total emissions from energy in 2020 would be 32 billion metric tons in 2020 under the Efficient-World Scenario, which assumes that all improvements that are economically viable are made and regulators introduce measures to overcome barriers to efficiency, according to the IEA. That’s 7.5 percent less than under the New Policies Scenario, the agency’s central scenario that assumes nations adopt announced policies for climate protection and energy security. Under the efficient scenario, consumer spending on energy in 2020 will be $8.066 trillion, 5.4 percent less than under the central scenario, the IEA said.

EU Antitrust Review of BAE-EADS Deal May Face Legal Limit,['Aoife White'],2012-09-27 14:39:21,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/eu-antitrust-review-of-bae-eads-deal-may-face-legal-limit.html,"European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. (EAD) ’s planned merger with BAE Systems Plc (BA/) may escape a full review by European Union regulators because governments can exempt defense-industry deals from antitrust scrutiny. EU law has a military carve-out clause for the defense industry that allows member countries to exempt companies from having to seek approval for a takeover from European Commission overseers, said Alec Burnside, a lawyer at Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft LLP in Brussels. “It’s traditionally an area of frustration for the commission when it gets locked out of military mergers and it has always tried to discourage member states from blocking” any probe, Burnside said, though any government order would only cover “purely military aspects” of the tie-up. “Products with dual civilian-military use, and civilian activities, will still have to be notified to the European Commission,” he said. EADS, the parent of Airbus, is negotiating with Germany, France , Spain , the U.K. and the U.S. on the merger, which would create the largest civil-aviation and defense company, with a combined market value of $45 billion. Management seeking approval of the deal must persuade officials in France, which owns a direct stake in EADS, and the U.K., which can veto any change of ownership in BAE. BAE-Marconi The U.K. government cited national security issues to exempt BAE’s 1999 purchase of General Electric Co.’s Marconi defense unit from a commission merger review. The EU’s antitrust agency approved non-defense aspects of the deal in 2000. The French, Spanish and German governments didn’t exempt the companies that formed EADS from a 2000 EU review. Lindsay Walls, a spokeswoman for BAE, said the completion of any transaction would be subject to a range of governmental and regulatory consents. She declined to comment on any details because discussions are continuing. EADS declined to comment on regulatory approvals of the deal because negotiations are still at an early stage. The commission also declined to comment on the merger review or a possible review of the government shareholdings. The exemption can’t be used by governments to avoid any potential antitrust concerns and must only be raised if they see security issues, said Stephen Mavroghenis, a lawyer at Shearman & Sterling LLP in Brussels. ‘Strictly Construed’ “It will be strictly construed and it can be reviewed by the European Court of Justice,” he said. “It would look odd if one state were to say it was in their security interests and the other ones didn’t, but they don’t all have to agree to it.” EU regulators, usually responsible for approving Europe- wide takeovers and enforcing the right to do business across the bloc, have been careful about any involvement in the defense industry because of the legal exemption, said Clara O’Donnell, an analyst at the London-based Centre for European Reform. The military opt-out may also affect EU rules that condemn special rights for government shareholders, known as golden shares, “simply because it’s an area where traditionally governments have been allowed to do what they want,” she said. “In military cases, it can be pretty hard to contest” that such shares are needed to protect government interests, Burnside said. Government Reviews German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande are reviewing the proposed transaction intensively, Merkel told reporters on Sept. 22. Hollande said jobs, industrial strategy and the interests of both countries were at stake. U.K. Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said the government’s special share in BAE means the company will have to prove the deal defends British interest and jobs, the Guardian reported earlier this month. Governments would be denied a role in operating decisions in the merged company, and the special shares being offered to states would be limited to 15 percent voting rights, Germany’s economy ministry said in a document obtained by Bloomberg News. The commission has said such stakes may deter investment in the 27-nation bloc. EU regulators revived legal action last year against Germany ’s so-called Volkswagen Law that allows the state of Lower Saxony to veto any takeover of the carmaker. A bigger regulatory obstacle to the deal may be the U.S., which is “sensitive about who is the owner” of defense- equipment suppliers, said O’Donnell. Any requirement for BAE to sell off U.S. businesses would be a challenge because those units are a significant source of its earnings, she said.

Moody’s Sees Local Default as $21 Billion Matures: China Credit,['Kyoungwha Kim' 'Yanping Li'],2013-07-26 03:09:33,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/moody-s-sees-local-default-as-21-billion-matures-china-credit.html,"Local-government financing vehicles need to repay a record amount of debt this year, prompting Moody’s Investors Service to warn Premier Li Keqiang may set an example by allowing China ’s first onshore bond default. Some 127 billion yuan ($21 billion) of so-called LGFV notes expire in the second half, according to Everbright Securities Co., the most in its data going back to 2000 and more than double the 62.7 billion yuan that matured in the first six months. The yield premium over top-rated notes for one-year AA debt, the most common rating for LGFVs, widened to 67 basis points yesterday, the highest level since Jan. 16, Chinabond data show. The comparable gap in India is 47. “With bonds approaching maturity, the weaker ones will have some problems as cash flows that they generate are very weak,” said Christine Kuo, a Moody’s analyst in Hong Kong. “I wouldn’t rule out the possibility of the government showcasing some companies to go under.” Refinancing will be a challenge after corporate bond sales slumped to a two-year low in the second quarter and policy makers cracked down on shadow banking activities that bypass regulatory limits on lending. Premier Li is seeking to shift the focus of the world’s second-largest economy away from government-led investment and China this month cut taxes for small businesses and eased controls on bank lending rates. Next year, 208.8 billion yuan of LGFV debt comes due, up 10 percent from this year and 122 percent than in 2012, according to Shanghai-based Everbright. Guotai Junan Securities Co., which uses a different classification system, estimates a record 160 billion yuan of the debt matures both this year and next, up from 110 billion yuan in 2012. ‘High Alert’ The investment arms in the city of Ordos, Inner Mongolia have amassed 240 billion yuan of debt and some district governments there are struggling to repay debt and pay workers, according to a magazine published by the Xinhua News Agency this month. Local governments set up more than 10,000 LGFVs to fund the construction of roads, sewage plants and subways after they were barred from directly issuing bonds under a 1994 budget law. A 4 trillion yuan stimulus plan during the 2008-09 financial crisis swelled loans to the companies, which they have been rolling over or refinancing with new note sales. LGFVs may hold more than 20 trillion yuan of debt, former Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said in April. That’s double the figure given by the National Audit Office in 2011. The government must be on “high alert” to the dangers of their rising borrowings, Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao warned on July 5, after central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said in March that about 20 percent of the debt is risky. Yield Jump The yield on one-year securities rated AA surged 112 basis points last month in an interbank cash squeeze, the most on record, to 5.54 percent and was 5.59 percent yesterday. The benchmark one-year treasury yield increased three basis points this month to 3.51 percent after a 61 basis-point jump in June. “We remain bearish on AA-or-below-rated LGFV notes as they heavily depend on borrowings to repay debts,” said Zhao Bowen, a credit analyst at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. in Beijing. “Should the government remain tight on sales, LGFVs face a greater risk of default. Once one goes broke, the fall could lead to a domino effect among the weaker LGFVs and cause a systemic risk.” To limit the fallout, he forecast the government will help approve bond sales for selected companies. China will support local governments in raising funds for shantytown redevelopment, the Finance Ministry said this week. Policy makers also expanded a trial that allows regional authorities to directly sell bonds to include Jiangsu and Shandong provinces earlier this month. ‘Moral Hazard’ Zhao said the average yield of AA-rated LGFV notes may climb to 7 percent this quarter from the current range of 6.3 percent to 6.5 percent. Most LGFV bonds are rated AA and above, according to Bank of America Corp. The yield on Lishui City Construction Investment Co.’s notes due May 2020 climbed 25 basis points this month to 6.26 percent yesterday, China Interbank Funding Center prices show. Liaoyang City Assets Operation & Management Co.’s November 2019 bonds yielded 7.53 percent, 73 basis points more than at the end of June, according to Shanghai Stock Exchange prices. Rising borrowing costs for LGFVs reflect uncertainty that the central government will bail them out in case of distress, said Bin Gao, BOA’s head of Asia-Pacific rates research in Hong Kong. “The government has more willingness to allow some kind of restructuring or default to reduce moral hazard,” he said. Painful Reform Premier Li described reform as the “biggest dividend for China” in his first press conference on March 17 and said that cutting the government’s power was a “self-imposed revolution,” that would “be very painful and even feel like cutting one’s wrist.” Policy makers refrained from adding cash to the banking system, sending interbank money rates to a record last month. Total financing, the broadest measure of credit, slid to 1.04 trillion yuan in June, the least since April 2012, as policy makers curbed unregulated lending. The authorities are focusing instead on financial reforms to revive the economy after growth slowed to 7.5 percent last quarter. China scrapped a floor for banks’ lending rates on July 19, raised the limit for foreign investment in capital markets on July 12 and is planning to set up a pilot free-trade zone in Shanghai. The State Council approved tax breaks for small companies this week and said railway construction will be accelerated to support the economy. Issuance Slump Corporate bond sales fell to 219 billion yuan in the last three months, the least since the third quarter of 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. LGFVs’ issuance slipped to 53.5 billion yuan in June from 93.5 billion yuan in May, according to data from Everbright Securities. The decline came after the National Development and Reform Commission restricted bond-sale applications from LGFVs in April. Li Qing, a credit analyst at Guotai Junan in Shanghai, predicted issuance by LGFVs will remain around or below 50 billion yuan a month in the second half, while Zhao at Shenyin & Wanguo forecast a rebound from this quarter onwards. There have been no defaults in the publicly traded domestic debt market since the central bank started regulating it in 1997, according to Moody’s. The possibility of the first is making it more expensive to insure Chinese bond holdings using credit-default swaps. Five-year contracts on sovereign debt rose 45 basis points this year to 112 in New York , according to CMA prices. They reached 147 last month, the highest since January 2012. The yuan weakened 0.17 percent since reaching a 19-year high of 6.1210 per dollar on May 27 in Shanghai. The rate was at 6.1326 today. “The amount of bonds set to mature is getting bigger while the financial situation of LGFVs is getting worse and worse,” Bank of Amercia’s Gao said. “We do think there’s a higher chance for some LGFV bonds not to be paid back.” To contact the reporters on this story: Kyoungwha Kim in Singapore at  kkim19@bloomberg.net ; Yanping Li in Singapore at  yli16@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: James Regan at  jregan19@bloomberg.net ; Ven Ram at  vram1@bloomberg.net",['Kyoungwha KimYanping Li'],"Moody’s Sees Local Default as $21 Billion Matures: China Credit Local-government financing vehicles need to repay a record amount of debt this year, prompting Moody’s Investors Service to warn Premier Li Keqiang may set an example by allowing China ’s first onshore bond default.

Microsoft Deploys College-Kid Cool in Windows 8 Apps Race: Tech,['Dina Bass'],2012-09-21 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/microsoft-deploys-college-kid-cool-in-windows-8-apps-race-tech.html,"Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is forging a future in tablets with students like Joe Shapiro, a computer science major who had never crafted applications for the company’s Windows software until he won an internship to try it out. Shapiro, a senior at Brown University , spent the summer in the Foundry paid internship program at Microsoft’s New England Research & Development Center , known as NERD. He helped build a commuter-transit app, Catch It, that should be available for download later this month in the online store for Windows 8, the new tablet-friendly version of Microsoft’s flagship operating system. And, crucial to Microsoft’s ambitions, he plans to make more apps. Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, designed Windows 8 for touch-screen technology included in the company’s first tablet, Surface, and other devices coming this year. To gain share in tablets, a market expected by DisplaySearch to reach $66.4 billion in 2012, Microsoft needs enough apps to challenge the more than 200,000 available for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad. “The apps ecosystem is probably the single most important factor in a customer’s experience,” said Al Hilwa, an analyst at market researcher IDC. “It dictates what books you read, what music you listen to, what movies you see, what social activities you take part in. Problem is, you can’t have half a million apps overnight.” Interns, also deployed to write prototype apps for the Windows 8 preview last year, produced six apps through Foundry, generating enough interest among computer science students for the company to make the pilot program permanent. Using student recruits is one way Microsoft can woo app developers who are used to building programs for mobile phones and tablets, where the company has little and no share, respectively. ‘College Struggle’ “Microsoft has struggled to get college kids interested in developing for Windows,” said Wes Miller, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, who is based in Kirkland, Washington. Luring programmers before graduation is particularly critical for recruitment in the U.S., which lags behind countries such as India and China in its ability to crank out qualified engineers. The U.S. ranks 23rd among developed nations in the percentage of students with undergraduate degrees in science or engineering who are employed in related fields, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported last year. The report analyzed employment trends for people age 25 to 34. Like their counterparts already in the workforce, student developers have focused programming efforts on apps for Apple’s iOS software, which powers the iPad, and Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system, used in an array of handheld devices, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s Kindle. Microsoft’s version of the Surface tablet that is most comparable to the iPad won’t be able to run older Windows apps, forcing developers to start from scratch. ‘Playing Catch-Up’ Windows 8 is the first Microsoft operating system that will work on computers running chips based on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology. These chips are widely used in mobile devices, including the iPad. The ARM-based products will run only apps designed specifically for the new version of Windows -- and none of the programs already available for Microsoft software on machines made for Intel Corp. (INTC) ’s chips. “Microsoft is definitely playing catch-up with respect to the global app marketplace,” said David Hilal, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, in an interview. “Their challenge is a chicken-and-egg problem. They need to get more users for their apps to entice developers, but they need better apps to attract more users.” Enter NERD interns to help fill the void. This summer’s group of 21 interns produced three apps already in the Windows store, and two more that are expected to follow soon. Intern-Built One of the intern-built apps is Trackage, which enables users to locate packages shipped by FedEx Corp. (FDX) , United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , the U.S. Postal Service and LaserShip Inc. using a single app rather than having to go to each service’s website separately. Another, Never Late, is an alarm clock app. Inkarus is a physics game in which users collect gears and feathers to help a chubby penguin build a flying machine that must steer clear of things like antigravity fields and rainstorms. The NERD building, located in Cambridge’s Kendall Square, lets Microsoft maintain a base near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University as well as offices belonging to Google, VMware Inc. (VMW) and other biotechnology and venture capital firms. Parts of the facility, which also houses a research lab and some of Microsoft’s Office employees, was designed by Ray Ozzie, former chief technology officer at the company. Intern desks have stunning views of the Charles River. Walls are adorned with banners from an advertising campaign Microsoft ran in places such as Boston ’s subway, with lines like “Softwayah” -- or software pronounced with a Boston accent. Shapiro’s App The app that Shapiro and two other students built for Boston public transit may be available in Microsoft’s online store by the end of the month. Shapiro, now well-versed in Microsoft’s C# programming language, wants to make more. “I’m a completely C# convert now,” Shapiro said. “I never want to go back.” Another intern-made app, FaceReel, also awaits approval. It uses facial-recognition software to generate videos out of a set of images -- think of it as a way to create a birthday or 50th- anniversary video without all the complicated editing or PowerPoint work. FaceReel was made by a team that included Jancarlo Perez and Jasmine Huynh, students at MIT who, like Shapiro, hadn’t worked on apps for Windows prior to the internship. They, too, plan to develop Windows apps again. Perez described the Windows 8 development environment as “fast and fluid,” echoing the oft-repeated phrase Microsoft executives have used to describe the program. App Exposure NERD interns who later opt for a career making apps for Microsoft may find it’s easier to get exposure for their work because the field isn’t as crowded as it is for apps built for Apple or Google operating systems, said Hilal, the FBR analyst. “As an app developer, you take a little bit of a leap of faith today with Microsoft,” Hilal said. “You can get a lot of downloads with Apple, but there’s a lot of competition.” Beyond fostering a desire to work at Microsoft, NERD aims to create a devoted group of Windows 8 converts who will spread their enthusiasm among fellow computer science majors and design students. “Because Windows 8 is pre-release, it’s been so exciting to get my hands on it before other people have been able to,” said Emily Lin, a media arts and sciences major at Wellesley College , who served as the designer on the Catch It team. “When I tell my friends, they say, ‘That’s so cool that you are getting to develop on Windows 8.’ ” To contact the reporter on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at  dbass2@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net",['Dina Bass'],"Microsoft Deploys College-Kid Cool in Windows 8 Apps Race: Tech Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is forging a future in tablets with students like Joe Shapiro, a computer science major who had never crafted applications for the company’s Windows software until he won an internship to try it out. Shapiro, a senior at Brown University , spent the summer in the Foundry paid internship program at Microsoft’s New England Research & Development Center , known as NERD. He helped build a commuter-transit app, Catch It, that should be available for download later this month in the online store for Windows 8, the new tablet-friendly version of Microsoft’s flagship operating system. And, crucial to Microsoft’s ambitions, he plans to make more apps. Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, designed Windows 8 for touch-screen technology included in the company’s first tablet, Surface, and other devices coming this year. To gain share in tablets, a market expected by DisplaySearch to reach $66.4 billion in 2012, Microsoft needs enough apps to challenge the more than 200,000 available for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad. “The apps ecosystem is probably the single most important factor in a customer’s experience,” said Al Hilwa, an analyst at market researcher IDC. “It dictates what books you read, what music you listen to, what movies you see, what social activities you take part in. Problem is, you can’t have half a million apps overnight.” Interns, also deployed to write prototype apps for the Windows 8 preview last year, produced six apps through Foundry, generating enough interest among computer science students for the company to make the pilot program permanent. Using student recruits is one way Microsoft can woo app developers who are used to building programs for mobile phones and tablets, where the company has little and no share, respectively. ‘College Struggle’ “Microsoft has struggled to get college kids interested in developing for Windows,” said Wes Miller, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, who is based in Kirkland, Washington. Luring programmers before graduation is particularly critical for recruitment in the U.S., which lags behind countries such as India and China in its ability to crank out qualified engineers. The U.S. ranks 23rd among developed nations in the percentage of students with undergraduate degrees in science or engineering who are employed in related fields, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported last year. The report analyzed employment trends for people age 25 to 34. Like their counterparts already in the workforce, student developers have focused programming efforts on apps for Apple’s iOS software, which powers the iPad, and Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system, used in an array of handheld devices, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s Kindle. Microsoft’s version of the Surface tablet that is most comparable to the iPad won’t be able to run older Windows apps, forcing developers to start from scratch. ‘Playing Catch-Up’ Windows 8 is the first Microsoft operating system that will work on computers running chips based on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology. These chips are widely used in mobile devices, including the iPad. The ARM-based products will run only apps designed specifically for the new version of Windows -- and none of the programs already available for Microsoft software on machines made for Intel Corp. (INTC) ’s chips. “Microsoft is definitely playing catch-up with respect to the global app marketplace,” said David Hilal, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, in an interview. “Their challenge is a chicken-and-egg problem. They need to get more users for their apps to entice developers, but they need better apps to attract more users.” Enter NERD interns to help fill the void. This summer’s group of 21 interns produced three apps already in the Windows store, and two more that are expected to follow soon. Intern-Built One of the intern-built apps is Trackage, which enables users to locate packages shipped by FedEx Corp. (FDX) , United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , the U.S. Postal Service and LaserShip Inc. using a single app rather than having to go to each service’s website separately. Another, Never Late, is an alarm clock app. Inkarus is a physics game in which users collect gears and feathers to help a chubby penguin build a flying machine that must steer clear of things like antigravity fields and rainstorms. The NERD building, located in Cambridge’s Kendall Square, lets Microsoft maintain a base near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University as well as offices belonging to Google, VMware Inc. (VMW) and other biotechnology and venture capital firms. Parts of the facility, which also houses a research lab and some of Microsoft’s Office employees, was designed by Ray Ozzie, former chief technology officer at the company. Intern desks have stunning views of the Charles River. Walls are adorned with banners from an advertising campaign Microsoft ran in places such as Boston ’s subway, with lines like “Softwayah” -- or software pronounced with a Boston accent. Shapiro’s App The app that Shapiro and two other students built for Boston public transit may be available in Microsoft’s online store by the end of the month. Shapiro, now well-versed in Microsoft’s C# programming language, wants to make more. “I’m a completely C# convert now,” Shapiro said. “I never want to go back.” Another intern-made app, FaceReel, also awaits approval. It uses facial-recognition software to generate videos out of a set of images -- think of it as a way to create a birthday or 50th- anniversary video without all the complicated editing or PowerPoint work. FaceReel was made by a team that included Jancarlo Perez and Jasmine Huynh, students at MIT who, like Shapiro, hadn’t worked on apps for Windows prior to the internship. They, too, plan to develop Windows apps again. Perez described the Windows 8 development environment as “fast and fluid,” echoing the oft-repeated phrase Microsoft executives have used to describe the program.

Under the accord, the London-based bank also agreed to install a monitor for two years, according to a statement today from Benjamin Lawsky , head of the New York Department of Financial Services. Lawsky said his agency will “continue to work with our federal and state partners on this matter.” Regulators including the U.S. Treasury , the Federal Reserve Bank, the Justice Department and the Manhattan district attorney continue to work on a comprehensive agreement involving the transfers, which involved $250 billion over a six-year period. The bank “continues to engage with the other U.S. agencies on their review of the Group’s historical U.S. sanctions compliance,” Standard Chartered said today in a separate statement, referring to itself as “the Group.” Standard Chartered said it “cannot predict when this review and these discussions will be completed or what the outcome will be and therefore potential liabilities cannot be reasonably quantified at this point.” As part of the agreement, the bank will hire people in its New York branch to oversee and audit anti-money-laundering procedures. August Order On Aug. 6, Lawsky, 42, issued an order accusing Standard Chartered of helping Iran launder about $250 billion in violation of federal laws. One analyst estimated that the loss of the bank’s New York license could result in a 40 percent drop in earnings. Standard Chartered generates almost 90 percent of its profit and revenue in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The settlement amount is the largest ever paid to an individual regulator as part of a money-laundering accord. In June, ING Bank NV agreed to pay $619 million to settle similar allegations. That sum was split evenly between the federal government and the Manhattan district attorney’s office.

U.K. Regulator Rebuffs Co-Op Bank Bondholders’ Call for Review,['Howard Mustoe'],2013-07-26 11:40:42,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/u-k-regulator-rebuffs-co-op-bank-bondholders-call-for-review.html,"The Prudential Regulation Authority rebuffed calls from a group of Co-Operative Bank Plc bondholders for a review of the U.K. lender’s restructuring plan, telling them how the company raises money is up to its management. Co-Operative Bank said last month it will swap some debt for equity as part of a plan to raise 1.5 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) of capital after the failure of its bid for 632 Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) branches exposed the deficit. The bank has about 7,000 bondholders with holdings of 25,000 pounds or less. Mark Taber, organizer of a group of bondholders, wrote on July 9 to Andrew Bailey , the PRA’s chief executive officer, asking for a review of the lender’s plan. His group is one of at least three seeking better terms for bondholders in the restructuring. “The PRA has always been clear that the way in which that extra capital was to be raised was a matter for the Co-Operative Bank itself,” Bailey said in a letter to Taber on July 23 seen by Bloomberg News. Bailey declined to comment on why the Co-Operative Bank’s auditor, KPMG LLP, indicated that the bank was well-capitalised in accounts published in March. He reiterated regulators told the lender it should have raised capital in 2011. He declined to give additional details, citing confidentiality agreements. Sarah Bailey, a spokeswoman for the PRA, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for KPMG also declined to immediately comment. Regulator’s Approval Taber said he has responded to Bailey, saying the terms of the lender’s perpetual subordinated bonds require consent from regulators for repurchase. “It is therefore completely within the power of the PRA to influence the terms of any offer made to holders of the bank’s retail bonds,” Taber wrote. Co-Operative Bank’s capital has been depleted by soured consumer and commercial real estate loans stemming from the purchase of Britannia Building Society in 2009. Loan impairments more than quadrupled to 468.7 million pounds in 2012, the company said in March. The bank had a pretax loss of 673.7 million pounds in 2012.

TransCanada Pipeline Foes to Camp Out Before U.S. Hearing,['Katarzyna Klimasinska'],2011-10-06 20:03:20,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/transcanada-oil-pipeline-foes-to-camp-out-before-u-s-hearing-on-keystone.html,"Opponents of TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone XL pipeline said protesters will sleep outside the site in Washington of the final public hearing on the project to ensure they get a seat tomorrow while a rally is held outside. A hearing last month in Nebraska , one of six states the pipeline will cross, drew hundreds of protesters saying the $7 billion project threatens the Ogallala aquifer, which supplies 30 percent of the water used in the U.S. for agriculture. In Washington, actress Daryl Hannah and James Hansen , head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, were among those arrested at sit-ins in front of the White House in August. “We are fearful that the industry will actually pay people to go and stand the line for them, so that they can fill the hearing with industry spokespeople,” Maura Cowley, a co- director of the Washington-based Energy Action Coalition , said in an interview today. “We’re sleeping on the streets of Washington D.C. tonight to quite literally block the ability of the industry to impact the hearing.” TransCanada plans to build the 1,661-mile (2,673-kilometer) pipeline to transport Canadian oil from Alberta to Texas refineries. The State Department, which is holding the public hearing tomorrow as part of a review because the project crosses an international border, has said it expects to make a final decision on whether to grant approval this year. The Calgary-based company isn’t paying anyone to pack the audience, Terry Cunha, a spokesman, said in a telephone interview today. Labor Backers “Everyone is entitled to appear” and “express their opinion,” Cunha said. “We’re aware that many local labor groups will be participating to highlight” that the project “will generate thousands of much-needed jobs across the United States .” Pipeline construction will immediately create 20,000 jobs and increased investment in Canadian oil sand may add 500,000 jobs in the U.S. in the next two decades, Jack Gerard , president of the Washington-based American Petroleum Institute , said in a phone interview today. Development of Canada ’s oil sands, coupled with increased production from U.S. fields, would ease U.S. dependence on crude shipments from the Middle East in about 15 years, Gerard also said. The State Department didn’t immediately return a phone call today requesting comment on the planned protests. Reagan Building Cowley said 35 to 60 demonstrators may gather tonight at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, where the hearing will be be held. Cowley said she expects the rally to draw as many as 1,000 pipeline critics.

Clinton is now secretary of state. The e-mails are evidence of the State Department’s pro-industry bias, Friends of the Earth said on Sept. 22.

A proposed amendment to the EU emissions trading law, the first element of the plan to delay some auctions of carbon permits proposed by the European Commission, may lead to a situation where the bloc’s regulator seeks similar intervention in other policy areas, Korolec said in an interview in Brussels. “The legal quality of the amendment is problematic,” he said. “I think there will be more countries and members of the European Parliament who will have doubts about giving a blank check to the commission.” At stake is curbing an oversupply in the EU emissions trading system, the world’s biggest, after carbon prices fell to a record low earlier this year on a glut that is equal to almost a half of the average annual pollution limit in the program. The commission has repeatedly said the EU law gives it a mandate to propose the auctioning timeline when the bloc moves to more sales of permits as of 2013. The proposed law change reasserts the commission’s rights and is aimed at removing uncertainty about the supply curbs, it has said. Member states will need more time to discuss the plan after two meetings of national climate advisers earlier this month didn’t bring a breakthrough and “many nations” don’t have official positions on the proposal yet, Korolec said.

The committee was scheduled to discuss the second element of the commission’s plan: a measure to delay a yet unspecified number of carbon permits at auctions as of 2013. Poland finds the auction delay, also known as the backloading proposal, “unacceptable,” Korolec said. “It would mean that the ETS is no longer a market mechanism,” he said. “It’ll be central planning.” Both the draft amendment and the backloading regulation need qualified majority support from member states to pass.

Serb Central Bank Says Lenders Coped With Fund Withdrawal,['Misha Savic'],2012-11-15 17:12:47,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/serb-central-bank-says-lenders-coped-with-fund-withdrawal.html,"Serbia’s banking industry has adjusted to the withdrawal of funds from lenders based outside the country, the Balkan nation’s central bank said. Serbian banks with parents based overseas made up 74 percent of the Balkan nation’s banking industry by assets, said the bank. Parent banks withdrew 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) from their Serbian units over the past four years while local saving deposits rose by 3 billion euros, Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said today in an e-mailed statement. “The gradual process did not bring into question the stability of the domestic financial sector,” the central bank said, without naming the banks. A report published by international lenders gathered in Brussels this month noted a retreat of Western banks from emerging Europe. “The dominant source of financing of the banking industry is the domestic deposits,” the central bank said. “Serbia is among rare countries in the region that during the crisis had a slowdown, but not a decline, in credit activity.” At the end of September, combined capital of banks exceeded 5 billion euros compared with between 4.1 billion euros and 4.7 billion euros from 2008 to 2010, the bank said. “The decreased exposure of the European banking groups has been accompanied by a positive change in the behavior” of the local units that now rely less on borrowing from their owners and more on international lenders, the central bank said.

U.K. Stocks Are Little Changed Before EU Ministers Meet,['Sarah Jones'],2012-11-12 17:03:22,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/u-k-stocks-climb-as-banks-rebound-before-eu-meeting.html,"U.K. stocks were little changed near a six-week low as investors awaited the outcome of a euro area finance ministers’ meeting in Brussels on releasing more aid for Greece. Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) and Barclays Plc (BARC) led a rebound in banks, both climbing more than 2 percent. Admiral Group Plc and InterContinental (IHG) Hotels Group Plc also advanced as analysts recommended the shares. Anglo American Plc lost 2.1 percent amid continued strikes at its platinum unit in South Africa. The FTSE 100 retreated 2.41 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 5,767.27 at the close of trading in London. The gauge lost 1.7 percent last week amid concern the next slice of aid for Greece from the European Union may be delayed and the U.S. is at risk of slipping back into a recession. The FTSE All- Share Index lost 0.1 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index fell 0.8 percent. “November has seen stock indices fall in what is typically one of the best three months for markets,” Sandy Jadeja, chief technical analyst at City Index , wrote in a report. “There is a potential for a snap back rally if we see Friday’s high for the FTSE 100 (UKX) being cleared and sustained.” The FTSE 100 swung between gains and losses before tonight’s meeting in Brussels where the euro-area’s finance ministers will look at ways to maintain Greek solvency. The volume of shares changing hands on the gauge’s companies was 11 percent lower than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras won the vote on Greece’s 2013 budget early this morning. The nation’s fiscal plan, which forecasts a deficit of 5.2 percent of gross domestic product and a sixth year of contraction, is designed to regain the confidence of its euro-area and International Monetary Fund creditors. Banks Gain A gauge of U.K. banks shares climbed 1 percent, paring some of last week’s 3.7 percent selloff. Lloyds jumped 3.5 percent to 45.14 pence, Barclays increased 2.1 percent to 234.95 pence and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) rose 1.6 percent to 274.5 pence. Admiral Group added 3.6 percent to 1,092 pence after HSBC Holdings Plc today reiterated its overweight recommendation for the shares, meaning investors should own more than are represented in benchmark indexes. “We expect 13 percent pa average earnings growth despite weaker U.K. vehicle growth during next three years,” wrote Dhruv Gahlaut in a note to clients dated today. “Positive commentary on claims from Admiral and other industry participants should support underwriting margins.” InterContinental gained 1.4 percent to 1,579 pence after Exane BNP Paribas raised its recommendation for the world’s largest provider of hotel rooms to outperform, the equivalent of a buy rating, from neutral. Miners Decline Anglo American led mining companies lower, falling 2.1 percent to 1,827.5 pence. Anglo American Platinum Ltd., producer of about 40 percent of the metal, today said the cost of a two- month strike in South Africa has risen to about $263 million as it remains unable to resolve a pay dispute. The Johannesburg-based company known as Amplats, which is about 79 percent-owned by Anglo American, said it’s lost 167,681 ounces of platinum output so far. Xstrata, Glencore Xstrata Plc (XTA) declined 1.5 percent to 956 pence after the Sunday Telegraph reported that some of Xstrata’s investors may vote against the companies’ $80 billion merger with Glencore International Plc (GLEN) , even though Qatar Holding LCC, which owns a 12 percent stake, has backed the deal. The newspaper reported that banks for both companies are trying to convince investors to support the merger and avoid the consequences of a complicated shareholder vote. Glencore’s shares fell 0.9 percent to 336.25 pence.

BG has “quietly” begun to search for a successor, according to the newspaper. G4S Plc (GFS) dropped 1.9 percent to 248.7 pence after Morgan Stanley lowered its recommendation for the security company to equalweight from overweight, meaning investors’ holdings should match what is represented in benchmark indexes.

Novartis Cancer-Drug Patent Denied by India Supreme Court,['Evavon Schaper' 'Pratap Patnaik'],2013-04-01 20:17:15,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/novartis-cancer-drug-patent-denied-by-india-supreme-court.html,"India’s Supreme Court denied Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s request for patent protection for its Gleevec cancer treatment, allowing the nation’s generic-drug makers to continue to sell copies of the drug at a lower price. In a decision watched by non-profit groups seeking to expand access to medicines and drugmakers concerned about India’s position on intellectual property, the court today upheld regulatory rulings dating to 2006 that the drug wasn’t sufficiently innovative to merit a patent. Basel, Switzerland- based Novartis argued that the molecule imatinib , on which Gleevec is based, required years of research and modification to make it an effective, safe leukemia treatment. “Repetitive patent is not permissible on the same drug,” Justices Aftab Alam and Ranjana Prakash Desai said in the court’s ruling in New Delhi. “The drug is neither new nor complies” with provisions of the patent law , they ruled. Novartis India Ltd. (HCBA) shares fell while those of Indian generic copy manufacturer Natco Pharma Ltd. (NTCPH) jumped. The decision may add to concern among Western pharmaceutical companies that India is allowing domestic generic-drug makers to profit from products that deserve patent protection. Scientists credit Gleevec with turning a deadly blood cancer into a chronic disease, and the drug was Novartis’s best-selling product last year with sales of $4.7 billion. Intellectual Property “The worst thing about this is that pharmaceutical companies won’t want to partner with Indian pharma or generic players, because they’ll be significantly concerned about protection of their intellectual property,” said Navid Malik, an analyst with Cenkos Securities Plc (CNKS) in London. “The government is basically trying to create an industry with no investment as generics don’t require much R&D.” The Indian Patent Office in 2006 denied a patent to Novartis, a decision upheld by the Indian Intellectual Property Appellate Board. The board cited a provision of Indian law that aims to prevent “evergreening,” in which companies make an incremental change to a drug’s chemical makeup, without any real medical benefit, to extend its patent life and prevent the introduction of low-cost generic copies. Novartis appealed to the nation’s highest court. Generic versions of the drug are on the market in India. “The Supreme Court ’s decision prevents companies from abusing the patent system to get unwarranted patents on existing medicines,” Leena Menghaney, access campaign manager for Doctors Without Borders, said in an e-mailed statement. Generic Versions Decisions such as today’s may unintentionally stifle India’s drug industry, Ranjit Shahani, vice chairman and managing director at Novartis India, said before the ruling. “We’ll continue to build our business, but we will certainly be cautious in investments in R&D and innovation in India,” Shahani said in an interview. “And until the climate for intellectual property and the ecosystem is fully in place, I don’t think any investment in R&D will take place here.” Brook Baker, a law professor at Northeastern University in Boston , said he doubts the pharmaceutical industry will pull back much on its investments in India based on the decision. The country will still grant 20 year patents on new, innovative drugs and a growing middle class with chronic diseases will provide many business opportunities, he said. “I think there is plenty of incentives for them to come to India,” Baker said in a telephone interview. “They always cry doomsday and say no one will invest in India because it isn’t an investor-friendly country. But companies will invest in India because they can make money there.” Shares Decline Novartis India declined 1.8 percent to 587.95 rupees in Mumbai, the most since March 4. Novartis’s American depositary receipts fell less than 1 percent to $71.06 at the close in New York. Natco Pharma climbed 5.4 percent to 452 rupees in India , its biggest gain since March 5. “This ruling is a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options,” Shahani said in a statement after the decision. “Novartis has never been granted an original patent for Gleevec in India. We strongly believe that original innovation should be recognized in patents to encourage investment in medical innovation especially for unmet medical needs.” Larger Debate Novartis and aid groups agree that the drug itself is of secondary importance in the larger debate over intellectual property. Sales of Gleevec in India are negligible, because more than 90 percent of volume in the country is donated through Novartis programs, available to the poor, Paul Herrling, who heads Novartis’s Institute for Tropical Diseases in Singapore , said in an interview before the decision. Besides denying a patent to Gleevec, India has angered pharmaceutical companies by allowing generic-drug makers to produce copies of patent-protected medicines to ensure they’re available in the country at affordable prices. Drug companies say they have programs in place to make expensive medicines available to the poor. The patent appeals board last month upheld a ruling that allows Natco Pharma to make a low-priced copy of Bayer AG (BAYN) ’s Nexavar cancer treatment. In decisions like the Gleevec ruling, India is weighing the cost of treating patients today against hampering home-grown innovation at a later point, Darius Lakdawalla , a health economist at the University of Southern California , said in an interview. “Today, India is allowing a robust generics industry and not protecting patents and the cost for that is low,” Lakdawalla said. “But what is going to happen five to 10 years in the future?” For Related News and Information: Cancer Drugs for Indian Poor Spark Pfizer Anger at Lost Patents To contact the reporters on this story: Eva von Schaper in Munich at  evonschaper@bloomberg.net ; Pratap Patnaik in New Delhi at  ppatnaik2@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Phil Serafino at  pserafino@bloomberg.net",['Evavon SchaperPratap Patnaik'],"Novartis Cancer-Drug Patent Denied by India Supreme Court India’s Supreme Court denied Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s request for patent protection for its Gleevec cancer treatment, allowing the nation’s generic-drug makers to continue to sell copies of the drug at a lower price.

U.S. Army General Accused of Sexual Misconduct,['Gopal Ratnam'],2012-09-26 23:15:50,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/u-s-army-general-accused-of-sexual-misconduct.html,"U.S. Army Brigadier General Jeffrey Sinclair, an officer with 27 years of military service including tours in Iraq and Afghanistan , was charged today with multiple counts of sexual misconduct and filing of false claims. The charges include forced sex, engaging in “inappropriate relationships” prohibited by regulations, possession of pornographic material and misusing a government charge card, the U.S. Army said in a statement today. Sinclair currently serves as a special assistant to the commanding general of the Army’s XVIII Airborne Corps in Fort Bragg, North Carolina , according to the Army. In his most recent deployment, Sinclair was the deputy commander for support of Regional Command South in Afghanistan from July 2010 to May 2012, according to the Army. Sinclair’s decorations include the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star Medal, according to his Army biography. The U.S. military will conduct an Article 32 inquiry, similar to a grand-jury investigation, to determine the merits of the charges against Sinclar before proceeding to trial, according to the Army. An Army spokesman didn’t immediately reply to an e-mailed request for contact information on Sinclair or his lawyer. The most recent court-martial of a U.S. general officer led to U.S. Army Brigadier General Roger Duff pleading guilty in June to two charges of false official statements and other charges of wearing unauthorized ribbons and badges, according to Army spokesman Colonel Jonathan Withington. Duff was sentenced to two months confinement and dismissal. The case is pending post-trial action and the sentence is not final, Withington said. In March 1999, Army Major General David Hale pled guilty to seven counts of conduct unbecoming an officer and one count relating to a false statement about an adulterous relationship, Withington said in an e-mail. Hale received a reprimand, a fine and demotion to the rank of a brigadier general, Withington said.

Barbour Says Romney Must Focus on Obama Failings (Transcript),[],2012-09-21 19:04:42,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/barbour-says-romney-must-focus-on-obama-failings-transcript-.html,"Former Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that, while Mitt Romney still can defeat Barack Obama , he must shift the focus of the last six weeks of the race to the president’s “policies, the failures of those policies and what Romney would do to get the country back on the right track.” Barbour is helping raise money for American Crossroads, the super-political action committee co-founded by Karl Rove , the former chief political adviser to President George W. Bush. (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.) AL HUNT: We begin the show with the former governor of Mississippi, Haley Barbour. Thank you for joining us today, Haley. HALEY BARBOUR: Al, thanks for having me. HUNT: Mitt Romney has had a rough couple weeks since Labor Day. What does the Republican nominee need to do to get his campaign back on track? BARBOUR: As long as the campaign coverage is about process, about polling, any time it’s not about jobs and the economy, and about serious policy and the results of policy, that’s bad for Romney. So he’s got to get the campaign back on the real issues that Americans talk about at the dinner table, jobs, the economy. HUNT: Why hasn’t he done that? That hasn’t been the message he’s conveyed. BARBOUR: I can’t - I can’t answer that question. But the good news for Republicans is, having not done that for a month, the Gallup poll yesterday was a tie. Rasmussen’s poll, which was the closest to the actual outcome in 2008, is within the margin of error. So, you know, everybody criticizes Romney’s campaign for this, that and the other - and I’m not an apologist for him - but he’s even. He’s still at a place to win this election. And I think it’s his to win. But to do it, it has to be an election about Obama’s policies, the failures of those policies, and what Romney would do to get the country back on the right track. HUNT: Is his famous or infamous 47 percent remark at a private fundraiser - should he - would he have been better off by simply apologizing, as Obama did with his indiscreet remark four years ago about guns and religion? Should Mitt Romney have just said, hey, you know, I made a boo-boo? BARBOUR: Of course, I don’t know what the question was. Obviously, in this - this thing that was videotaped surreptitiously, he was answering a question. I don’t know what the question was. But it is not correct that 47 percent of Americans are on means-tested entitlements, on welfare. Many, many of those people are retired military. They’re Social Security - (CROSSTALK) BARBOUR: - and whose votes he’s going to get. HUNT: That’s why I say, should he - should he have just simply apologized in the beginning, said, hey, you know, people make - make silly remarks sometimes, we all do it? BARBOUR: Well, or - you know, perhaps a better way to say it is, you know, I made a mistake on that - on that number. HUNT: Right. BARBOUR: But, again, as long as this is about process and as long as this is - we’re talking about this and we’re not talking about why the Federal Reserve Board thought they had to take unprecedented action to create jobs, because the Obama administration’s policies are not creating the jobs. HUNT: But, Haley, we’re now talking another week, there’s going to be a reset. The candidate’s going to get to those issues you’re talking about. Why didn’t that happen in Tampa? BARBOUR: Well, you know, again, I’m not trying to be here to be an apologist. The main thing for me is, even though it’s Sept. 21, on Sept. 20, the race was a tie. And so Romney is blessed that, while he hasn’t done the things that I would have recommended, and while the coverage hasn’t been what I would have wanted, he’s still in an even race. And now he’s got to make this an election about what Obama’s policies have been, how and why they’ve failed, and then what he would do differently and why that would - (CROSSTALK) HUNT: Let me ask you a final - a final Romney question. Let’s ignore the horse-race questions for a second. With six- and-a-half weeks left, though, he’s still viewed negatively. Take the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll, Bill McInturff and Peter Hart, other than Bloomberg, the best poll that there is. They have Obama up 11 points on economic vision. But looking out for the middle class, Obama 53, Romney 34. The middle class determines elections. BARBOUR: Well, of course they do, because most of the people in America are middle class. Well, look, Romney came out of the primary with the nomination in an even race. Obama’s strategy was the 1996 strategy that the Democrats had of making Dole unacceptable. And so they spent $150 million more or less telling people that Romney was a vulture capitalist, that he was - didn’t care about people like them, that he was some kind of plutocrat married to a known equestrian. HUNT: And it worked. BARBOUR: Well, it - well, of course it’s worked some, because it was generally unanswered. HUNT: Right. BARBOUR: Yet, when it went to the convention, it was a tie. Ryan pulled them back up. We got our convention boost two weeks before the convention, and it was a tie. Now we come out of the Democrat convention, Obama got a nice boost - HUNT: And you didn’t get much of a boost out of Tampa. BARBOUR: Well, we really got ours before Tampa. HUNT: OK, I see. BARBOUR: You look at how - how Romney went up in the polls 3 or 4 points. HUNT: Right. BARBOUR: Now we’re back to where it’s a tie. And so I think that’s the real state of play, why? Not because people love Mitt Romney. They don’t know very much good about Mitt Romney. But they know Obama’s policies don’t deserve to be re-elected. HUNT: Let’s turn to the race for the Congress. I think almost everyone agrees the Republicans will hold the House. A couple months ago, there was a lot of optimism about the Senate. Now, when you look at polls - and I don’t know how reliable any of these polls are, but I look at them from Maine to Massachusetts , North Dakota , Virginia , they all seem to be tilting Democratic. Why? BARBOUR: Well, I think, first of all, it’s always going to have been a really tight race. Somebody’s going to end up with 50, 51, 52 in the Senate. We were never shooting fish in a barrel. But the Democrats have some - some of their best - you look at Tim Kaine here, who’s been governor of Virginia, I think far more liberal than Virginia, very tied to Obama, but he’s an attractive, good candidate. He’s been governor here, just like Mark - HUNT: Warner. BARBOUR: Yeah, Mark Warner has been governor here. They got the best candidate they could have in North Dakota. And I think we’ll win North Dakota. I think we’ll win Montana. I think we’ll win Virginia. HUNT: But they’re tough. They’re all tough races. BARBOUR: But the fact - they’re all really tough races, because they got good candidates, and we kicked away a race in - in Missouri. HUNT: Well, I was going to talk to you about that, because Todd Akin this week, as you know, said that - he said you’re the godfather of D.C. party bosses and you’re trying to avenge your personal brand in getting him out. BARBOUR: Well, maybe I’m the godfather of Yazoo City party bosses. But, look, here’s my complaint about Todd Akin, who I couldn’t pick out of a line-up with the Spice Girls. Here’s a guy that Harry Reid and Claire McCaskill , the Democrat senator, put nearly $2 million into Todd Akin’s effort to win the Republican nomination. I am not interested in electing Harry Reid’s favorite Republican to the United States Senate. HUNT: You don’t think he’s going to drop out now, though, do you? BARBOUR: Apparently not. He says he isn’t. I take him at his word. But, look, that’s - I say stupid stuff sometimes. I’m not so balled up here on stupid stuff. I just don’t want us having Harry Reid’s favorite Republican running against Claire McCaskill, to which they were so dedicated they put more than $1 million, almost $2 million behind Akin to win the Republican primary. HUNT: Will money make a difference overall nationally on either the presidential or the congressional election? BARBOUR: You know, my view has always been, you’ve got to have enough money. Necessarily spending the most money is not the point. But you’ve got to have - HUNT: Both sides will have enough? BARBOUR: Both of them will have plenty of money. HUNT: Haley Barbour, you are the godfather of Republican politics, and that is a compliment.

Bush. (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.) AL HUNT: We begin the show with the former governor of Mississippi, Haley Barbour. Thank you for joining us today, Haley. HALEY BARBOUR: Al, thanks for having me. HUNT: Mitt Romney has had a rough couple weeks since Labor Day. What does the Republican nominee need to do to get his campaign back on track? BARBOUR: As long as the campaign coverage is about process, about polling, any time it’s not about jobs and the economy, and about serious policy and the results of policy, that’s bad for Romney. So he’s got to get the campaign back on the real issues that Americans talk about at the dinner table, jobs, the economy. HUNT: Why hasn’t he done that? That hasn’t been the message he’s conveyed. BARBOUR: I can’t - I can’t answer that question. But the good news for Republicans is, having not done that for a month, the Gallup poll yesterday was a tie. Rasmussen’s poll, which was the closest to the actual outcome in 2008, is within the margin of error.

Canada June Consumer Price Index Report (Text),['Ilan Kolet'],2013-07-19 12:30:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/canada-june-consumer-price-index-report-text-.html,"The following is the text of Canada ’s consumer price index report for June released by Statistics Canada. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 1.2% in the 12 months to June, following a 0.7% increase in May. This 0.5 percentage point gain in the CPI was led by transportation prices, which rose 2.0% on a year-over-year basis in June after falling 0.5% in May. The acceleration in the transportation index was mostly attributable to prices for gasoline and for the purchase of passenger vehicles, both of which rose in the 12 months to June after declining in May. Compared with June last year, gasoline prices were up 4.6%. This followed a 1.5% decrease in May. Gasoline prices increased in the 12 months to June in all provinces, with Manitoba and Alberta posting the largest gains. Prices for the purchase of passenger vehicles rose 2.0% in the 12 months to June, after declining 0.5% in May. The year-over-year increase in June was mainly attributable to smaller monthly price declines in June 2013 compared with the same month last year. 12-month change in the major components Consumer prices rose in six of the eight major components in the 12 months to June. The exceptions were health and personal care as well as recreation, education and reading. In addition to transportation, the shelter and food components led the increase in the CPI in June. Shelter costs rose 1.2% in the 12 months to June, after increasing 1.3% in May. Natural gas prices and rent increased on a year-over-year basis in June, while mortgage interest cost decreased 3.8%. Food prices increased 1.2% year over year in June, following a 1.3% rise in May. Compared with June 2012, consumers paid 1.3% more for food purchased from stores, as prices rose for fresh vegetables (+5.1%) and meat (+2.2%). In contrast, prices for sugar and confectionery declined 4.3%. Consumers also paid 1.1% more for food purchased from restaurants. 12-month change in the provinces Consumer prices rose in nine provinces in the 12 months to June, with the largest increase occurring in Manitoba. The exception was British Columbia, where prices declined on a year-over-year basis. In Manitoba, consumer prices increased 2.7% year over year in June, following a 1.8% gain in May. Gasoline prices rose 10.7% in the 12 months to June, after advancing 0.9% in May. Among the provinces, Manitoba posted the largest year-over-year price increase for cigarettes and for passenger vehicle registration fees. Alberta’s CPI rose 2.3% on a year-over-year basis in June, matching the increase in May. Gasoline prices advanced at a faster rate in the 12 months to June (+9.2%) compared with May (+1.6%). Conversely, smaller year-over-year price increases were observed for natural gas in June relative to May. Prices in British Columbia fell 0.5% in the 12 months to June, after declining 0.6% in May. The province posted year-over-year price decreases for food purchased from restaurants and homeowners’ replacement cost, while at the national level these indexes increased. Additionally, gasoline prices rose 3.2% year over year in June, after increasing 1.4% in May, a smaller acceleration than at the national level. Seasonally adjusted monthly Consumer Price Index increases On a seasonally adjusted ( http://www23.statcan.gc.ca:81/imdb/p2SV_e.pl?Function=getSurvey &amp;SDDS=2301&amp;lang=en&amp;db=imdb&amp;adm=8&amp;dis=2#b10) monthly basis, the CPI increased 0.3% in June, after rising 0.2% in May. The seasonally adjusted indexes for six of the eight major components increased in June. The two exceptions were alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, which declined 0.1%, and clothing and footwear, which posted no change.

Ninety policemen have been killed since the beginning of the year. The crime spree represents a setback after a decade of security improvements that saw Sao Paulo’s homicide rate fall more than 78 percent, converting the city into one of Brazil’s safest. At the heart of the recent wave of violence is a coordinated campaign against the city’s newly-elected mayor by the First Command of the Capital, or PCC, the gang that dominates the city’s drug trade and prisons, crime experts said. “The PCC is sending a political message to the new government: back off or we’ll kill more policemen,” Julio Jacobo Waiselfisz, author of an annual publication on violence in Brazil and a researcher for the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences, said by telephone from Recife. “There’s an open war between this group and the state. The population is frightened.” Federal Aid President Dilma Rousseff ’s administration last week pledged additional federal aid, including increased intelligence and drug-combating operations, as well as heightened police controls at access points to Sao Paulo, as schools and stores were forced to close in some of the city’s northern neighborhoods because of violence. Fernando Haddad, a candidate for Rousseff’s ruling Workers’ Party, was elected mayor of Sao Paulo on Oct. 28. The PCC in 2006 spearheaded a wave of attacks on police stations and buses in Sao Paulo, paralyzing parts of the city that has a gross domestic product roughly the size of Chile ’s. The homicide rate in Sao Paulo state fell to 10.1 per 100,000 inhabitants last year from 35.3 per 100,000 in 1999, according to the website of the state’s public security secretary. In the state of Rio de Janeiro , where authorities have won praise for efforts to pacify shantytowns once controlled by drug gangs, the rate was 24.9 per 100,000. This year through September, murders in Sao Paulo have risen to 3,536 from 3,225, whereas in killings in Rio have fallen to 3,028 from 3,227. Crime has fallen in Brazil in tandem with economic growth that averaged 3.8 percent a year over the past decade and expanded social welfare policies that helped pull nearly 40 million people out of poverty. Still, the country remains one of the world’s most-violent, with an average homicide rate over the past decade has remained little changed at 26 per 100,000 inhabitants, Waiselfiz said.

Target Third-Quarter Profit Rises 15% as Store Sales Gain,['Matt Townsend'],2012-11-15 14:58:53,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/target-third-quarter-profit-rises-15-as-store-sales-gain.html,"Target Corp. (TGT) , the second-largest U.S. discount retailer, said third-quarter profit increased 15 percent as its branded credit cards boosted store sales. Net income in the quarter ended Oct. 27 rose to $637 million, or 96 cents a share, from $555 million, or 82 cents, a year earlier, the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. Analysts projected 96 cents, the average of six estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel has spent the past two years squeezing more sales from Target’s 1,700 U.S. stores by adding fresh food and exclusive merchandise. The chain also has encouraged more spending from its best customers by giving 5 percent discounts on purchases made with a Target-branded credit or debit card. “Target’s fundamentals remain solid,” Charles Grom , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, wrote in a note to clients before the results. The company has shown increases in store traffic with growing penetration of fresh food and loyalty card users, said Grom, who recommends buying the shares. Those initiatives have helped maintain sales growth as the company slowed store openings in preparation for its first expansion outside the U.S. next year to Canada. Revenue from established stores increased 3.7 percent this year through October, the company said Nov. 1. Target posted a gain of 3 percent for all of last year. Target rose 0.8 percent to $61.85 at 9:57 a.m. in New York. The shares had gained 20 percent this year through yesterday. Gross Margin Narrows The third-quarter results included a one-time gain of 15 cents a share from an agreement last month to sell its credit card portfolio to TD Bank Group. While increasing sales of food and having more shoppers use its discount cards has boosted Target’s revenue, those strategies have also hurt profitability. Gross margin, the percentage of sales left after subtracting the cost of goods sold, weakened in the third quarter, narrowing to 30.3 percent form 30.5 percent a year earlier. The percentage of sales being made through its REDCard discount program, which includes Target-issued credit and debit cards, rose to 14 percent from 9.5 percent a year earlier. Comparable-store sales rose 2.9 percent in the quarter. Total sales , including revenue from the credit-card unit, rose 3.2 percent to $16.93 billion. Analysts projected $16.95 billion, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Profit in the fourth quarter will be $1.45 to $1.55 a share, the company said.

People don’t realize that the system has actually collapsed.” The MSCI World (MXWO) Index has plunged 15 percent since July on concerns that the default of a European nation could lead to a contagion that spreads to banks throughout the region and in the U.S. Soros, whose $25 billion Quantum hedge fund gained about 20 percent a year on average since 1969, said he’s not certain how to fix Europe ’s debt problems or how to navigate financial markets. “That is not so easy,” he said in the interview in London. “There is a lot of confusion, and I am also confused.” Soros, who was born in Hungary , promoted opposition to Russia ’s communist regime before it collapsed in 1991. In 1993, he founded the Open Society Institute to help formerly communist countries make the transition to democracy. The biggest mistake governments made in responding to 2008 credit freeze was failing to approve rules that would regulate banks and other financial firms across the globe, Soros said. While markets have become integrated, individual nations continue to set their own rules, which has allowed “deregulation to spread like a virus,” he said. Returning Investors’ Money “Regulation is very difficult and we haven’t solved it at all,” he said. “We are very early in the process and we are not making much progress.” Soros’s hedge fund decided in July to return money to outside investors, meaning it will only manage assets for him and his family. The move will end an investing career that spanned more than four decades and gained Soros international acclaim in 1992 after he made $1 billion betting that the Bank of England would be forced to devalue the pound. Soros, in the interview, said he now spends all his time on philanthropy, describing it as a “full-time job.” To contact the reporter on this story: Jesse Westbrook in 東京 at  jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Edward Evans at  eevans3@bloomberg.net",['Jesse Westbrook'],"Soros Says Europe, U.S. Turmoil Reminds Him of Soviet Collapse Billionaire investor George Soros said the disruption to global financial markets since 2008 has implications for Europe and the U.S. that remind him of the final years of the Soviet Union. “Something similar is happening in the West,” Soros, 81, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Eye to Eye with Francine Lacqua,” airing today. “You had a financial crisis where the market did actually collapse, but it was kept alive by the authorities.

Poloz Counsels Patience as Canada Waits for Investment,['Greg Quinn'],2013-07-19 20:36:43,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/poloz-counsels-patience-as-canada-waits-for-investment.html,"Stephen Poloz, the new Bank of Canada governor, has a message for debt-laden Canadians awaiting exports and business spending to lead economic growth: be patient, and keep spending less. Canadian companies are increasing their investment plans at the slowest pace in three years, while the household debt-to-income ratio is close to a record high. Poloz, who forecast this week that business outlays will triple their contribution to economic growth in 2014, said there’s little he can do to speed up a needed rotation of demand from consumers to businesses. “This is the natural course of events,” Poloz, 57, told reporters in Ottawa on July 17 after his inaugural interest-rate announcement. “What we require now is a little bit of patience as opposed to somehow trying to force something to happen.” Poloz left his benchmark rate at 1 percent, the highest among Group of Seven central banks, marking the 23rd consecutive meeting with no change. In continuing the longest interest-rate pause since the 1950s, Canada stands in contrast with peers such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan , which are continuing or expanding extraordinary measures aimed at spurring domestic demand. China also took steps to bolster its economy, removing the floor on lending rates offered by the nation’s financial institutions as economic growth slows, the People’s Bank of China said in a statement on its website. Spending Trigger More orders from the U.S., Europe and Japan are needed to boost exports and trigger the spending that will lead to a stronger Canadian expansion, Poloz said. The weakness of domestic demand was underscored by a report today showing that inflation fell short of the central bank’s 2 percent target for a 14th straight month. Retail and factory sales have been little changed for a year, Statistics Canada data show. “There is no pent-up demand in the domestic economy,” said Jeff Herold, who helps oversee C$2.5 billion ($2.4 billion) as lead fixed-income manager at J. Zechner Associates Inc. in Toronto. “We need to see some external drivers, either some business investment or business growth, so we are somewhat dependent on U.S. and global growth to see a better economy in Canada.” The International Monetary Fund says the country’s 1.7 percent growth this year will be among the slowest in the Group of 20 nations outside of Europe. Canada’s dollar has weakened by 0.9 percent over the last month on signs that the U.S. economy is growing faster. Canada’s benchmark stock index is underperforming U.S. equities for a third year after seven years of stronger gains, while government bond yields have also risen less than Treasuries, suggesting investors are expecting less of a rebound in growth in Canada. Canadian Dollar The Canadian dollar was little changed following today’s inflation report, trading at 1.0366 per U.S. dollar at 4:33 p.m. in Toronto, up 0.1 percent from late yesterday. Canadian stocks rose, with the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index gaining 56.28 points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,685.13. Consumer spending spurred by cheap borrowing costs pulled Canada out of the most recent recession faster than other Group of Seven nations, leading to a record household debt-to-income ratio. “Don’t expect Canada to be outperforming its peers now because those sectors that pushed Canada above the rest, those are fading now,” said Krishen Rangasamy , senior economist at National Bank Financial in Montreal. “It’s a good thing because we need to get to a point where housing and credit accumulation slow to a more sustainable path.” Growth Model Poloz has said that the model of growth led by debt-fueled consumption is reaching its limits. Canada’s debt-to-income ratio was 161.8 percent in the first quarter, down from an all-time high of 162.8 in last year’s third quarter. “The household sector has done a lot of heavy lifting through this cycle,” Poloz said. “Those levels of debt are large and so it’s comforting to us to see them drifting down.” Finance Minister Jim Flaherty has echoed the central bank’s warnings about debt. Flaherty tightened mortgage rules for a fourth time last year and has warned about the risks of overbuilding in Toronto and Vancouver, the country’s largest and third-biggest cities. While consumers responded to low interest rates , Canadian businesses have yet to follow suit. Oil and gas companies, which account for almost half of all business investment by firms listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, are planning C$18.2 billion in spending this quarter, down 1.5 percent from a year earlier. Investment Plans The Bank of Canada’s latest survey of corporate executives, published last week, showed machinery and equipment purchase plans at the second lowest level since 2009 as the last recession ended. Canadian firms had a record C$544 billion in cash on their balance sheets in the first quarter, suggesting ample capacity to invest. While Poloz’s predecessor, Mark Carney , said that they should either spend this “dead money” or return it to shareholders, Poloz -- who worked closely with companies during a 14-year career at the country’s export financing agency --says firms are acting with understandable caution. “If you were making those decisions you’d want to be more sure too, because this is real money that’s going on the line,” Poloz said this week. Russ Girling , chief executive officer of TransCanada Corp. (TRP) , the Calgary-based firm that’s proposed building the Keystone XL pipeline, shares this caution. ‘Fragile’ Economy The Canadian economy “continues to be fragile and it’s somewhat dependent on what happens globally,” Girling said in a July 18 interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York. The central bank forecast the contribution to economic growth from investment will triple to 0.6 percentage point next year and then rise to 0.9 percentage point in 2015. “I’m highly skeptical, and I have been all along, that business investment can lead growth,” said Doug Porter , chief economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. “Investment is a very late-cycle mover.” Flaherty’s plan to eliminate a budget deficit by the next election in 2015 also rules out much of a boost from government spending , Porter said. In the absence of rapid growth in exports and investment, Canada’s key interest rate will probably stay at 1 percent until the fourth quarter of next year, according to a Bloomberg survey. “Is there something else that we can do at this stage?” Poloz said at a June 19 event hosted by the Oakville, Ontario, Chamber of Commerce. “We would say ‘Well, no.’” To contact the reporter on this story: Greg Quinn in Ottawa at  gquinn1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chris Wellisz at  cwellisz@bloomberg.net",['Greg Quinn'],"Poloz Counsels Patience as Canada Waits for Investment Stephen Poloz, the new Bank of Canada governor, has a message for debt-laden Canadians awaiting exports and business spending to lead economic growth: be patient, and keep spending less.

Diabetes Drugs’ Pancreas Risk Not Backed by Evidence: EMA,['Andrea Gerlin'],2013-07-26 10:51:06,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/diabetes-drugs-pancreas-risk-not-backed-by-evidence-ema.html,"A European Medicines Agency committee didn’t find enough evidence to support scientists’ concerns that a class of diabetes drugs known as GLP-1s affect pancreatic cell growth, the regulator said today. “Available data do not confirm recent concerns over an increased risk of pancreatic adverse events with these medicines,” the London-based agency said in a statement. The EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, had started its review of the therapies in March.

Netanyahu to Meet Party Leaders in Effort to Seal New Government,['Calev Ben-David'],2013-03-11 08:57:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/netanyahu-to-meet-party-leaders-in-effort-to-seal-new-government.html,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet with three prospective coalition partners in Jerusalem today in a bid to reach a final agreement to form a new government. Netanyahu has until March 16 under Israeli electoral law to put together a ruling coalition following January elections. U.S. President Barack Obama is due to arrive for a three-day visit beginning March 20. The three party leaders - Yisrael Beitenu’s Avigdor Liberman, Yesh Atid’s Yair Lapid and Jewish Home’s Naftali Bennett - will meet with Netanyahu in his office at noon, Noga Rappaport, spokeswoman for the prime minister’s Likud party, said in a phone interview. “They will try to resolve all remaining issues and reach final coalition agreements,” Rappaport said. Netanyahu is trying to put together a coalition that will hold a majority in Israel ’s 120-seat parliament, the Knesset. His Likud party, which ran on a joint ticket with Yisrael Beitenu in Jan. 22 elections, won the most seats, 31. Netanyahu has also signed a coalition agreement with the six-seat Hatenuah faction, whose leader, former foreign minister Tzipi Livni , will be appointed justice minister. A deal with Yesh Atid, which holds 19 seats, and Jewish Home, which won 12, would give him a parliamentary majority. Military Draft Outstanding issues include the distribution of Cabinet portfolios, the total number of ministers, and details over an agreement to limit draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox Jews, Israel Radio said today. Israel’s TA-25 benchmark index rallied to the highest in almost three weeks on news of an impending coalition deal, closing up 0.9 percent yesterday at 1,237.28. “The market is optimistic following nearly two months of uncertainty since the elections about what form the government would take,” Zach Herzog, head of international sales at Psagot Investment House Ltd. in Tel Aviv , said by phone yesterday. One stumbling block to forming a coalition was overcome at the weekend when Lapid agreed to become the next finance minister after aiming for the post of foreign minister. Netanyahu has said he is holding the foreign ministry post forLiberman, pending the outcome of legal proceedings against him. Liberman’s Future Liberman, who resigned as foreign minister in December after being indicted on fraud and breach of trust charges, remains in parliament and has been involved in the coalition talks. Final coalition agreements will probably be reached by Tuesday or Wednesday, he told Army Radio yesterday. Jewish Home’s Bennett will be appointed minister of industry, trade and labor, Haaretz said yesterday, citing unidentified party officials. Yesh Atid, which campaigned primarily as a champion of middle-class concerns, favors advancing peace talks with the Palestinians toward a two-state solution. Jewish Home opposes any Palestinian state and supports increasing West Bank settlements. Sitting in opposition to the government will be two ultra- Orthodox parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism, which would not agree to demands to limit draft exemptions for young men studying in religious seminaries. It will be the first time in a decade that the ultra-Orthodox parties are not included in the coalition.

Emerging Stocks Decline as U.S. to China Data Disappoint,['Harry Suhartono' 'Ksenia Galouchko'],2013-04-01 21:14:42,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/emerging-stocks-snap-five-day-gain-after-south-korea-china-data.html,"Emerging stocks fell for the first time in six days, led by commodity producers, as data from the U.S. to China and Japan came in below economists’ estimates. Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea ’s biggest automaker, retreated the most in more than a week in Seoul , while the won slid versus the dollar as worsening relations with North Korea heightened the risk of conflict. Sterlite Industries ( India ) Ltd., the nation’s biggest copper producer, tumbled 4.5 percent after it was ordered to close a smelter. Brazil ’s Bovespa index fell as PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos & Participacoes slumped. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slid 0.4 percent to 1,031.15, after rallying 1.9 percent last week. Stocks fell as data showed manufacturing in the U.S. expanded less than forecast in March, while the Bank of Japan ’s Tankan index of confidence among large manufacturers improved less than estimated. South Korean exports grew less than economists anticipated and a pickup in China’s output trailed projections. “Global economic reports are reflecting the fact that the glass is not half empty, not half full,” Bruce McCain, who helps oversee more than $20 billion as chief investment strategist at the private-banking unit of KeyCorp in Cleveland , said in a phone interview. “There’s no area in the world that is able to achieve the breakout that could drive enthusiasm in the market right now.” Eight out of 10 groups in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index retreated today. The broader gauge has slipped 2.3 percent this year, trailing a 6.7 percent gain in the MSCI World Index of developed-country stocks. The emerging-markets measure trades at 10.8 times 12-month projected profit, compared with the MSCI World’s 14.2 valuation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Emerging ETF The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets exchange-traded fund, the ETF tracking developing-nation shares, fell 1.1 percent to $42.31, after rallying 1.9 percent last week. The Chicago Board Options Exchange prices on the fund and expectations of price swings, advanced 8.7 percent to 18.18. The Bovespa fell for the first time in four trading days as economists covering Brazil raised their 2014 inflation forecasts. Homebuilder PDG Realty, dropped 1.9 percent, leading consumer stocks lower. Brazilian equities are handing investors the worst returns in Latin America as companies post the longest streak of earnings misses in six years. Forty-two (IBOV) of the Bovespa index’s 64 members trailed analysts’ earnings estimates in the fourth quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the fifth straight period that more than 50 percent the companies included in the benchmark fell short of projections, the longest string of disappointments since 2007. Russian Shares Russian shares fell for the first time in four days as crude sank, dulling the appeal of equities in the world’s largest energy exporter. OAO Rosneft and OAO Lukoil, Russia ’s largest oil producers with a combined 20 percent weighting in the Micex, fell 0.9 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively. Hong Kong , Australia , New Zealand and most markets in Europe are closed for public holidays today. South Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 0.4 percent, the first decline in the measure in six days. Hyundai Motor lost 0.9 percent, the most since March 21, while Samsung Electronics Co., the biggest stock on the MSCI emerging-markets index (MXEF) , dropped 1 percent. The won weakened 0.3 percent to a one-week low. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called nuclear weapons development one of the nation’s top priorities yesterday, escalating tensions with the South that were reignited after North Korea detonated a nuclear device in February. Indian equities climbed, rebounding from the first quarterly drop since 2011. Industrial stocks led the gain. Sterlite Industries tumbled to its lowest close since June 4. Most Chinese stocks rose as gains by property developers and health-care companies offset economic data that missed estimates. The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.1 percent.

"Washington Wines Pack High Alcohol Wallop, Little Else",['John Mariani'],2013-04-01 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/washington-wines-pack-high-alcohol-wallop-little-else.html,"On a recent trip to Seattle I had the chance to revisit the wines of Washington state, the nation’s second largest premium wine producer after California. I’ve always had high regard for a few estates like the pioneering Chateau Ste. Michelle and Columbia Crest. Washington has had wine grape plantings since 1825, and today the state has 750 wineries and 13 approved appellations selling $3 billion a year. Yet, it only became a modern viticultural region during the 1970s, when strides were made in producing consistently good vinifera like chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon and merlot in the Yakima and Columbia River valleys. Since then, there has been a good deal of experimentation with other varietals like riesling, semillon and syrah, and some of the state’s very best wines are late harvest dessert wines. Rieslings in particular have compared variably with those in Alsace and New York state for their balance of fruit and acidity. Washington has always prided itself on intense, highly tannic, high-alcohol wines that show well in their youth but often lose brightness and complexity with age. This, I’m sorry to say, was even more prevalent among the wines I sampled then I can recall from previous tastings. One Dimensional The most salient example was a Woodward Canyon Old Vines Dedication Series #28 Cabernet Sauvignon 2008 ($75) from Walla Walla. With a whopping 16.5 percent alcohol, it was all full-tilt tannin and new oak, and after just half a glass, I found nothing distinctive about it except for its one-dimensional character. After five years this monster should have loosened up but hasn’t. The same winery’s Artist Series #18 ($45) was only 15.8 percent alcohol, but still felt like a blow to the palate rather than a pleasurable wine, despite a Bordeaux-like blend of cabernet franc, merlot, petit verdot and syrah in with the cabernet sauvignon. Columbia Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 2003, is a much-ballyhooed cult favorite that sells in stores for between $300 and $400. At 14.9 percent alcohol and a decade old it was a blockbuster, but once it exploded in the mouth, there was no finish of any kind. Veal Chop I found relief from the brash alcohol levels with a well-fruited Seven Hills Merlot 2007 ($22) whose softness was due to the varietal, while an inexpensive cabernet sauvignon from Chaz Point 2010 ($18) showed round levels of fruit and a pleasing lushness that went very well with a veal chop over dinner. There was also a good mix of strawberry-like fruit and cherry flavors in JM Cellars Tre Fanciulli 2007 ($35). It’s a judicious blend of 67 percent cabernet sauvignon, 19 percent merlot and 14 percent syrah which boosted the elegance of the wine. At only 14.4 percent alcohol, it shows how the terroir of the Columbia Valley, whose south-facing slopes get a great deal of solar radiation, can produce power within a velvet glove. Among the rieslings I drank in Seattle , I very much enjoyed a citrus-bright Efeste Evergreen Vineyard 2011 ($17) that was an ideal match with cold shellfish. Boom Boom Washington vintners have a knack for quirky names for their wines, like Boom Boom, Livewire and Jigsaw. Kung Fu Girl, a riesling by Charles Smith, is a crowd pleaser at about $10; it makes no pretensions other than to show off good apple, melon flavors and a little sweetness that makes it a fine aperitif. Smith says that he “focuses on the way people generally consume wine today: immediately. The intent was (and still is) to create wines to be enjoyed now, but with true ’typicity’ of both the varietal and the vineyard.” His motto? “It’s just wine, drink it.” Wine is a lot more, certainly, but Washington vintners should step away from thinking that a bigger wine is a better wine.

(CHK) demoted the lead counsel who defended Chief Executive Officer Aubrey McClendon’s use of private stakes in company-operated natural- gas wells to obtain more than $800 million in personal loans. In the first executive reshuffling since Chesapeake stripped McClendon of the chairman’s role and replaced more than half its directors in June, General Counsel Henry J. Hood was replaced as head of Chesapeake’s legal department by James R. Webb, the Oklahoma City-based company said in a statement today. Webb, a partner at the McAfee & Taft law firm, has been working for Chesapeake on a contract basis as chief legal counsel for the past four months, according to the statement. Hood will retain oversight of the company’s land and regulatory departments, Chesapeake said. “This does seem like a demotion for Henry Hood,” Philip Weiss , an analyst at Argus Research Corp. in New York , said in an e-mailed statement today. “Based on what we see here, he’s seen his responsibilities scaled back.” Hood issued a statement on April 18 that said Chesapeake directors were “fully aware” of the existence of the personal loans McClendon obtained to finance his share of expenses for private stakes in thousands of company wells. On April 26, Chesapeake backtracked, saying in a statement that although the board was “generally aware” of the CEO’s loans, it hadn’t vetted the arrangements. The directors announced an internal review of McClendon’s personal transactions the same day.

New Syrian Opposition Group Gets Backing From Arab League,['Donna Abu-Nasr' 'Salma El Wardany'],2012-11-12 23:28:46,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/new-syrian-opposition-group-gets-backing-from-arab-league.html,"Syria ’s new opposition coalition plans to form a transitional government after it gains international recognition, said Abdelbaset Sieda, a member of the group. The Syrian National Coalition for Opposition and Revolutionary Forces, set up Nov. 11 after more than a week of meetings in the Qatari capital Doha, will boost international support for the opposition by showing unity, Sieda said in a phone interview yesterday. The Arab League, meeting in Cairo, agreed yesterday to a resolution recognizing the new group as representing the “aspirations of the Syrian people.” It called on nations and others to support the rebel coalition “politically and materially.” The Arab League action followed by hours a similar announcement by the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi Arabia. The council recognized the opposition body and offered support “to meet the demands and the hopes of the Syrian people,” the Saudi Press Agency reported, citing a statement by the council’s secretary general, Abullatif Al Zayani. The Syrian umbrella group will include political opponents of President Bashar al-Assad, with leaders of the rebel fighters to make up a separate military council that will be formed by the government. It’s an effort to unite the anti-Assad forces, which have remained divided even as the violence intensifies and Arab and Western countries urge unity. Deaths in Uprising More than 35,000 people have died since the uprising began in March 2011, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Syrian troops loyal to Assad killed 128 people across the country yesterday, including 49 in or around the capital Damascus, the opposition Local Coordination Committees said in an e-mailed statement. The National Coalition chose as its head Mouaz al-Khatib, a Muslim cleric who has been calling for a united front among Syria’s sectarian and ethnic groups since the start of the uprising. “There will be a transitional government,” said Sieda, who until last week had headed the Syrian National Council, an earlier effort to unify the opposition. He said that there is “no alternative” other than to base the new government within Syrian territory, where it will need “protection in addition to financial resources so that it can perform its duties.” The formation of the coalition is only a “first step” and its members have “got to show that they can work effectively to have some impact on the ground,” said Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Institution’s Doha Center in Qatar. Umbrella Group The U.S. government welcomed the formation of the new umbrella group, which it had worked behind the scenes to encourage after backing away from the Syrian National Council. The U.S. had criticized the exile-run council for political infighting, ineffectiveness and for failing to unite with groups doing the fighting in Syria. The Obama administration sent several senior diplomats, including Ambassador to Syria Stephen Ford, to participate in Doha on the fringes of the organizational talks. “We look forward to supporting the National Coalition as it charts a course toward the end of Assad’s bloody rule and the start of the peaceful, just, democratic future that all the people of Syria deserve,” Mark Toner, deputy spokesman for the State Department, said in an e-mailed statement that pledged humanitarian and non-lethal assistance.

He said that there is “no alternative” other than to base the new government within Syrian territory, where it will need “protection in addition to financial resources so that it can perform its duties.” The formation of the coalition is only a “first step” and its members have “got to show that they can work effectively to have some impact on the ground,” said Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Institution’s Doha Center in Qatar. Umbrella Group The U.S. government welcomed the formation of the new umbrella group, which it had worked behind the scenes to encourage after backing away from the Syrian National Council. The U.S. had criticized the exile-run council for political infighting, ineffectiveness and for failing to unite with groups doing the fighting in Syria. The Obama administration sent several senior diplomats, including Ambassador to Syria Stephen Ford, to participate in Doha on the fringes of the organizational talks. “We look forward to supporting the National Coalition as it charts a course toward the end of Assad’s bloody rule and the start of the peaceful, just, democratic future that all the people of Syria deserve,” Mark Toner, deputy spokesman for the State Department, said in an e-mailed statement that pledged humanitarian and non-lethal assistance.

"Hungary Should Pause Rate Cuts, IMF Says",['Edith Balazs'],2013-03-29 14:00:02,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-29/hungary-should-pause-rate-cuts-imf-says.html,"Hungary should pause with monetary easing after the benchmark interest rate dropped to a record low in a series of “appropriate” cuts, the International Monetary Fund said. A further “deep” reduction of borrowing costs raises the risk of weakening the forint and undermining financial stability, the Washington-based lender said in its annual report on Hungary’s economy, dated March 5 and published on its website today. The IMF provided the bulk of a 20 billion-euro bailout ($26 billion) for the country in 2008. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank reduced its benchmark rate by a quarter-point to a record low 5 percent on March 26, trimming it for an eighth month as it seeks to help the economy exit its second recession in four years. The economy will stagnate this year as the government’s “interference” in the economy through “frequent and unpredictable” policy changes have hurt investments, undercutting recovery prospects, the IMF said. “While the recent monetary-policy easing was appropriate, a pause in the easing cycle seems prudent at this point,” the IMF said in the report. “In fact, with fickle market confidence, deep policy rate cuts could lead to currency depreciation and could risk destabilizing the financial system.” The forint strengthened 0.1 percent to 304.17 per euro by 2:47 p.m. in Budapest. It has weakened 4 percent against Europe’s common currency this year, the second-worst performance among more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg behind the South African rand. Inflation, Budget The Hungarian central bank this week tightened its conditions for monetary easing after new Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy’s first rate decision. Cuts can continue only if market confidence improves, policy makers said in a statement on March 26. Inflation will average 3.2 percent this year and 3.4 percent next year, the IMF said. The central bank estimates price growth below its 3 percent target both years, according to forecasts published yesterday. Consumer prices rose 2.8 percent last month from a year earlier, the slowest pace in seven years. Hungary is set to overshoot its deficit targets in the medium-term, with the shortfall widening to 3.2 percent of economic output this year and 3.4 percent in 2014, the IMF said. The MNB yesterday cut its forecast for the gap to below 3 percent both years. Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who nominated his former economy minister Matolcsy for the central bank job, deployed measures including the nationalization of private-pension fund assets and levied retroactive industry taxes to narrow the budget shortfall and exit a European Union fiscal oversight. The Cabinet expects the deficit to remain below the bloc’s limit of 3 percent of economic output this year and next. The IMF during its review that ended Jan. 26 expressed “deep concern” about the composition of measures underpinning the budget and urged a “significant improvement” in policies, including the gradual elimination of special industry taxes, according to the report. The government estimates 0.9 percent expansion this year, while the central bank forecasts 0.5 percent growth.

U.S. Drought Monitor Report for the Week Ending Oct. 4 (Text),['Mike Sebany'],2011-10-06 12:30:30,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/u-s-drought-monitor-report-for-the-week-ending-oct-4-text-.html,"Following is the text of the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor as released by the National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Nebraska : The Southeast: Areas of heavy rain again affected parts of this area, leading to some drought/dryness reductions in the central Carolinas and finally slicing a hole in the large D3 area centered on Georgia , in particular across the interior southeast, where totals of 4 to 8 inches fell during the last 2 weeks. Similar rainfall during this period in central and west- central Georgia was not quite adequate to bring a classification improvement, but was sufficient to justify scaling back the dryness and drought in southwestern Alabama. Light precipitation led to expansion of D0 to D3 conditions in western South Carolina and adjacent North Carolina , where about half of normal rainfall was observed over the last 30 days. South of these areas, D0 to D3 areas expanded southward in the central Panhandle and in parts of the northern Peninsula. Six- month deficits exceed one foot now in parts of the central Peninsula. Across southern Florida , rain has been spotty but locally heavy recently, and quite a few minor adjustments to the region’s D0 to D2 areas were made this week. The Northeast and Mid-Atlantic: Hit-and-miss light rainfall continued again in and near the areas of dryness in New York and West Virginia. As a result, the D0 areas were reconfigured a bit but their intensity remained unchanged. The South: Over 4 inches of rain soaked part of the central Lower Mississippi Valley, allowing D0 to D3 conditions to be scaled back to the west. Elsewhere, moderate to locally heavy rains fell on northeast Oklahoma and southern Missouri, but appeared insufficient to substantially change drought conditions there. In the rest of the region, the theme of the last year was again played out: Little or no precipitation, and increasing moisture deficits except in small isolated areas. Several small adjustments were made in parts of the region, but of course the sprawling D4 area centered on Texas can’t be depicted any more seriously than it already was. Some larger-scale changes included expansion of D4 with growing shorter-term deficits in southeast Oklahoma , a westward expansion of D0 to D3 conditions along the immediate southwestern Louisiana coast, and the extension of D1 conditions eastward to cover most of Arkansas. Several reports of dry pastures affecting livestock were noted, and despite recent near-normal precipitation, water supplies remain a concern in northwest Arkansas as well as throughout the large area of exceptional drought. The Ohio Valley: A swath of heavy rain (generally 4 to locally 8 inches) wiped out dryness in southern Indiana and adjacent areas, but in other sections, specifically south-central Kentucky and areas from west-central Indiana westward, dryness and drought persisted. The Plains and Midwest: Several inches of rain eased dryness and drought in the upper Peninsula of Michigan , and more moderate rains kept drought depictions unchanged in the remainder of the Great Lakes region. Farther west and south, in areas from central Kansas to northern Missouri and northward through the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota , short-term but intense dryness has led to the rapid development and expansion of dryness and drought. Many areas have received less than one-quarter of normal precipitation in the last 30 to 60 days, along with above normal temperatures. The rapid development of dryness quickly depleted topsoils, even leading to fires in some brush and even crop areas. Drought now covers areas from southeast Iowa to eastern South Dakota, with severe drought now observed in southern Minnesota. The West: A re-assessment of rainfall during the past few months led to a reduction from D4 to D3 conditions for a small area in southeast New Mexico, but otherwise, light precipitation at best kept existing dryness and drought intact from the High Plains westward through the Rockies and Intermountain West. Hawaii , Alaska and Puerto Rico: Drought conditions remained unchanged in Alaska and Puerto Rico this week. In Hawaii, further degradation was noted D1 to D3 conditions expanded in northeastern sections of the Big Island. Farther south, D3 was introduced along part of the southern Big Island coastal areas. Looking Ahead: During October 5 - 10, 2011, a dramatic and long- overdue swath of moisture should push into the central and western Plains states, dropping over an inch of rain on a broad area from the northwestern half of Texas (except the Big Bend) northward through Nebraska and the adjacent Dakotas and Minnesota. Totals may reach 3.5 to 5.5 inches in central Nebraska and also southeastern parts of the Texas Panhandle. Farther east, a tropical system should spread heavy rains across Florida, southeastern Georgia, and adjacent South Carolina. Over 1.5 inch is expected through this region, with as much as 8 inches possible along the southeast Florida coast. Elsewhere, anywhere from a few tenths of an inch to a couple of inches of precipitation should fall on parts of the Rockies, with light rain at best in other areas of dryness and drought. For the ensuing 5 days (October 11 - 15, 2011), odds favor a return to dryness from the central and southern Intermountain West eastward through the southern Plains and middle Mississippi Valley, including most of Texas. In contrast, wet weather is favored in the northern Rockies and in the dry areas of the Southeast.

Fortinet Value Detected After Pricey Cisco Deal: Real M&A,['Brooke Sutherl' ''],2013-07-26 20:09:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/fortinet-value-detected-after-pricey-cisco-deal-real-m-a.html,"After Cisco (CSCO) Systems Inc. paid the highest multiple since 2002 for Sourcefire Inc. (FIRE) , investors are betting other Internet security providers such as Fortinet Inc. (FTNT) can also win premium valuations in a sale. Cisco agreed this week to buy anti-hacking technology maker Sourcefire for about $2.7 billion, or 12 times revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. William Blair & Co. said the next probable targets are Fortinet and Imperva Inc. (IMPV) , which rose to a three-month and record high, respectively, after Cisco’s deal even though they trade for two of the group’s highest valuations, data compiled by Bloomberg show. On the Web, “you’re seeing an increased number of attacks, you’re seeing increased sophistication of attacks and frankly the cost associated with this is reaching a very meaningful level,” Rob Owens, a Portland, Oregon-based analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said in a phone interview. “Some of the large tech bellwethers will be willing to pay higher price tags for the opportunity” to profit from that trend. Technology companies are bolstering their cybersecurity offerings to serve corporations and governments coping with attacks on their computers. Fortinet, a $3.4 billion maker of firewalls, could fetch an 86 percent premium to yesterday’s stock price in a sale, FBR & Co. said. Oppenheimer Holdings Inc. sees Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) , which analysts estimate will boost sales faster than every peer but one through 2015, as another attractive acquisition. Highest Multiple Rick Popko, a spokesman for Sunnyvale, California-based Fortinet, declined to comment on whether it would be interested in selling itself. A representative for Santa Clara, California-based Palo Alto Networks said the company didn’t immediately have a comment. A representative for Redwood Shores, California-based Imperva didn’t respond to a request for comment. Cisco’s bid for Sourcefire valued the company at about $2.7 billion including retention incentives, or 12 times the $233 million in revenue it posted in the past year. That’s the highest multiple paid for a U.S. Internet security provider in more than a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The high price tag highlights the increasing importance of Internet security services as corporations and governments seek better protection from hackers, according to Daniel Ives , a New York-based managing director and analyst at FBR. International Business Machines Corp., Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR) and EMC Corp. are likely to follow Cisco’s lead and strike deals for cybersecurity operators, he said. Hacking Charges After a U.S. Federal Reserve website was breached and denial-of-service attacks disrupted banks, President Barack Obama issued a Feb. 12 executive order directing the government to develop voluntary cybersecurity standards for companies operating the nation’s vital infrastructure. Yesterday, the U.S. charged five people for stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers in what prosecutors called the largest hacking and data breach scheme in American history. “Hacking has become a major risk,” Ives said in a phone interview. The need to protect data “has gone from, ‘Maybe we’ll have that,’ to ‘We need to have that as an organization.’ That’s what’s fueling the growth and that’s what’s fueling” takeover interest. Fortinet and Imperva, a $1.2 billion company that sells data-security software, are the most likely next targets, said Jonathan Ho, a Chicago-based analyst at William Blair. After the Sourcefire acquisition was announced, Fortinet jumped 4.8 percent on July 23 to $21.43, the highest price since April, while Imperva rose 3.5 percent to what was then a record high of $49.66. Not Cheap Today, Fortinet shares fell 1.2 percent to $20.73. Imperva lost 0.6 percent to $50.78. “They’re large assets that can move the needle for some of the bigger organizations,” Ho said in a phone interview. A deal for either wouldn’t be cheap. Fortinet’s price-sales ratio of 6.1 yesterday was higher than 69 percent of computer peripherals and infrastructure software companies valued at more than $1 billion, while Imperva’s multiple of almost 11 topped 93 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Fortinet could fetch $39 a share in a takeover based on the amount paid for Sourcefire, FBR’s Ives said. Oppenheimer’s Shaul Eyal estimates as much as $50, or more than double yesterday’s closing price, and said Cisco could want Fortinet to further bolster its security offerings. For Cisco, “Sourcefire basically brought access to the high-end security markets,” New York-based Eyal said. If Cisco Chief Executive Officer John Chambers wants to supplement that, “Fortinet is the way to do it.” Tripling Revenue Robyn Jenkins-Blum, a spokeswoman for San Jose, California-based Cisco, declined to comment. Palo Alto Networks, which has a market value of $3.5 billion, may also be an attractive target, according to Eyal and Michael Turits, a New York-based analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc. Analysts project the company will generate $713 million of sales in fiscal 2015, almost triple the amount in fiscal 2012, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That’s a faster growth rate than 97 percent of similar-sized peers, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Qualys Inc. (QLYS) , a $507 million maker of cloud-based security technology, and Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT) , a $917 million developer of compliance software, may appeal to technology companies such as Juniper, said Frederick Ziegel, a Petoskey, Michigan-based analyst at Topeka Capital Markets Inc. Playing Chess Juniper “will continue to look at acquisitions in a variety of areas and make investments where we believe they will align with our overall strategy,” said Cindy Ta, a spokeswoman for the Sunnyvale, California-based company. Dave Farmer, a spokesman for Hopkinton, Massachusetts-based EMC, declined to comment on the company’s acquisition strategy, while noting its purchases of Internet security providers including Aveksa Inc. James Sciales, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM (IBM) , also declined to comment, while Sunnyvale, California-based Proofpoint didn’t respond to a request for comment. “There’s a huge consolidation taking place in the enterprise security” industry, Philippe Courtot, the chairman and CEO of Redwood City, California-based Qualys, said in a phone interview. He declined to comment on whether his company would sell itself. Today, shares of Palo Alo Networks fell 1.1 percent to $49.29, while Qualys’s stock price was unchanged at $16.01. Proofpoint advanced 3.3 percent to $26.93. Following Cisco’s Sourcefire deal, the need to stay competitive may be enough for companies such as IBM, Juniper and EMC to justify expensive deals, said Ives of FBR. “It’s a game of chess,” he said. “Cisco made the first move, and the other vendors can’t just sit there twiddling their thumbs.” To contact the reporter on this story: Brooke Sutherland in New York at  bsutherland7@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Sarah Rabil at  srabil@bloomberg.net",['Brooke Sutherl'],"Fortinet Value Detected After Pricey Cisco Deal: Real M&A After Cisco (CSCO) Systems Inc. paid the highest multiple since 2002 for Sourcefire Inc.

International Business Machines Corp., Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR) and EMC Corp. are likely to follow Cisco’s lead and strike deals for cybersecurity operators, he said. Hacking Charges After a U.S. Federal Reserve website was breached and denial-of-service attacks disrupted banks, President Barack Obama issued a Feb. 12 executive order directing the government to develop voluntary cybersecurity standards for companies operating the nation’s vital infrastructure. Yesterday, the U.S. charged five people for stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers in what prosecutors called the largest hacking and data breach scheme in American history. “Hacking has become a major risk,” Ives said in a phone interview. The need to protect data “has gone from, ‘Maybe we’ll have that,’ to ‘We need to have that as an organization.’ That’s what’s fueling the growth and that’s what’s fueling” takeover interest. Fortinet and Imperva, a $1.2 billion company that sells data-security software, are the most likely next targets, said Jonathan Ho, a Chicago-based analyst at William Blair. After the Sourcefire acquisition was announced, Fortinet jumped 4.8 percent on July 23 to $21.43, the highest price since April, while Imperva rose 3.5 percent to what was then a record high of $49.66. Not Cheap Today, Fortinet shares fell 1.2 percent to $20.73. Imperva lost 0.6 percent to $50.78. “They’re large assets that can move the needle for some of the bigger organizations,” Ho said in a phone interview. A deal for either wouldn’t be cheap. Fortinet’s price-sales ratio of 6.1 yesterday was higher than 69 percent of computer peripherals and infrastructure software companies valued at more than $1 billion, while Imperva’s multiple of almost 11 topped 93 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Fortinet could fetch $39 a share in a takeover based on the amount paid for Sourcefire, FBR’s Ives said. Oppenheimer’s Shaul Eyal estimates as much as $50, or more than double yesterday’s closing price, and said Cisco could want Fortinet to further bolster its security offerings. For Cisco, “Sourcefire basically brought access to the high-end security markets,” New York-based Eyal said. If Cisco Chief Executive Officer John Chambers wants to supplement that, “Fortinet is the way to do it.” Tripling Revenue Robyn Jenkins-Blum, a spokeswoman for San Jose, California-based Cisco, declined to comment. Palo Alto Networks, which has a market value of $3.5 billion, may also be an attractive target, according to Eyal and Michael Turits, a New York-based analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc. Analysts project the company will generate $713 million of sales in fiscal 2015, almost triple the amount in fiscal 2012, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That’s a faster growth rate than 97 percent of similar-sized peers, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Qualys Inc. (QLYS) , a $507 million maker of cloud-based security technology, and Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT) , a $917 million developer of compliance software, may appeal to technology companies such as Juniper, said Frederick Ziegel, a Petoskey, Michigan-based analyst at Topeka Capital Markets Inc. Playing Chess Juniper “will continue to look at acquisitions in a variety of areas and make investments where we believe they will align with our overall strategy,” said Cindy Ta, a spokeswoman for the Sunnyvale, California-based company. Dave Farmer, a spokesman for Hopkinton, Massachusetts-based EMC, declined to comment on the company’s acquisition strategy, while noting its purchases of Internet security providers including Aveksa Inc. James Sciales, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM (IBM) , also declined to comment, while Sunnyvale, California-based Proofpoint didn’t respond to a request for comment. “There’s a huge consolidation taking place in the enterprise security” industry, Philippe Courtot, the chairman and CEO of Redwood City, California-based Qualys, said in a phone interview. He declined to comment on whether his company would sell itself. Today, shares of Palo Alo Networks fell 1.1 percent to $49.29, while Qualys’s stock price was unchanged at $16.01. Proofpoint advanced 3.3 percent to $26.93. Following Cisco’s Sourcefire deal, the need to stay competitive may be enough for companies such as IBM, Juniper and EMC to justify expensive deals, said Ives of FBR. “It’s a game of chess,” he said. “Cisco made the first move, and the other vendors can’t just sit there twiddling their thumbs.” To contact the reporter on this story: Brooke Sutherland in New York at  bsutherland7@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Sarah Rabil at  srabil@bloomberg.net",7194,1109,87,48.97645454545457,20,4,False,30,7,3,False,True,5.48512173128945,-1,7,-1,-1,positive,0.5308824777603149,joy,0.5308824777603149,neutral,0.5080458521842957,,0,
Merkel Ally Says Germany Will Win Support for Bank Union Stance,['Rainer Buergin'],2013-07-26 13:32:04,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/merkel-ally-says-germany-will-win-support-for-bank-union-stance.html,"The parliamentary finance-policy spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s bloc said he’s confident that Germany will persuade more European countries to join it in rejecting a single fund to wind down troubled banks. Plans unveiled by the European Commission for a banking union in Europe are “not acceptable” in their present form as they’re incompatible with European law, Klaus-Peter Flosbach said in e-mailed comments responding to questions today. “We advocate a network of national restructuring funds instead of a single European bank resolution fund,” he said. “I’am optimistic that other member states will join our view.” Flosbach’s comments followed a report in today’s Die Welt newspaper that German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble is forging a blocking minority of European Union member states against a commission proposal that might hold taxpayers liable for the costs of winding down troubled banks. Germany has won the support of the U.K., Finland , Estonia and possibly some other EU countries, Die Welt said , citing German government officials it didn’t name. The commission proposal needs the backing of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the 28-nation EU’s population as well as the European Parliament. Winning allies against the commission is one of three options identified by Schaeuble, which include a legal challenge and delaying progress toward banking union until a new commission takes over next year that’s more open to German objections, accroding to Die Welt. ‘Fully Effective’ Germany is not trying to delay the banking union project, a Finance Ministry spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity, declining to comment on the Die Welt article. “Time and again we’ve made it clear in the negotiations that we need to set a Europe-wide mechanism in motion quickly which allows us to wind down large, internationally active banks,” Flosbach said. “Only then can the new European supervisory standards be fully effective.” Michel Barnier, the EU’s financial-services chief, unveiled a proposal on July 10 for a single resolution mechanism that gives the commission the power to decide when banks need to be saved or shut, potentially resulting in the use of public funds. National governments can veto any resolution decision that includes possible recourse to the public purse. In a letter to Barnier dated July 11, Schaeuble said the commission’s proposal “doesn’t match the current legal, political and economic realities and would create major risks.” To contact the reporter on this story: Rainer Buergin in Berlin at  rbuergin1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: James Hertling at  jhertling@bloomberg.net",['Rainer Buergin'],"Merkel Ally Says Germany Will Win Support for Bank Union Stance The parliamentary finance-policy spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s bloc said he’s confident that Germany will persuade more European countries to join it in rejecting a single fund to wind down troubled banks.

"Airbus Wins 1,038 Net Orders in 2011 on Rising Air Travel",['Andrea Rothman' 'Susanna Ray'],2011-10-06 15:53:46,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/airbus-wins-1-038-net-orders-in-2011-on-rising-air-travel-1-.html,"Airbus SAS said it won 1,038 aircraft orders so far this year, outselling Boeing Co. (BA) and edging within reach of a record annual intake following introduction of the A320neo single-aisle plane. The gross intake was 1,179 new purchase contracts, with 141 cancellations in the first nine months of the year, Toulouse, France-based Airbus said today in a statement. That includes 918 neos, a version of Airbus’s single-aisle plane with more fuel- efficient engines. Airbus today won an order for 110 A320s from Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) , to be included in the October tally. Airbus’s record tally for net new orders was in 2007, with contracts for 1,341. The Qantas order booked today plus the prospect of additional orders at the Dubai Air Show in November put Airbus within reach of topping the record. Boeing won 531 gross orders, or 426 after subtracting canceled contracts, according to a listing today on the Chicago- based planemaker’s website. Cancellations, generally for planes ordered some years ago, are counted against the current year tally. Net orders are up from 392 a year earlier. Double-Decker Deliveries For deliveries, Airbus this year has handed over 374 planes, including 296 single aisle planes, 62 widebodies, and 16 A380s. Airbus, a unit of European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co., is aiming to deliver about 530 planes this year, including about 25 double-decker A380s. The next A380 delivery is to China Southern Airlines Co., set for next week. Airbus’s tally so far is again more than Boeing, which it has beat in deliveries every year since 2003. Boeing had handed over 349 aircraft through September, according to a statement today, and forecasts deliveries of 485 to 495 planes in 2011. In the third quarter, deliveries rose to 127 from 124 a year earlier. Planemakers get about 40 percent of their payments from customers upon delivery. While Airbus has booked 918 firm orders from 14 customers for its A320neo since putting the plane on offer last December, Boeing hasn’t yet won any firm contracts for its 737 MAX. The company has said it has 496 preliminary commitments from five customers. Boeing in August announced its intention to build the plane and has been working to complete its configuration. “We continue to work a number of details,” a Boeing spokesman, Marc Birtel , said yesterday. “These commitments will book once those details are finalized, but we are not able to speculate on when that will be.” To contact the reporters on this story: Andrea Rothman in Paris at  aerothman@bloomberg.net ; Susanna Ray in Seattle at  sray7@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: Benedikt Kammel at  bkammel@bloomberg.net ; Ed Dufner at  edufner@bloomberg.net",['Andrea RothmanSusanna Ray'],"Airbus Wins 1,038 Net Orders in 2011 on Rising Air Travel Airbus SAS said it won 1,038 aircraft orders so far this year, outselling Boeing Co.

Elite Advisers’ Wine Fund Favors Burgundy Over Bordeaux,['Guy Collins'],2013-03-16 00:18:08,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-16/elite-advisers-wine-fund-favors-burgundy-over-bordeaux.html,"Elite Advisers SA’s wine fund, one of Europe’s largest, is boosting its holdings of Burgundy over Bordeaux and sees value in the region even after price gains. The investment vehicle, branded Nobles Crus, has a five- year track record and had 102 million euros ($135 million) under management at the end of December. Wines held include a Romanee- Conti 1915 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, harvested during World War I, and Chateau d’Yquem Sauternes dating back to 1811, when Napoleonic troops were fighting in Spain. Historic Burgundies including Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, Henri Jayer and Armand Rousseau are driving prices this year, boosted by Chinese collectors focusing on the region after fueling Bordeaux gains in 2010 and 2011. While Medoc first growths fell last year amid the financial crisis in Europe and the U.S., they have rallied since November, lifting the market and encouraging buying in lesser-known labels. “People are becoming more interested in Burgundy,” Christian Roger, Chief Executive Officer of Gruppo Vino e Finanza, the Milan-based manager for Nobles Crus, said last month. “I don’t think the prices are too high. I think there will be other domaines which will be sought.” The fund aims to keep more than 50 percent of its holdings in Burgundy, and, when appropriate, as much as 55 percent to 60 percent. That fell to 46 percent following purchases of Bordeaux 2009 and 2010 futures, and now managers want to rebalance it. “It’s a strategy that we’ve had since the start, and that I am continuing,” Roger said. The Luxembourg fund, set up by Elite’s founders Miriam Wilson and Michel Tamisier in late 2007, is boosting Burgundy to more than half of managed wine assets. Burgundy Market Auction houses and investment managers have cited demand for Burgundy in the past six months. A 1990 case from Henri Jayer’s Vosne-Romanee Cros Parantoux vineyard sold for $113,525 at Hart Davis Hart in Chicago last month. Jayer, who died in 2006, is one of Burgundy’s most sought-after wine-makers. Wine sold at a Sotheby’s (BID) January sale in London included a case of Chambertin 1999 Armand Rousseau and 12 bottles of the more recent Chambertin Clos de Beze 2005 Armand Rousseau, which each fetched 11,163 pounds ($17,640). Six bottles of Domaine Dujac Echezeaux 1978 made HK$196,800 ($25,380) at Acker Merrall & Condit in Hong Kong the same month. Nobles Crus aims to place 70 percent of its assets in older vintages, 20 percent in wine futures and 10 percent in cash. Wine is bought from private cellars, merchants and restaurants. According to data from Elite Advisers, Nobles Crus returned 7.8 percent in 2012 after gains of 11 percent in 2011, 13 percent in 2010, 9.8 percent in 2009 and 20 percent in 2008. Track Record That compared with declines for the Bordeaux-dominated Liv- ex 100 Fine Wine Index of 8.9 percent in 2012, 15 percent in 2011 and 14 percent in 2008 and gains of 40 percent in 2010 and 16 percent in 2009. The valuation method used by Nobles Crus was subjected to scrutiny by the Financial Times in September after the newspaper sought a Liv-ex estimate of Bordeaux wine in the collection. Elite Advisers responded by commissioning an external report and writing to investors explaining its procedures. “On average we’re now doing basically a 12 percent return per annum,” Wilson told Bloomberg in an interview during a visit to London in January. “We not only have the Bordeaux wines, which are the most well-known in the U.K. market. We have the Burgundy wines, we have the top wines from Italy and from Spain, and this diversification has given us the performance.” Italian Wines Elite Advisers had 63,000 bottles in its collection in Geneva at the end of 2012, according to Roger. Main holdings include Chateau Latour , Chateau Petrus , Chateau Ausone and Chateau Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux, Romanee-Conti DRC in Burgundy, Barolo from Italy and Vega Sicilia from Spain. Monthly valuations are based on four prices for each wine, two from auction houses and two from European or U.K. merchants. Elite Advisers has 10 auction houses and 60 merchants from whom it draws prices, and the fund is audited by Deloitte. “Every piece of pricing that we get is backed up, documented and controlled by our auditors at the end of each year,” Wilson said. Burgundies held by the fund as of December 2011, the latest date for which detailed information is available, included more than 40 vintages of Romanee-Conti spanning the past century and Jayer Cros Parantoux from 13 separate years back to 1978.

WTI Crude Caps Fourth Weekly Advance and Surpasses Brent,['Moming Zhou'],2013-07-19 20:25:13,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/wti-rises-to-16-month-high-and-narrows-discount-to-brent.html,"West Texas Intermediate capped a fourth weekly gain as the U.S. showed signs of economic recovery and as crude inventories dropped. WTI exceeded Brent for the first time since 2010 in intraday trading. Prices settled at a 16-month high as Moody’s Investors Service revised the U.S.’s Aaa credit-rating outlook to stable from negative. Crude supplies tumbled 27.1 million barrels in three weeks ended July 12, the most in weekly statistics dating to 1982. WTI surpassed Brent by as much as 3 cents as pipeline and rail shipments helped clear a U.S. bottleneck. “Improved economic conditions here in the United States continue to boost the market,” said Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford , Connecticut. “We have a tightening supply outlook. The Brent-WTI spread has moved a lot. Nothing seems to be able to stop it.” WTI for August delivery, which expires on July 22, settled up 1 cent at $108.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level since March 19, 2012. Trading was 28 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day at 2:48 p.m. Prices increased 2 percent this week, extending July’s gain to 12 percent. The more-active September contract advanced 6 cents to $107.87. Brent for September settlement slipped 63 cents, or 0.6 percent, to end the session at $108.07 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe Exchange. Volume was 1.1 percent above 100-day average. The contract fell below WTI in intraday trading for the first time since Aug. 17, 2010. Brent settled at a 20-cent premium to the U.S. benchmark. U.S. Economy Growth in the U.S. economy, “while moderate,” is proceeding even as the U.S. has enacted tax increases and spending reductions that have improved the nation’s debt trajectory, Moody’s said yesterday in a statement. Moody’s assigned the negative outlook in August 2011, warning of a possible downgrade on concern that fiscal discipline was eroding and the economy was weakening. “We had a little bit of a risk-on trade based on economic outlook,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group in Chicago. “Inventories have come down a lot.” U.S. crude stockpiles dropped to 367 million barrels last week, the lowest level since Jan. 18, the Energy Information Administration reported July 17. Stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma , the biggest oil-storage hub, decreased 882,000 barrels to 46.1 million, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm. Improving Transport The convergence between Brent, a pricing benchmark for more than half the world’s oil, and WTI shows how better pipeline networks and the use of rail have helped to unlock a supply glut at Cushing. WTI, the bellwether U.S. crude, had typically been the more expensive grade until mid-2010. “The key factor driving WTI is the narrowing Brent-WTI spread, which is signaling the bottleneck is alleviating,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees $1.4 billion. Crude also advanced as the dollar weakened after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke damped speculation that a reduction of U.S. monetary stimulus was imminent. The currency fell as much as 0.3 percent to $1.3154 per euro from yesterday’s $1.3109. A weaker dollar boosts oil’s investment appeal. Relative Strength Prices fell 0.5 percent in intraday trading on speculation this month’s gain has been excessive. WTI’s 14-day relative strength index was 75.2, staying above 70 for an 11th day, a sign that prices may decline. The streak of 11 days over 70 is the longest since 2002. Some investors start selling contracts when the reading crosses that threshold, seen as a sign that speculative buying has driven prices unreasonably high. “The speed of the rise is too fast,” said Chris Barber, a senior analyst at Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield, Massachusetts. “Investors were a little overexuberant.” Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in September was 21.8 percent, compared with 20.2 percent yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 693,771 contracts as of 3:12 p.m. It totaled 715,326 contracts yesterday, 8.5 percent above the three-month average.

WTI exceeded Brent for the first time since 2010 in intraday trading. Prices settled at a 16-month high as Moody’s Investors Service revised the U.S.’s Aaa credit-rating outlook to stable from negative. Crude supplies tumbled 27.1 million barrels in three weeks ended July 12, the most in weekly statistics dating to 1982. WTI surpassed Brent by as much as 3 cents as pipeline and rail shipments helped clear a U.S. bottleneck. “Improved economic conditions here in the United States continue to boost the market,” said Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford , Connecticut. “We have a tightening supply outlook. The Brent-WTI spread has moved a lot. Nothing seems to be able to stop it.” WTI for August delivery, which expires on July 22, settled up 1 cent at $108.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level since March 19, 2012. Trading was 28 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day at 2:48 p.m. Prices increased 2 percent this week, extending July’s gain to 12 percent. The more-active September contract advanced 6 cents to $107.87. Brent for September settlement slipped 63 cents, or 0.6 percent, to end the session at $108.07 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe Exchange. Volume was 1.1 percent above 100-day average. The contract fell below WTI in intraday trading for the first time since Aug. 17, 2010. Brent settled at a 20-cent premium to the U.S. benchmark. U.S. Economy Growth in the U.S. economy, “while moderate,” is proceeding even as the U.S. has enacted tax increases and spending reductions that have improved the nation’s debt trajectory, Moody’s said yesterday in a statement. Moody’s assigned the negative outlook in August 2011, warning of a possible downgrade on concern that fiscal discipline was eroding and the economy was weakening. “We had a little bit of a risk-on trade based on economic outlook,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group in Chicago. “Inventories have come down a lot.” U.S. crude stockpiles dropped to 367 million barrels last week, the lowest level since Jan. 18, the Energy Information Administration reported July 17. Stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma , the biggest oil-storage hub, decreased 882,000 barrels to 46.1 million, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm. Improving Transport The convergence between Brent, a pricing benchmark for more than half the world’s oil, and WTI shows how better pipeline networks and the use of rail have helped to unlock a supply glut at Cushing. WTI, the bellwether U.S. crude, had typically been the more expensive grade until mid-2010. “The key factor driving WTI is the narrowing Brent-WTI spread, which is signaling the bottleneck is alleviating,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees $1.4 billion. Crude also advanced as the dollar weakened after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke damped speculation that a reduction of U.S. monetary stimulus was imminent. The currency fell as much as 0.3 percent to $1.3154 per euro from yesterday’s $1.3109. A weaker dollar boosts oil’s investment appeal.

Oil Hits Futures as MSCI Lifts Sberbank: Russia Overnight,['Leon Lazaroff' 'Ksenia Galouchko'],2012-11-16 03:05:05,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/oil-hits-futures-as-msci-lifts-sberbank-russia-overnight.html,"Russian stock futures sank in New York as crude, the nation’s biggest export earner, dropped for the third time in four days. Futures expiring in December on Russia ’s RTS Index slipped 0.4 percent to 137,240 in U.S. trading hours as expected swings in the contracts rose 1.1 percent, according to the Russian Volatility Index. OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) , Russia’s biggest lender, led a 0.3 percent advance in the Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN) of the most-traded Russian companies in the U.S. VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) and OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) tumbled as rival OAO MegaFon resumed marketing for its initial share offering. Oil sank 1 percent yesterday after reports showed American jobless claims rose more than economists estimated last week and manufacturing shrunk in New York and Philadelphia. U.S. stockpiles of oil -- which along with natural gas contributes about 50 percent of Russian government revenue -- rose last week as production jumped to an 18-year high, the Department of Energy said yesterday. “When oil slumped suddenly around midday, the Russian futures went down with them,” Ilya Kravets, who helps manage $100 million in assets, including Russian equities, at Daniloff Capital LLC, said by phone in New York yesterday. “The futures are reflecting what we’ll see in the market, which is going to be a letdown primarily because of the oil price.” The Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, added 1.1 percent to $26.54 in New York, rising for the first time in three days. Russia’s benchmark Micex Index (INDEXCF) gained 1 percent yesterday to 1,386.25 as Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip stoked gains in oil during the European trading day. Urals Declines Crude oil for December delivery slumped to $85.45 a barrel by the end of trading yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange , extending the decline this year to 14 percent. Brent oil for January settlement fell 0.4 percent to $108.01 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, while Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, slipped 0.8 percent to $107.17. American depositary receipts of state-controlled Sberbank surged 2.8 percent to $10.84 in New York, the biggest one-day climb since Sept. 14. The advance followed a 1.7 percent climb in the lender’s Micex-traded stock to 86.12 rubles, or the equivalent of $2.72. The ADRs, which equal four ordinary shares, traded at the smallest discount to Moscow since Oct. 31. Telenor CFO Moscow-based Sberbank had its weighting in MSCI Inc.’s Russia Index boosted by 2.5 percentage points to 14.4 percent, according to a report on MSCI’s website. The increase “helps bring funds into the stock,” as many global portfolios track MSCI’s indexes, Stanislav Kopylov, who helps manage about $3.4 billion at UralSib Capital in Moscow, including Sberbank shares, said by phone yesterday. Futures on the ruble were little changed in New York at 31.86 per dollar. Russia’s currency was also steady in Moscow yesterday at 31.6624 versus the greenback. VimpelCom, the world’s sixth-biggest mobile phone company by subscribers, dropped 2.6 percent to $10.66 in New York yesterday, a two-month low. VimpelCom got 42 percent of revenue from Russia last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nordic phone company Telenor ASA (TEL) , which has been engaged in a fight for control of VimpelCom with fellow investor Altimo, has no plans to sell its stake in the company, Chief Financial Officer Richard Olav Aa said in an interview in Barcelona yesterday. Telenor is a long-term shareholder in VimpelCom, he said. ‘Feeling the Hit’ MegaFon, Russia’s second-largest mobile-phone operator, plans to raise as much as $2.1 billion in the biggest initial public offering by a Russian company since United Co. Rusal, the world’s biggest aluminum producer, issued stock almost three years ago. MegaFon is resuming marketing for its IPO after suspending the campaign last month to amend details of the prospectus. Mobile TeleSystems, Russia’s biggest mobile company known as MTS, sank 1.5 percent to $16.57 in the U.S., the lowest level since June 25. MTS’ Micex-listed shares added 1.3 percent in Moscow, shrinking their discount to the ADRs to 1.9 percent, the least in a year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “Both VimpelCom and MTS are feeling the hit now that the MegaFon IPO is back on,” Daniloff’s Kravets said. “VimpelCom is down a little more because MegaFon is taking some market share from them.” United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer, dropped 0.7 percent to HK$4.43 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:02 a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.6 percent.

An “incomplete harvest is ensured,” Tetiana Adamenko, head of the agro-meteorology department at the weather center, said by phone today from Kiev. Dryness caused farmers to leave about 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million acres) bare, she said. Around 18 percent of winter wheat was sown after the optimal period and 20 percent was never planted. As much as half of the grain sown for winter will be at risk and dependent on weather, according to Adamenko. Farmers may seed barley next spring in fields where crops were lost because of weather, she said. Temperatures will decline and rain is likely across most of Ukraine starting Oct. 8, Adamenko said.

The president’s decree signed May 25 required that cleared areas bordering rivers wider than 10 meters be replanted out to 20 meters on each bank. Lawmakers reduced that distance to 15 meters. On larger tracts, the protection was lowered from 30 meters to 20 meters. Lawmakers have also authorized the use of fruit trees for replanting.  “The president has repeatedly showed that the government is only committed to the original version of the decree,” Senator Eduardo Braga, leader of the government coalition in the Senate, said. “The possibility of another veto is real,” he told reporters in Brasilia. Rousseff had previously vetoed 12 items from a bill approved by Congress in April to replace the country’s 1965 forest legislation. The rejected articles reduced the area that farmers were required to preserve. Instead of the vetoed rules, Rousseff signed a decree that withdraws fines charged for illegal deforestation as long as farmers agree to replant a portion of the area.

Hertz Dollar Thrifty Purchase Cleared by U.S. Regulator,['Mark Clothier' 'Sara Forden'],2012-11-16 14:45:19,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/hertz-dollar-thrifty-purchase-cleared-by-u-s-regulator.html,"Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) ’s $2.6 billion purchase of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. was cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators yesterday after almost a half-decade of trying and some late-hour concessions for regulators concerned the deal would limit competition. Hertz agreed to sell 62 Advantage brand outlets along with the rights to operate 29 Dollar Thrifty on-airport locations, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said in a statement. Sixteen of the airport outlets were part of the original deal between the companies, and the FTC demanded that 13 more be sold after the deal closes to maintain competition in those markets. The acquisition solidifies Hertz’s place as the second- biggest in the U.S. rental-car market, ahead of Avis Budget Group Inc. (CAR) Enterprise Holdings Inc., which operates the Enterprise, Alamo and National brands, is the biggest. Giving Hertz two lower-priced leisure brands to balance its premium namesake brand is a positive for the industry, said Chris Agnew, a Stamford , Connecticut-based analyst at MKM Partners LLC. “It’s good for balanced, rational competition for the main companies to have dual-brand strategies,” Agnew said yesterday in a telephone interview. “Hertz with only one main brand had created an imbalance.” The FTC voted 4-1 in favor of approval after concessions by Hertz, made in talks over the past two weeks, to shed the additional locations to ease antitrust concerns as the market shrunk from four major companies to three, people familiar with the process said. Hertz may be able to keep Dollar and Thrifty counters at some of those airports, Hertz said in its statement. Market Share Together, Hertz, Enterprise and Avis control about 75 percent of the market, with Dollar Thrifty holding 5 percent, according to a February report from IBISWorld, the Santa Monica , California-based industry researcher. No other competitor has more than 1 percent of this year’s $30.5 billion market in the U.S., according to IBISWorld. Earlier in its negotiations with the agency, Hertz pledged to sell its 62 Advantage-brand outlets in the U.S. Franchise Services of North America Inc. and Macquarie Group Ltd.’s Macquarie Capital. The purchase price was $16 million, one person with knowledge of the situation has said. The sale is dependent upon Hertz completing the acquisition of Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Dollar Thrifty. When Hertz announced the acquisition in late August, it said it expected at least $160 million in annual cost-savings and sales-growth potential. The moves to address the FTC’s concerns shouldn’t change the benefit of the deal for Hertz, Fred Lowrance, a Nashville, Tennessee-based analyst at Avondale Partners LLC, said in an interview. Benefits Maintained “These concessions are not a needle-mover, for Hertz at least,” Lowrance said. “Maybe it was for the FTC and their view of what competition was like in the rental-car industry, but this doesn’t change the economics of the deal.” The FTC alleged that the acquisition as originally proposed would have led to “substantially more concentration in 72 airport rental-car markets” and by eliminating head-to-head competition between Hertz and Dollar Thrifty. “American consumers rent more than 50 million vehicles at airports nationwide each year, spending $11 billion, so this is a real pocketbook issue for everyday people,” FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said in the statement. “Today’s bipartisan action by the FTC will ensure that consumers are not forced to pay higher prices for rental cars when they travel.” One Dissenter Commissioner Tom Rosch dissented, saying he found the divestitures “inadequate to resolve the competitive concerns at several dozen other airports,” according to the statement. Rosch said he would have challenged the transaction because of the “significant risk” it could lead to higher prices and disadvantage consumers in other ways through coordinated actions by the remaining industry players. The four largest companies -- Enterprise, Hertz, Avis Budget Group Inc. and Dollar Thrifty -- have controlled 80 percent of the U.S. market, according to IBISWorld. Enterprise will command 38 percent of the $30.5 billion market in the U.S. this year, Hertz will have 18.9 percent, followed by Avis with 18.5 percent and Dollar Thrifty with about 5 percent. The $87.50-a-share offer represents an 8 percent premium to Dollar Thrifty’s closing price of $81 (DTG) on Aug. 24. The price is more than twice the $41-a-share Hertz offered in April 2010. Franchise Services, which operates the U-Save brand, is run by Co-Chief Executive Officer Sanford Miller, the CEO of Budget Group Inc. from 1997 to 2004. While the FTC staff raised concerns about the strength of the buyer and its ability to become a viable competitor, those questions weren’t deal- breakers with regulators, the people said. April 2007 Hertz began its pursuit of Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Dollar Thrifty in April 2007 and made a formal bid of about $1.2 billion in 2010 that Dollar Thrifty shareholders rejected. Park Ridge , New Jersey-based Hertz made another offer last year that it later withdrew, citing market conditions. Hertz, with 8,750 outlets worldwide, has more than 3,900 U.S. locations, while Dollar Thrifty has about 280 corporate- owned outlets in the U.S. and Canada. Last month, Hertz extended the FTC’s legal deadline for ruling on the deal to Nov. 16 from Oct. 31 because the agency hadn’t finished its review of information provided by the companies, Hertz said in a statement. When Hertz announced the proposed acquisition on Aug. 26, it said FTC approval was expected by mid-October. People familiar with the deal said it ran into resistance from some of the agency’s staff and commissioners. All Concerns “The FTC requirement to add assets to the divestiture package demonstrates the importance of ensuring that all competition law concerns are resolved to obtain commission approval,” said William Vigdor, an antitrust lawyer with Vinson & Elkins LLP in Washington , who served at the FTC for six years. Hertz and Dollar Thrifty said the transaction is a two-step process starting with a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of Dollar Thrifty followed by a cash merger to acquire any remaining shares of common stock. The tender offer closes at 5 p.m. New York time. Dollar Thrifty rose 0.6 percent to $87.48 at 9:40 a.m. in New York, and Hertz jumped 3.1 percent to $14.69.

(HTZ) ’s $2.6 billion purchase of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. was cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators yesterday after almost a half-decade of trying and some late-hour concessions for regulators concerned the deal would limit competition. Hertz agreed to sell 62 Advantage brand outlets along with the rights to operate 29 Dollar Thrifty on-airport locations, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said in a statement. Sixteen of the airport outlets were part of the original deal between the companies, and the FTC demanded that 13 more be sold after the deal closes to maintain competition in those markets. The acquisition solidifies Hertz’s place as the second- biggest in the U.S. rental-car market, ahead of Avis Budget Group Inc.

African Catholics Look to Black Pope to Safeguard Tradition,['Fred Ojambo' 'Dulue Mbachu' 'Mike Cohen'],2013-03-11 14:01:48,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/african-catholics-look-to-first-black-pope-to-protect-tradition.html,"Ugandan property broker Joseph Nsubuga has a message for those who think choosing an African pope would lead the Catholic church to become more flexible on such divisive social issues as abortion or homosexuality: Think again. “An African pope would fight the homosexuality vice which has infiltrated our society,” the father of six said as he exited Sunday mass in the Kampala suburb of Kiwatule on Feb. 17. “The Pope would fight abortions and contraceptives since they are condemned by the faith.” Africa is the fastest-growing region for a church with 1.2 billion members worldwide. The number of baptized Catholics on the continent more than tripled between 1980 and 2010 to 185.6 million, offsetting a decline in the flock in Europe and slower growth in the U.S. The shifting Catholic demographics and the African faithful’s conservative social values have helped make Ghana ’s Cardinal Peter Turkson one of the favorites to succeed Benedict XVI at oddsmakers William Hill Plc (WMH) and Paddy Power Plc. “The church is doing well here because Africans are notoriously religious,” Emmanuel Abbey-Quaye, assistant secretary general of the Ghana Catholic Bishops’ Conference, said in a Feb. 11 interview in the capital, Accra. “Africans have strong cultural values which, in consonance with the church, frown on many issues including homosexuality.” Naming an African pontiff would break from a tradition that the Catholic church be headed by a European which dates back to the death of Syrian Gregory III in 741. Conclave Begins Tomorrow the 115 voting Cardinals, including 11 Africans , will be sequestered in the Sistine Chapel to begin their secret conclave to choose a new pope. Given that more than half were appointed by Benedict, with the rest named by John Paul II , there is little reason to expect a new pope to be any more progressive on social issues, especially if he’s African. Much of the opening day of the conclave is taken up by prayer and there may be a single vote in the afternoon, limiting the chance for a decision tomorrow. On the following days, the Cardinals will cast as many as four ballots. “If the Catholic church is serious about tradition and wants to continue that tradition, it would be in their interest to look at an African candidate,” Rothney Tshaka, a theology professor at the University of South Africa , said in a Feb. 14 phone interview from Pretoria. “People who are of African descent or on the African continent identify with conservative values.” Criminalizing Homosexuality Of the 68 countries that ban abortion or permit it only to save a woman’s life, 21 are in Africa, according to the New York-based Center for Productive Rights. Of the continent’s 55 nations, only South Africa and Tunisia allow abortion on demand. Africa accounts for 36 of the 78 countries that criminalize homosexuality, according to the Brussels-based International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association. The continent has “the worst laws on the books when it comes to homosexuality and other sexual minorities, a phenomenon which is in part rooted in bad colonial-era laws and political situations, religious autonomy, strong negative belief in cultural and family values and the evil of patriarchy,” the group said in a March 2012 report. Seeking Change Some African Catholics nevertheless believe the new pope needs to embrace more progressive views and do more to tackle what they see as social and economic injustice. For Nigerian engineer Donatus Ezekwo, 56, Catholicism has provided an alternative to his grandparents’ traditions, such as a veneration for their ancestors and a conformity to an ethnic and clan identity, while preserving some of the values they espoused. He backs the church’s opposition to homosexuality, yet still sees scope for modernization in other areas. “On celibacy, I think most Africans appreciate it’s a tall order and are sympathetic to a review,” he said while waiting for the traffic to disperse after Feb. 17 mass at the Holy Trinity church in Abuja. “That’s the sort of agenda I would expect an African pope to pursue at the Vatican.” Accountant Bayo Arowolo, 35, one of Ezekwo’s fellow congregants, wants Benedict’s successor to ensure the church focuses on helping the more than 400 million Africans who live on less than $2 a day. “While the Latin American church found a new mission in working against poverty, in Africa it has remained complicit and profited despite poverty,” he said. Appointing “an African pope will only be meaningful if he can put these issues on the agenda, otherwise it will just be another symbolic gesture and no more than that.” Geographic Breakdown The church’s African flock is biggest in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has 37.8 million Catholics, followed by Nigeria with 23.8 million and Uganda with 14.2 million. The church’s ranks grew about 40 percent in the three countries between 2000 and 2010. The north of the continent remains predominantly Muslim -- Libya , Morocco , Niger , Tunisia and Algeria each have less than 100,000 Catholics. Choosing an African pope would help raise the profile of the world’s poorest continent within the church. “An African pope will be recognition that African Catholicism has come of age,” Martin Essilfie, parish priest at the Sacred Heart church in the central Ghanaian town of Winneba, said in a Feb. 16 interview. It will “integrate African culture and socio-economic priorities into mainstream Catholicism.” To contact the reporters on this story: Mike Cohen in Cape Town at mcohen21@bloomberg.net ; Dulue Mbachu at dmbachu@bloomberg.net ; Fred Ojambo in Kampala at fojambo@bloomberg.net.

German 10-Year Bunds Pare Weekly Gain on Spain Bailout Reports,['David Goodman' 'Lukanyo Mny' 'a'],2012-09-21 15:36:46,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/italian-bonds-set-for-3rd-weekly-gain-as-official-rules-out-aid.html,"German 10-year bunds declined, paring their biggest weekly advance in almost a month, after a report said euro-region policy makers will unveil a financial bailout program for Spain as early as next week. Italian 10-year securities dropped, even as a senior government official said the nation won’t request external aid unless increased borrowing costs restrict its access to bond markets. Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos is in talks with European Commission authorities to facilitate a new rescue program that will be presented on Sept. 27, the Financial Times reported, citing unidentified officials involved in the discussions. “The news that talks between EU authorities and Spain are going on in the background has led to an improvement in risk appetite,” said Brian Barry , an analyst at Investec Bank Plc in London. “Positive newsflow from the periphery overnight has resulted in the bid for safe-haven assets tapering back.” Germany ’s 10-year yield climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.6 percent at 4:33 p.m. London time. It has dropped 11 basis points this week, the most since the five- day period ending Aug. 24. The 1.5 percent security due in September 2022 fell 0.195, or 1.95 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,303) face amount, to 99.13. German bonds returned 2.5 percent this year through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities added 1.4 percent, while Italy’s earned 16 percent. Positive Returns The bonds of every euro-region nation tracked by the EFFAS indexes have recorded positive returns this quarter through yesterday. German bunds were the worst performers with a 0.5 percent gain, the indexes show. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi unveiled details of the ECB’s asset-purchase plan on Sept. 6, saying activation was dependent on countries asking for help. The Federal Reserve said on Sept. 13 it would buy mortgage securities to bolster the recovery, while the Bank of Japan (8301) unexpectedly added 10 trillion yen ($128 billion) to its stimulus program on Sept. 19. The ECB has reduced the risk “of a euro-zone breakdown and has led to a sharp tightening of peripheral bond yields,” said Elwin de Groot, a senior market economist at Rabobank Nederland in Utrecht. “We’ve also seen many global central banks increase monetary policy stimulus. These can be seen as creating a tide that lifts all boats.” Structural Measures The plan for Spain will focus on structural measures long sought by the EU, not new taxes or spending cuts, though the European Commission may still request more austerity measures to meet existing budget targets, the Financial Times said. Spanish 10-year yields were little changed at 5.77 percent. The rate climbed eight basis points yesterday as the nation sold 4.8 billion euros of debt due in 2015 and 2022. “There won’t be any nation that voluntarily, with a preemptive move, even if rationally justified, would go to an international body and say, ‘I give up my national sovereignty,’” Gianfranco Polillo, Italy’s undersecretary of finance, said in an interview in Rome late yesterday. “I rule it out for Italy and for any other country.” Italy’s 10-year yield added six basis points to 5.05 percent. The rate has risen three basis points this week.

"Bahamas Approves Oil Exploration as Debt Rises, Minister Says",['Adam Williams'],2013-03-11 16:41:59,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/bahamas-approves-oil-exploration-as-debt-rises-minister-says.html,"The Bahamas government approved offshore oil exploration as the island nation seeks new revenue to help reduce its debt burden, Environment & Housing Minister Kenred Dorsett said. Exploration will probably begin this year to gauge if the archipelago contains enough oil to be commercially viable, Dorsett said in a statement yesterday. Oil estimates from the exploration are expected to be available by late 2014 and a national referendum would be held prior to any drilling or development, he said. “Exploration drilling is of course the only way the Bahamian people will be able to get a scientific answer to the burning question as to whether petroleum reserves even exist in commercial quantities in our waters,” Dorsett said. “The discovery of oil in The Bahamas would almost certainly prove to be economically transformative for our nation for many generations to come.” Government debt rose to 53 percent of gross domestic product last year from 32 percent in 2007, according to a December report by Moody’s Investor Services. The largely tourism-based economy located southeast of Florida contracted at an average rate of 0.8 percent between 2007 and 2011 and unemployment remains close to 15 percent, according to Moody’s. Messages left at the Environment Ministry by Bloomberg News weren’t immediately returned. New regulations will be drafted to ensure best practices and environmental protection during exploration, Dorsett said.

College Stars Deserve Real Pay for Video-Game Touchdowns,['Jonathan Mahler'],2013-07-21 22:00:37,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/college-stars-deserve-real-pay-for-video-game-touchdowns.html,"The National Collegiate Athletic Association isn’t renewing its licensing contract with Electronic Arts for a college football video game. This may not exactly strike you as big news, and in a sense it’s not: The NCAA deal was worth all of $545,000 a year. (By way of perspective, EA does close to $4 billion in annual revenues.) But it says a lot about the perverse mindset of the NCAA, and the forces of change that are finally bearing down on the ethically bankrupt world of college sports. Why did the NCAA cancel the contract? The association blamed “the current business climate and costs of litigation.” What they’re referring to, specifically, is the Ed O’Bannon case, an antitrust lawsuit filed in 2009 by the former UCLA All-America basketball player and a handful of other ex-college athletes who don’t think the NCAA should be profiting from their images without sharing the royalties. My hunch is that the NCAA wasn’t just hoping to (belatedly) limit its legal exposure. It was also hoping to drum up some public sympathy for its cause. The association probably assumed that EA's game-makers would respond to losing the licensing deal by making its product more generic, that they would stop modeling players after real-life counterparts and that video-game users would, in turn, blame O’Bannon. (There’s already no shortage of anti-O’Bannon venom from video gamers on Twitter.) In other words, the NCAA assumed that a for-profit, publicly traded company would opt to make a product less desirable. Surprise! EA instead announced that its college football game would continue to feature college teams and conferences. It’s simply going to enter into new agreements with those teams and conferences that bypass the NCAA. The question now is how far EA will go. Will they continue the farce of disguising players just enough to claim deniability (however implausible), or will they choose to make their product more realistic, and thus more popular? Of course, for EA to go the latter route, schools will have to allow them to use the likenesses of players, which will make the absurdity of not compensating those players that much more apparent. Is it too much to hope that schools will come to their senses and realize it’s time to stop exploiting athletes? Probably. But if things break the right way in the O’Bannon case, that realization may be forced on them by a federal judge. (Jonathan Mahler is a Bloomberg View columnist.

Newcastle defeated Stoke 2-1. Steven Gerrard got Liverpool’s winning goal from the penalty spot with eight minutes left at Anfield yesterday. Stewart Downing had tied it after Jan Vertonghen scored twice to put Spurs 2-1 ahead following Luis Suarez ’s opening goal. Liverpool climbed up two places to sixth in the standings, seven points behind fourth-place Chelsea, after ending Tottenham’s 12-match unbeaten league run. Spurs stayed in third. “Today was a stringent test and they came through it,” Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers told reporters. “We know where we want to be eventually but this is another marker for us in terms of our growth.” Suarez opened the scoring in the 21st minute, poking the ball in from close range following Jose Enrique ’s pass. It was his 29th goal of the season and seventh in the past four games. Vertonghen scored in the 45th and 53rd minutes with a header and shot as Tottenham took a 2-1 lead, Gareth Bale playing a part in both goals. Misjudged back-passes by Kyle Walker and Jermain Defoe led to Spurs losing the game. Downing made it 2-2 for the Reds in the 66th minute, then Gerrard converted an 82nd-minute penalty after Suarez was fouled. “We lost control of the game when things looked to be going our way, which was more down to a couple of mistakes we did rather than to Liverpool’s merit,” Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas said. Cisse’s Winner Stoke took the lead at Newcastle in the 67th minute with a penalty kick by Jonathan Walters. Yohan Cabaye tied the game with a free kick five minutes later and Papiss Cisse grabbed the winner in the second minute of stoppage time. Manchester United leads the standings with 71 points, 12 more than defending champion Manchester City. Tottenham, which has played one more game than the other teams in the top five, has 54 with Chelsea two points further back. Arsenal has 47. Liverpool has 45 points in sixth. Stoke and Newcastle, who both have 33 points, are 11th and 13th, respectively. Two days ago, Aston Villa moved out of the three-team relegation zone with a 2-1 win at Reading. Last-place Queens Park Rangers beat Sunderland 3-1, West Brom defeated Swansea 2-1, and Norwich and Southampton drew 0-0.

Spurs stayed in third. “Today was a stringent test and they came through it,” Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers told reporters. “We know where we want to be eventually but this is another marker for us in terms of our growth.” Suarez opened the scoring in the 21st minute, poking the ball in from close range following Jose Enrique ’s pass. It was his 29th goal of the season and seventh in the past four games. Vertonghen scored in the 45th and 53rd minutes with a header and shot as Tottenham took a 2-1 lead, Gareth Bale playing a part in both goals. Misjudged back-passes by Kyle Walker and Jermain Defoe led to Spurs losing the game. Downing made it 2-2 for the Reds in the 66th minute, then Gerrard converted an 82nd-minute penalty after Suarez was fouled. “We lost control of the game when things looked to be going our way, which was more down to a couple of mistakes we did rather than to Liverpool’s merit,” Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas said. Cisse’s Winner Stoke took the lead at Newcastle in the 67th minute with a penalty kick by Jonathan Walters. Yohan Cabaye tied the game with a free kick five minutes later and Papiss Cisse grabbed the winner in the second minute of stoppage time. Manchester United leads the standings with 71 points, 12 more than defending champion Manchester City. Tottenham, which has played one more game than the other teams in the top five, has 54 with Chelsea two points further back. Arsenal has 47. Liverpool has 45 points in sixth. Stoke and Newcastle, who both have 33 points, are 11th and 13th, respectively. Two days ago, Aston Villa moved out of the three-team relegation zone with a 2-1 win at Reading. Last-place Queens Park Rangers beat Sunderland 3-1, West Brom defeated Swansea 2-1, and Norwich and Southampton drew 0-0.

The Arlington, Texas, Police Department is also investigating the incident, where the woman fell from the ride, according to a statement. Emergency personnel responded to the accident at about 6:45 p.m. local time and pronounced her dead at the scene. The attraction has been closed since the incident, Sharon Parker, a theme-park spokeswoman, said via e-mail. She declined to identify the woman or provide any details of the accident until the investigation by Grand Prairie, Texas-based Six Flags is complete. “We are committed to determining the cause of this tragic accident and will utilize every resource throughout this process,” Parker said in the statement. The Dallas Morning News cited eyewitness reports saying that the woman’s safety restraint may have been loose. Investigators interviewed witnesses who said the woman was thrown from the ride as it rounded a turn, the newspaper said. The Texas Giant debuted in 1990 as a wooden coaster, and was rebuilt and re-introduced in April 2011 as a hybrid wood and steel coaster, according to the park’s website.

(AAPL) veteran responsible for building the iTunes platform and cultivating the planned iCloud file-sharing service. Cue, who had been vice president of the Cupertino, California-based company’s Internet services business, was promoted by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook in September to senior vice president. The promotion expanded Cue’s oversight of the App Store, which sells downloadable software for iPads and iPhones, as well as the iAd mobile-ad business that competes with Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s AdMob. In his earlier roles in building iTunes music, movie and TV service, Cue handled negotiations with Hollywood studios and record companies. A gregarious man known for an easy sense of humor, Cue often has done most of the negotiations, with Jobs coming in to close when necessary, according to Tim Bajarin, founder of Campbell, California-based consulting firm Creative Strategies Inc. “He’s a key guy,” Bajarin said. “But if you didn’t know any better, you wouldn’t think so” upon meeting him, he said. The promotion reflected his role in building iTunes and the App Store , and it puts him on the same level as such Apple executives as design head Jonathan Ive and iPhone software chief Scott Forstall. “Apple is a company and culture unlike any other in the world and leaders like Eddy get that,” Cook wrote in the memo announcing the promotion. “Apple is in their blood.” Digital Life Cue was a manager in Apple’s customer support unit in 1997 when Jobs returned to the company after an ouster more than a decade earlier. Jobs put Cue in charge of one of his first efforts: to build an online store. The success of the store helped Apple sell directly to customers rather than through a less efficient network of dealers and third-party retailers. Cue later helped develop the initial iTunes store as well as the processes that would make purchasing songs or downloading apps simple and secure. One of the recent steps in the company’s evolution is iCloud, which will let users access content across multiple Apple devices without having to physically transfer files from hard drive to hard drive.

Toho Zinc Raises Lead Surcharge by 50% for Buyers in Japan,['Jae Hur' 'Ichiro Suzuki'],2013-03-11 07:58:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/toho-zinc-raises-lead-surcharge-by-50-for-buyers-in-japan-1-.html,"Toho Zinc Co. (5707) , a Japanese non- ferrous metal smelter, said it raised fees on lead sales by 50 percent for the year starting in April, increasing costs for battery makers. The Tokyo-based company, which is Japan ’s biggest refiner of lead and second-biggest of zinc, pushed the surcharge buyers pay over the London Metal Exchange’s cash price for lead to the highest level in at least 20 years, said Kimiyasu Marusaki, who oversees sales of the metal. He declined to disclose the fee, which also includes delivery costs, or identify affected customers. “The increase is in line with a jump in U.S. premiums,” Marusaki said in an interview on March 8. Fees in the U.S. rose as prices of raw materials and scrap batteries jumped, while some producers also closed operations, tightening supply, he said. Buyers in the U.S. are paying 14 cents per pound more than the LME’s cash price for lead, according to Metal Bulletin Plc data. The premium in Europe this year almost doubled from 2012 to 100 euros ($130) to 150 euros a metric ton, four traders with direct knowledge of the sales said in January. Lead for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange fell 0.3 percent to $2,206.25 a ton at 4:51 p.m. Tokyo time, while zinc was down 0.3 percent at $1,969 a ton. Shares of Toho rose 0.3 percent to close at 390 yen today. Toho said in October that it would produce 92,000 tons of lead and 91,000 tons of zinc in the 12 months ending March 31. Marusaki said the target remained unchanged and that Toho would announce plans for the next half year in early April. The company shut its Chigirishima lead smelter in Hiroshima for 20 days for scheduled maintenance on March 3, Marusaki said. There are no plans to suspend operations at the Annaka and Onahama zinc smelters, which were halted for at least two months last year after Tokyo Electric Power Co. raised electricity rates for some big users by an average of 17 percent. The Annaka smelter has an annual capacity of 139,200 tons of zinc, according to the company. The Onahama plant processes two-thirds of the zinc concentrate required by the Annaka smelter.

(5707) , a Japanese non- ferrous metal smelter, said it raised fees on lead sales by 50 percent for the year starting in April, increasing costs for battery makers. The Tokyo-based company, which is Japan ’s biggest refiner of lead and second-biggest of zinc, pushed the surcharge buyers pay over the London Metal Exchange’s cash price for lead to the highest level in at least 20 years, said Kimiyasu Marusaki, who oversees sales of the metal. He declined to disclose the fee, which also includes delivery costs, or identify affected customers. “The increase is in line with a jump in U.S. premiums,” Marusaki said in an interview on March 8. Fees in the U.S. rose as prices of raw materials and scrap batteries jumped, while some producers also closed operations, tightening supply, he said. Buyers in the U.S. are paying 14 cents per pound more than the LME’s cash price for lead, according to Metal Bulletin Plc data. The premium in Europe this year almost doubled from 2012 to 100 euros ($130) to 150 euros a metric ton, four traders with direct knowledge of the sales said in January. Lead for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange fell 0.3 percent to $2,206.25 a ton at 4:51 p.m. Tokyo time, while zinc was down 0.3 percent at $1,969 a ton. Shares of Toho rose 0.3 percent to close at 390 yen today. Toho said in October that it would produce 92,000 tons of lead and 91,000 tons of zinc in the 12 months ending March 31. Marusaki said the target remained unchanged and that Toho would announce plans for the next half year in early April.

Cutout values are separated into three main product types. Fabricated loads are beef cuts taken from an animal's ribs, chuck, round, loin, brisket, short plate and flank; 50 percent loads are 50 percent lean beef trimmings. Ground loads may contain 73, 75, or 80 percent ground beef. A typical refrigerated truckload carries 40,000 pounds. Choice 1-3 grade is a better grade than Select 1-3, partly because Choice cuts have more fat, or marbling, than Select cuts. Grade quality is determined using a 1-5 yield grade scale. A rating of 1 is the highest ratio of muscle to fat, while 5 is the lowest.  Marbling is an important flavor factor.",['Michael Carone'],"USDA Boxed Beef Cutout Midday Prices for September 21 September 21 (Bloomberg) -- This table details boxed beef cutout prices supplied daily by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Cutout values are separated into three main product types. Fabricated loads are beef cuts taken from an animal's ribs, chuck, round, loin, brisket, short plate and flank; 50 percent loads are 50 percent lean beef trimmings. Ground loads may contain 73, 75, or 80 percent ground beef. A typical refrigerated truckload carries 40,000 pounds. Choice 1-3 grade is a better grade than Select 1-3, partly because Choice cuts have more fat, or marbling, than Select cuts. Grade quality is determined using a 1-5 yield grade scale. A rating of 1 is the highest ratio of muscle to fat, while 5 is the lowest.  Marbling is an important flavor factor.",11444,1520,261,87.98929456979917,16,4,False,38,9,3,True,False,5.7328947368421055,0,13,15,4,neutral,0.888751208782196,neutral,0.888751208782196,neutral,0.9258015155792236,Ground Beef Loin Blended Ground Beef,5,Emerging

Cameron Says Strengthening Economy May Allow U.K. to Lower Taxes,['Scott Hamilton'],2013-07-21 23:00:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-21/cameron-says-strengthening-economy-may-allow-u-k-to-lower-taxes.html,"U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said the British economy is “healing” and that the improvement should allow the government to lower taxes. “As we start to see the economy grow stronger -- and it is growing stronger -- as we start to see the country improve, actually I want to give people back some of their hard-earned money and try to reduce their taxes,” Cameron said in an interview on the BBC ’s “Andrew Marr Show” broadcast yesterday. “Your economy does better if you say to people you’ve worked hard, you’ve done the right thing, here is some of your own money back in a tax reduction.” With recent data showing strength in the economy, Cameron may find it easier to achieve his deficit-reduction goals as part of the biggest fiscal squeeze since World War II. Due to a weaker-than-expected recovery after the global financial crisis, Cameron’s Conservatives and their Liberal Democrat coalition partners have had to extend budget cuts until 2017-18, beyond the country’s next general election in 2015. The government’s fiscal plans show “further need for spending reductions in order to meet our deficit targets” and “don’t include any plans for tax rises,” Cameron said. The U.K. public has “set us this task of trying to turn the country round, sort out the deficit, get the economy moving again, build a country where hardworking people get rewarded,” Cameron said. “They’ll judge us in 2015 and I hope to persuade them that a Conservative-only government will be able to do even more of that.” Gaining Momentum After returning to growth in the first quarter, Britain’s economy has shown some signs of gaining momentum. Measures of services, manufacturing and construction all improved in June and recent reports have suggested rising house prices and falling unemployment are spurring consumer confidence. Data this week will probably show gross domestic product rose 0.6 percent in the second quarter, the most since 2012, compared with 0.3 percent in the previous three months, according to the median of 37 economist forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. The Office for National Statistics will publish the data, a first estimate, on July 25. Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne are counting on the economy gaining ground to boost support for the Conservative Party , also known as the Tories, which is trailing behind the opposition Labour Party in opinion polls. ‘Worse Off’ Cameron’s economic strategy hasn’t worked and Labour would raise the threshold at which people begin paying income tax, paid for by a mansion levy on the wealthiest, said lawmaker Catherine McKinnell, a spokeswoman for the opposition on Treasury issues. “The Tories have given millionaires a huge tax cut , but their decisions have made people on middle and low incomes worse off,” McKinnell said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. “The reason why there’s still going to be a big deficit after the next election is this government’s economic failure. That’s why the government should be acting now to secure the recovery and help families struggling with the cost-of-living crisis.” Cameron should break up the coalition next year so the Conservatives can campaign more clearly as a separate political party in the run-up to the general election, the Sunday Telegraph yesterday cited Conservative lawmakers Graham Brady and Bernard Jenkin as saying. “I want to govern as a Conservative-only government,” Cameron said yesterday. “I’m aiming for victory and I’m going to fight all-out for victory, and I think victory is achievable if we really roll up our sleeves and deliver.” Child Pornography The prime minister will give a speech today on tackling child pornography on the Internet. He said yesterday that Internet companies need to block the results of searches for child-abuse images, and that the government will look at bringing in legal controls should they fail to comply. “We need to have very, very strong conversations with those companies about saying ‘no, you shouldn’t provide results for some terms that are so depraved and disgusting,’” Cameron said. “If we don’t get what we need we’ll have to look at legislation.” On the conflict in Syria , Cameron said the U.K. is sticking with plans to give only non-lethal support to rebel forces. “I would accept that we’re on a depressing trajectory and we need to change that,” he said. “You’ve got an evil president who’s doing dreadful things to his people, I think he may be stronger than he was a few months ago, but I’d still describe the situation as a stalemate.” EU Ties Asked about his plans to renegotiate the U.K.’s relationship with the European Union before a proposed referendum in 2017 on Britain’s EU membership, Cameron said yesterday that more specific goals will be set out “over time.” He is seeking to repatriate some powers and streamline decision-making as part of an overhaul of the political bloc. “I go into these negotiations optimistic and confident that I can get a better deal for Britain,” he said. “I wouldn’t be going down this path if I didn’t think it was possible to get the result I want to achieve.” Japan told Britain it “expects that the U.K. will maintain a strong voice and continue to play a major role in the EU,” the Sunday Times said yesterday, citing a memo to the British government as part of an official review into the current arrangement.

Measures of services, manufacturing and construction all improved in June and recent reports have suggested rising house prices and falling unemployment are spurring consumer confidence. Data this week will probably show gross domestic product rose 0.6 percent in the second quarter, the most since 2012, compared with 0.3 percent in the previous three months, according to the median of 37 economist forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. The Office for National Statistics will publish the data, a first estimate, on July 25. Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne are counting on the economy gaining ground to boost support for the Conservative Party , also known as the Tories, which is trailing behind the opposition Labour Party in opinion polls. ‘Worse Off’ Cameron’s economic strategy hasn’t worked and Labour would raise the threshold at which people begin paying income tax, paid for by a mansion levy on the wealthiest, said lawmaker Catherine McKinnell, a spokeswoman for the opposition on Treasury issues. “The Tories have given millionaires a huge tax cut , but their decisions have made people on middle and low incomes worse off,” McKinnell said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. “The reason why there’s still going to be a big deficit after the next election is this government’s economic failure. That’s why the government should be acting now to secure the recovery and help families struggling with the cost-of-living crisis.” Cameron should break up the coalition next year so the Conservatives can campaign more clearly as a separate political party in the run-up to the general election, the Sunday Telegraph yesterday cited Conservative lawmakers Graham Brady and Bernard Jenkin as saying. “I want to govern as a Conservative-only government,” Cameron said yesterday. “I’m aiming for victory and I’m going to fight all-out for victory, and I think victory is achievable if we really roll up our sleeves and deliver.” Child Pornography The prime minister will give a speech today on tackling child pornography on the Internet. He said yesterday that Internet companies need to block the results of searches for child-abuse images, and that the government will look at bringing in legal controls should they fail to comply. “We need to have very, very strong conversations with those companies about saying ‘no, you shouldn’t provide results for some terms that are so depraved and disgusting,’” Cameron said. “If we don’t get what we need we’ll have to look at legislation.” On the conflict in Syria , Cameron said the U.K. is sticking with plans to give only non-lethal support to rebel forces. “I would accept that we’re on a depressing trajectory and we need to change that,” he said. “You’ve got an evil president who’s doing dreadful things to his people, I think he may be stronger than he was a few months ago, but I’d still describe the situation as a stalemate.” EU Ties Asked about his plans to renegotiate the U.K.’s relationship with the European Union before a proposed referendum in 2017 on Britain’s EU membership, Cameron said yesterday that more specific goals will be set out “over time.” He is seeking to repatriate some powers and streamline decision-making as part of an overhaul of the political bloc. “I go into these negotiations optimistic and confident that I can get a better deal for Britain,” he said. “I wouldn’t be going down this path if I didn’t think it was possible to get the result I want to achieve.” Japan told Britain it “expects that the U.K. will maintain a strong voice and continue to play a major role in the EU,” the Sunday Times said yesterday, citing a memo to the British government as part of an official review into the current arrangement.

Nuance Jumps After Investor Carl Icahn Reports 9.3% Holding,['James Callan' 'Olga Kharif'],2013-04-02 13:42:36,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/nuance-jumps-after-carl-icahn-reports-9-3-passive-stake.html,"Nuance Communications Inc. (NUAN) , a maker of speech-recognition software, rose the most in almost eight months after billionaire investor Carl Icahn disclosed a 9.3 percent passive stake in the company. The shares advanced 7.9 percent to $21.77 at 9:36 a.m. New York time after jumping as much as 8.5 percent, the biggest intraday gain since Aug. 8. Nuance, based in Burlington, Massachusetts, disclosed the stake in a regulatory filing yesterday. Icahn uses shareholdings to seek change in companies he deems undervalued or ill-managed. He has recently also focused on disrupting other parties’ investments, including Silver Lake Management LLC’s plan to take Dell Inc. (DELL) private. Nuance plunged the most in more than six years in February after cutting full- year sales and profit forecasts, citing shifting demand for software. Icahn may seek to break up the company, said Tom Roderick, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Chicago. “Any time you get an activist shareholder involved, the perception is, there’s something within the structure of the company they’d like to change,” Roderick said in an interview. “More value could be unlocked by selling pieces of the company.” Rebecca Paquette, a spokeswoman for Nuance, declined to comment. A message left outside regular business hours for a representative of Icahn wasn’t immediately returned. Nuance said in February that transcription volume is falling as health-industry customers shift to electronic medical records and its new Dragon Medical speech-to-text software.

Cutout values are separated into three main product types. Fabricated loads are beef cuts taken from an animal's ribs, chuck, round, loin, brisket, short plate and flank; 50 percent loads are 50 percent lean beef trimmings. Ground loads may contain 73, 75, or 80 percent ground beef. A typical refrigerated truckload carries 40,000 pounds. Choice 1-3 grade is a better grade than Select 1-3, partly because Choice cuts have more fat, or marbling, than Select cuts. Grade quality is determined using a 1-5 yield grade scale. A rating of 1 is the highest ratio of muscle to fat, while 5 is the lowest.  Marbling is an important flavor factor.",['Michael Carone'],"USDA Boxed Beef Cutout Midday Prices for September 19 September 19 (Bloomberg) -- This table details boxed beef cutout prices supplied daily by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Death of Jobs Leaves Hollywood Chiefs Without Trusted Silicon Valley Envoy,['Michael White' 'Ronald Grover' 'Andy Fixmer'],2011-10-07 06:30:58,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/steve-jobs-s-death-leaves-hollywood-without-trusted-silicon-valley-envoy.html,"Steve Jobs ’s death leaves Hollywood without the trusted technology envoy who helped push the film, TV and music industries into the digital age. In the 25 years after he bought George Lucas ’s digital animation business and renamed it Pixar, Jobs charmed, angered and cajoled Hollywood executives as he pursued his vision for digital entertainment. He clashed with former Walt Disney Co. (DIS) Chief Executive Officer Michael Eisner over their movie partnership, while befriending Eisner’s successor, Robert Iger. Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s co-founder relentlessly challenged the industry to change -- ushering in the age of digital animation with “Toy Story,” upending the record labels with the iPod and the iTunes store, and by negotiating to sell TV shows and films online. Disney’s ABC was the first to sign on. “Steve and I were talking for months about delivering TV shows on iTunes, which is when he shows me the video iPod, and I said, ‘We’re in!’” Iger said in e-mail. “Movies were next, a year later. It was about what we wanted to do and what we felt was right for our business.” With the 2006 sale of Pixar, Jobs became Burbank, California-based Disney’s biggest investor, with a stake worth $4.35 billion. Hollywood executives resisted putting shows online. Piracy had devastated the music industry and iTunes’ dominance of online music retailing gave Cupertino, California-based Apple unprecedented influence over the record labels. ‘Getting It’ Jobs was determined to get the studios on board, said Jim Gianopulos, co-chairman of News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox Filmed Entertainment. “He’d call up and say, ‘We’ve got to do this, this is the way to do it, and you guys aren’t getting it,’” Gianopulos said in an interview. “We would banter back and forth, but we always found ways to work together. To his great credit, he would see an aspect of the film side, the media side, that he hadn’t considered, and he would call back the next day and he would have figured out how to work that problem.” Today, iTunes is the top seller of online movies, with 66 percent of the market for electronic sales and Web video-on- demand, researcher IHS said in August. Its share of U.S. music retailing was 70 percent last year, according to NPD. “Steve understood that the only way to compete with piracy was to create a system that by its very nature is more convenient for consumers,” said Paul Vidich, a Warner Music Group Corp. (WMG) executive who negotiated the first record-label agreement with Apple. ‘Rocket Ship’ Diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer in 2003, Jobs died Oct. 5 at age 56. Gianopulos said his discussions with Jobs over film rights evolved into a personal friendship. “He would come into the meeting and say, ‘Hey, you want to see something cool?’ And he would reach into his jacket and pull out the first prototype of the iPhone,” Gianopulos said. “It was like someone had shown you the first rocket ship.” Disney, the pioneer in animation and theme parks, became a lab for Jobs. The studio served as distributor of Pixar movies starting in 1995. Later, after Jobs sold the animation studio to Disney for $8.06 billion in stock, the company became an Internet trailblazer as well -- becoming the first of its peers to offer films and TV shows on iTunes. Today former Pixar CEO Ed Catmull oversees all of Disney’s animation. John Lasseter, Pixar’s creative leader, holds a similar post at Disney with roles in films and theme parks. Clash With Eisner Relations with Disney almost foundered in 2003 in a dispute with Eisner over an extension of the Pixar deal, and on Jan. 30, 2004, Jobs announced Pixar was looking elsewhere. In nine years, the partnership had produced some of Disney’s top-grossing pictures, such as “Finding Nemo.” By that time, Eisner’s position at Disney was shaky. His pay and flagging stock angered institutional investors and Roy Disney, nephew of founder Walt and an influential shareholder. Iger was named to succeed Eisner in March 2005 and the first call was with Jobs. “He wished me well and hoped we could work together soon,” Iger said in a 2005 interview with Businessweek. In October, within two weeks of taking over, Iger agreed to sell episodes of TV shows from Disney’s ABC network on iTunes for $1.99 each. Three months later, he clinched the deal for Pixar. Pixar’s 12 movies have generated $5.73 billion in worldwide box office sales for Disney and theater operators, according to Box Office Mojo, a movie-tracking service. They’ve become theme- park attractions and a “Cars” land will open at Disney’s California Adventure next year. ‘Pretty Simple’ The entertainment industry is still grappling with how to prosper in the digital world Jobs helped create. In August, after a year-long experiment, Apple ended its 99-cent rentals of TV episodes from Fox and ABC. CBS Corp. (CBS) , owner of the most-watched U.S. TV network, and NBC didn’t participate because the price was too low. After first caving in to Jobs’s demands that all songs sell for 99 cents, the music industry last year won more control over pricing on iTunes, pushing through a 30-cent increase in the price of some tracks. Music executives credit Jobs with saving the industry from Internet piracy. “The guy had been doing serious thinking while we were all batting our heads against a wall,” Jimmy Iovine , chairman of Interscope-Geffen-A&M, said in a 2004 interview. “He was going to provide us with that great interface and we were going to give him unique content that you couldn’t get anywhere else.

Political Gridlock Leaves U.S. Facing Cyber Pearl Harbor,['Eric Engleman' 'Michael Riley'],2012-11-15 05:45:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/political-gridlock-leaves-u-s-facing-cyber-pearl-harbor.html,"There’s almost universal agreement that the U.S. faces a catastrophic threat from cyber attacks by terrorists, hackers and spies. Washington policy makers just don’t seem able to do anything about it. Even with the consensus about vulnerabilities in U.S. networks, and with hundreds of billions of dollars at stake, Congress failed to pass cybersecurity legislation that was four years in the making and had sponsors from both parties. The measure succumbed in August amid partisan gridlock and aggressive lobbying, even though lawmakers had heard warnings for years about holes in corporate and government systems that imperil U.S economic and national security. “Based on my experience, very few people on the Hill get this,” said Shawn Henry, who stepped down as executive assistant director of the FBI in April. “You can’t see it, touch it or taste it, so it’s somehow not real.” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat, yesterday failed to muster enough votes to revive the measure. The bill’s demise reveals how partisan bickering, tactical errors, industry lobbying, conflicting interests, and ignorance can trump even national security concerns, according to documents and interviews with advocates and opponents in the Senate, the administration and the business community. The legislation’s collapse leaves President Barack Obama with few options, administration officials said in interviews. One possibility officials have discussed is an executive order aimed at achieving some of what the legislation could have done to shore up private-sector networks. Obama Directive Last month, Obama signed a separate cybersecurity directive authorizing the National Security Agency and other military units to take more aggressive action to defeat attacks on government and private computer systems. An Oct. 4 Bloomberg Government study by Afzal Bari and Jason Wilson concluded that any future order from Obama likely would promote almost real-time monitoring of crucial systems, which “may require companies to provide network information through systems connected to the federal government.” “We are still going to need legislation to do the things that we think need to be done,” White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Michael Daniel said in an interview. “An executive order is not an adequate substitute.” All sides concede that they made mistakes that contributed to the failure of the bill. The Senate measure was championed by Senators Joseph Lieberman , a Connecticut independent who is retiring, and Susan Collins , a Maine Republican. Senate Bill The White House focused its efforts on a gridlocked Senate rather than on the Republican-controlled House, which had passed several less ambitious cybersecurity bills. Congressional Democrats sought to give the Department of Homeland Security ill-defined powers to set new cybersecurity standards and failed to come up with credible estimates of what those standards would cost. Many Senate Republicans took their cues from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and businesses that framed the debate not as a matter of national security, but rather as a battle between free enterprise and an overreaching government, according to documents and descriptions of lobbying efforts. The Senate bill “would have created a new bureaucracy that would have slowed down the process and forced companies to focus on compliance with new government mandates that would not insure better and faster notifications of cyber threats,” Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas , the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee who also is retiring, said in an e-mail. Liability Suits Many companies also feared that regulation would expose them to a greater risk of shareholder liability suits in the event of an attack, an issue compounded by the fact that it’s easier to estimate the cost of stiffer defenses than to guess the price of a possible attack, said congressional aides who worked on the Lieberman-Collins bill and discussed it on condition of anonymity. Add to those uncertainties the fact that no bill can offer perfect protection, said the White House’s Daniel. “Currently, bad actors don’t have to be sophisticated to cause significant consequences,” he said. “We want the bad actors to not be able to succeed as easily,” even though that’s “not going to stop them from trying.” The latest warning about the peril of terrorist-led cyber attacks came yesterday from the National Academy of Sciences , which cautioned in a report that an assault on the U.S. power grid could leave millions of people in the dark for months and cause billions of dollars in damage. Latest Warning The report is the latest in a long string of alarms about the vulnerability of the nation’s Internet backbone, underscored by constant probes and attacks on government, banking and other computer networks. The next attack, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in an Oct. 11 speech, could derail passenger trains, spill toxic chemicals or cause widespread blackouts. “The collective result of these kinds of attacks could be a cyber Pearl Harbor; an attack that would cause physical destruction and the loss of life,” Panetta said. “In fact, it would paralyze and shock the nation.” Congress’s failure to pass a cybersecurity bill has left the U.S. unprepared and ill-equipped to cope with an Internet assault on the computer networks that control much of the nation’s physical and financial nervous system, Panetta said. Almost from the beginning, though, congressional aides said in interviews, the Lieberman-Collins bill was hampered by the secrecy that blankets government cyber programs and the difficulty in grasping the technology behind attacks and defenses. Only a handful of lawmakers understood the threat, people who briefed them regularly said. Simulated Attack The government’s top cybersecurity officials staged a classified demonstration for dozens of senators in March in an effort to change that. They simulated a cyber attack that paralyzed New York City’s power grid, causing multiple deaths and billions of dollars in damage, two officials said. While government researchers had identified a vulnerability in the nation’s electrical grid years ago, lawmakers said during a congressional hearing in 2008 that no U.S. or state agency could compel power companies to act. “That was really the key moment,” said Jacob Olcott, a former Democratic staffer on the Senate Commerce Committee and a cybersecurity specialist. “That’s when we realized that there was a gap in the existing regulatory authority, and the private sector was doing little to improve security on its own.” DHS Targeted The bill Lieberman and Collins introduced in February granted that authority to the Homeland Security Department, which handles civilian cybersecurity issues. The choice of DHS, already under fire for its airport-screening procedures, was an immediate target for Republicans. Under the bill, DHS would regulate computer systems that could cause mass casualties or significant economic damage if they were manipulated or destroyed. Those vulnerable points would be identified by a public-private review process. In interviews, several Republican aides said the review process could take years, and the bill would leave DHS free to define the limits of its own power. “When before have we given an agency regulatory authority without defining who would be regulated?” said Brian Rogers , a spokesman for Senator John McCain , an Arizona Republican. Another business concern, echoed by Senate Republicans, was that making DHS the switchboard for exchanging threat reports would disrupt existing information-sharing arrangements, for example between defense and technology firms and the NSA. Business Opposition Advocates of new federal standards found themselves facing opponents that included the Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest business lobby, AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , as well as energy companies and electric utilities. Private industry, business lobbyists argued, could adapt to changing cyber threats faster than government could, and new federal standards would curb their freedom to innovate. The Lieberman-Collins bill’s proposed standards also were so vague, Senate Republican staffers said, that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was unable to score the legislation. “Until someone can argue both the national security and the economic parts of it, you’re going to have these dividing forces,” Melissa Hathaway, a White House cyber official in the Bush and Obama administrations who left in 2009, said in an interview. “Most likely, big industry is going to win because at the end of the day our economy is still in trouble.” Situation Room Administration officials brought Senate staffers from both parties to the White House Situation Room for cybersecurity briefings in 2011. The goal, said an official familiar with the effort, was to create a sense of urgency in the room where the president had monitored the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. By this summer, though, business and Republican opposition to new federal standards had hardened. With weeks to go before the Senate’s summer recess, the measure’s sponsors diluted their proposal on July 19 to attract more Republican support. The revised bill made infrastructure standards voluntary and offered incentives such as liability protection and expedited government security clearances. The new standards would be overseen not by DHS but by a multi-agency council. Responding to criticism from privacy and civil-liberties advocates, though, the new bill still put DHS, a civilian agency, in charge of the information-sharing provisions. The compromise didn’t win a single Republican vote. “The lobbyists smelled blood in the water,” said Olcott, now a principal at Good Harbor Consulting LLC, a security-risk firm based in Arlington, Virginia. Last-Ditch Appeal The administration then called up the troops to make a last-ditch appeal to Republicans. Army General Keith Alexander, the head of the NSA, which helps guard the government’s computer networks, told lawmakers on July 30 that the U.S. had evidence that adversaries have penetrated civilian networks. He compared the moment to 1993, the year of the first World Trade Center bombing, which was a precursor to Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “They’re practicing,” Alexander said. His warning shook many of the lawmakers, while opponents’ remained determined to kill the measure. The next day, July 31, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , a Kentucky Republican, signaled that Republicans weren’t even planning to debate the bill. Instead, their first amendment to it would repeal Obama’s health-care overhaul. Republicans seeking a compromise took one last shot. In a tense meeting between the Chamber of Commerce and a group of senators on Aug. 1, the day before the scheduled vote, Indiana Republican Dan Coats argued that legislators had to be open- minded and flexible, according one eyewitness. Bruce Josten , the chief lobbyist for the Chamber, cut Coats off and dismissed similar comments by Lieberman, attendees said. The Chamber doesn’t discuss private meetings with members and legislators, spokeswoman Jamie Glick said in an e-mail. On Aug. 2, Senate Republican national security hawks, including McCain and Hutchison, all voted to block the bill.

Many Senate Republicans took their cues from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and businesses that framed the debate not as a matter of national security, but rather as a battle between free enterprise and an overreaching government, according to documents and descriptions of lobbying efforts. The Senate bill “would have created a new bureaucracy that would have slowed down the process and forced companies to focus on compliance with new government mandates that would not insure better and faster notifications of cyber threats,” Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas , the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee who also is retiring, said in an e-mail. Liability Suits Many companies also feared that regulation would expose them to a greater risk of shareholder liability suits in the event of an attack, an issue compounded by the fact that it’s easier to estimate the cost of stiffer defenses than to guess the price of a possible attack, said congressional aides who worked on the Lieberman-Collins bill and discussed it on condition of anonymity. Add to those uncertainties the fact that no bill can offer perfect protection, said the White House’s Daniel. “Currently, bad actors don’t have to be sophisticated to cause significant consequences,” he said. “We want the bad actors to not be able to succeed as easily,” even though that’s “not going to stop them from trying.” The latest warning about the peril of terrorist-led cyber attacks came yesterday from the National Academy of Sciences , which cautioned in a report that an assault on the U.S. power grid could leave millions of people in the dark for months and cause billions of dollars in damage. Latest Warning The report is the latest in a long string of alarms about the vulnerability of the nation’s Internet backbone, underscored by constant probes and attacks on government, banking and other computer networks. The next attack, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in an Oct. 11 speech, could derail passenger trains, spill toxic chemicals or cause widespread blackouts. “The collective result of these kinds of attacks could be a cyber Pearl Harbor; an attack that would cause physical destruction and the loss of life,” Panetta said. “In fact, it would paralyze and shock the nation.” Congress’s failure to pass a cybersecurity bill has left the U.S. unprepared and ill-equipped to cope with an Internet assault on the computer networks that control much of the nation’s physical and financial nervous system, Panetta said. Almost from the beginning, though, congressional aides said in interviews, the Lieberman-Collins bill was hampered by the secrecy that blankets government cyber programs and the difficulty in grasping the technology behind attacks and defenses. Only a handful of lawmakers understood the threat, people who briefed them regularly said. Simulated Attack The government’s top cybersecurity officials staged a classified demonstration for dozens of senators in March in an effort to change that. They simulated a cyber attack that paralyzed New York City’s power grid, causing multiple deaths and billions of dollars in damage, two officials said. While government researchers had identified a vulnerability in the nation’s electrical grid years ago, lawmakers said during a congressional hearing in 2008 that no U.S. or state agency could compel power companies to act. “That was really the key moment,” said Jacob Olcott, a former Democratic staffer on the Senate Commerce Committee and a cybersecurity specialist. “That’s when we realized that there was a gap in the existing regulatory authority, and the private sector was doing little to improve security on its own.” DHS Targeted The bill Lieberman and Collins introduced in February granted that authority to the Homeland Security Department, which handles civilian cybersecurity issues. The choice of DHS, already under fire for its airport-screening procedures, was an immediate target for Republicans. Under the bill, DHS would regulate computer systems that could cause mass casualties or significant economic damage if they were manipulated or destroyed. Those vulnerable points would be identified by a public-private review process. In interviews, several Republican aides said the review process could take years, and the bill would leave DHS free to define the limits of its own power. “When before have we given an agency regulatory authority without defining who would be regulated?” said Brian Rogers , a spokesman for Senator John McCain , an Arizona Republican. Another business concern, echoed by Senate Republicans, was that making DHS the switchboard for exchanging threat reports would disrupt existing information-sharing arrangements, for example between defense and technology firms and the NSA. Business Opposition Advocates of new federal standards found themselves facing opponents that included the Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest business lobby, AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , as well as energy companies and electric utilities. Private industry, business lobbyists argued, could adapt to changing cyber threats faster than government could, and new federal standards would curb their freedom to innovate. The Lieberman-Collins bill’s proposed standards also were so vague, Senate Republican staffers said, that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was unable to score the legislation. “Until someone can argue both the national security and the economic parts of it, you’re going to have these dividing forces,” Melissa Hathaway, a White House cyber official in the Bush and Obama administrations who left in 2009, said in an interview. “Most likely, big industry is going to win because at the end of the day our economy is still in trouble.” Situation Room Administration officials brought Senate staffers from both parties to the White House Situation Room for cybersecurity briefings in 2011. The goal, said an official familiar with the effort, was to create a sense of urgency in the room where the president had monitored the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. By this summer, though, business and Republican opposition to new federal standards had hardened. With weeks to go before the Senate’s summer recess, the measure’s sponsors diluted their proposal on July 19 to attract more Republican support. The revised bill made infrastructure standards voluntary and offered incentives such as liability protection and expedited government security clearances. The new standards would be overseen not by DHS but by a multi-agency council. Responding to criticism from privacy and civil-liberties advocates, though, the new bill still put DHS, a civilian agency, in charge of the information-sharing provisions. The compromise didn’t win a single Republican vote. “The lobbyists smelled blood in the water,” said Olcott, now a principal at Good Harbor Consulting LLC, a security-risk firm based in Arlington, Virginia. Last-Ditch Appeal The administration then called up the troops to make a last-ditch appeal to Republicans. Army General Keith Alexander, the head of the NSA, which helps guard the government’s computer networks, told lawmakers on July 30 that the U.S. had evidence that adversaries have penetrated civilian networks. He compared the moment to 1993, the year of the first World Trade Center bombing, which was a precursor to Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “They’re practicing,” Alexander said. His warning shook many of the lawmakers, while opponents’ remained determined to kill the measure. The next day, July 31, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , a Kentucky Republican, signaled that Republicans weren’t even planning to debate the bill. Instead, their first amendment to it would repeal Obama’s health-care overhaul. Republicans seeking a compromise took one last shot. In a tense meeting between the Chamber of Commerce and a group of senators on Aug. 1, the day before the scheduled vote, Indiana Republican Dan Coats argued that legislators had to be open- minded and flexible, according one eyewitness. Bruce Josten , the chief lobbyist for the Chamber, cut Coats off and dismissed similar comments by Lieberman, attendees said. The Chamber doesn’t discuss private meetings with members and legislators, spokeswoman Jamie Glick said in an e-mail. On Aug. 2, Senate Republican national security hawks, including McCain and Hutchison, all voted to block the bill.

Obama Says Martin Case Calls for ‘Soul Searching’ on Race,['Roger Runningen' 'Mike Dorning'],2013-07-20 00:26:45,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/obama-says-trayvon-martin-case-triggered-pain-for-u-s-blacks.html,"President Barack Obama , whose election was celebrated as a repudiation of racial prejudice, asked the nation for a “soul searching” examination of race relations in the wake of Trayvon Martin’s shooting death. “Trayvon Martin could have been me,” Obama said yesterday during a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room to offer his first public remarks about the case since a Florida jury acquitted the man who fatally shot the black teenager. The president explained in personal terms his reaction to the shooting of the 17-year-old by a Florida neighborhood watch volunteer, underscoring from the most powerful office in the land a vulnerability many black Americans feel to racial profiling and violence -- no matter the status they achieve. “There are very few African-American men in this country who haven’t had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store,” Obama said. “That includes me.” Though Obama’s life story as the son of a white mother and a black father was central to his rise and a speech on race relations was a turning point in his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, he has rarely addressed the topic in office. In this instance, Obama went well beyond the familiar role of a president expressing national sympathy. “It’s very unusual for a president to identify with a victim like this,” said Allan J. Lichtman, a political history professor at American University in Washington. “By personalizing it to such an extent, he really has made an important symbolic and emotional statement.” Personal Impact The image of a president or his children as potential victims of violence could have a “big impact” in fueling a national conversation on the challenges young blacks continue to face, Lichtman said. Obama said Martin’s death provoked “a lot of pain” among blacks because it reminded many that they have been the targets of suspicion and vulnerable to violence. He said he wanted to discuss the context of protests spurred by the verdict and about ways to move ahead “in a positive direction.” Martin, 17, was shot in February 2012 in Sanford, Florida , by George Zimmerman, who followed him and reported to police that the teenager was acting suspiciously. Martin was returning from a convenience store. Zimmerman, who was legally carrying a firearm, told police that when he got out of his truck he was confronted and punched by Martin, and shot him in self defense. He was acquitted of a second-degree murder charge. Legal Case Obama declined to comment on the legal case, saying he would leave that to “all the legal analysts and talking heads.” He said the trial was conducted professionally and the jury instructed properly. “Once the jury has spoken, that’s how our system works.” With the prospect of more protests over the verdict today, Obama said any violence “dishonors what happened to Trayvon Martin and his family.” While Attorney General Eric Holder is reviewing the case for possible criminal civil rights violations on the part of Zimmerman, Obama said “it’s important for people to have some clear expectations here.” The matter mostly involves issues of the criminal code and law enforcement at the state and local level, rather than the federal government, he said. Training, Laws Obama said the U.S. can do more to help train state and local police to reduce mistrust in minority communities. He also said it would be “useful” to examine state and local laws that “may encourage” violent confrontations, such as the one that left Martin dead. While Florida’s “stand your ground” law wasn’t used by Zimmerman’s defense in the trial, Obama said such statutes, implemented in whole or part in at least 30 states, may increase the likelihood that someone who is armed would use a gun rather than retreat from a threatening situation. Obama asked whether Martin would have been freed if he had been legally armed and shot Zimmerman because he felt threatened after being followed. “Do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened?” Obama said. “And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, then it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws.” Local Jurisdiction Such laws, and most law enforcement, are under the jurisdiction of state and local governments and Obama acknowledged the administration’s efforts may be limited primarily to limited to trying to shift public opinion. The president said he’s thinking about “some long-term project” in the future aimed largely at young black males, who are often swept up in violence and who “need a lot of help” because all they get is “negative reinforcement.” “Is there more that we can do to give them the sense that their country cares about them and values them and is willing to invest in them?” he said, adding that he is “not naïve” about the prospects of federal program making such changes. “I think it’s going to be important for all of us to do some soul-searching,” about race, he said, adding that it should be done at the level of family, church and workplace. While race still plays a role in many of society’s interactions, he said, the situation has gotten better in the U.S. as each generation makes progress in changing attitudes regarding race. Making Progress “It doesn’t mean that racism is eliminated,” he said. “But, when I talk to Malia and Sasha and I listen to their friends and I see them interact, they’re better than we are -- they’re better than we were -- on these issues. And that’s true in every community that I’ve visited all across the country.” Obama has frequently found himself in the center of the country’s thorniest racial issues. As a candidate in 2008, he gave a speech on race that decried the “racial stalemate” the country has been “stuck in for years.” He sparked a controversy during his first year in office when he declared on national television that the Cambridge, Massachusetts police had “acted stupidly” when they arrested black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates. Jr. He later calmed tensions by inviting Gates and the police officer for a “beer summit” on the Rose Garden patio. In mostly steering clear of explicitly racial issue during his presidency, Obama is following the same path as John F. Kennedy , the only Catholic president, who avoided sectarian religious issues in the White House after addressing anti-Catholicism in a campaign-year speech, Lichtman said. When he first addressed the death of Trayvon Martin last year, Obama spoke passionately about the killed 17-year-old. “If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon,” Obama said in March 2012. “When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.” He recalled that reaction today. “Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,” he said.

Polish Central Bank Sees 2014 Growth Recovery on Low Rate,['Piotr Skolimowski'],2013-03-11 11:47:56,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/polish-central-bank-sees-2014-growth-recovery-on-low-rate.html,"The Polish central bank raised its 2014 growth outlook on expectations record-low interest rates will help the economy recover from its worst slump in 12 years. The Warsaw-based Narodowy Bank Polski increased its forecast for gross domestic product next year to 2.6 percent from 2.3 percent seen in November, according to its March staff projection released today. The economy will expand 1.3 percent this year, the worst performance since 2001, according to the e- mailed document. Policy makers cut the main interest rate by 50 basis points, more than economists forecast, last week as consumer spending plunged and the euro-area recession curbed exports. The central bank will pause now after five reductions since November took Poland ’s benchmark to 3.25 percent, Governor Marek Belka said March 6. “We are going to see some impact from the rate cuts toward the end of this year,” Jacek Kotlowski, director at the central bank’s Economic Institute, said at a news conference in Warsaw. “We should see a recovery more clearly in 2014.” The central bank’s 10 policy makers received the projection before last week’s rate reduction. Their previous four quarter- point cuts will add 0.4 percentage points to economic growth, according to Kotlowski. It takes four to six quarters for the impact of reductions to filter through to the economy, he said. ‘Acceptable’ Rates The current level of borrowing costs is “acceptable” and the central bank is “almost” at the end of cuts, policy maker Elzbieta Chojna-Duch told PAP newswire in an interview today. The economic growth rate will remain “relatively low” in the next two years, she was quoted as saying. Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski today renewed calls for more monetary stimulus, saying he hoped the central bank will continue reductions after a “short break, perhaps a month.” Poland has Europe ’s third-highest real interest rates, he told Tok FM radio in an interview.

"Thai Baht, Bonds Fall This Week as Bill Sparks Political Concern",['Yumi Teso'],2013-07-26 08:38:59,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/thai-baht-bonds-fall-this-week-as-bill-sparks-political-concern.html,"Thailand ’s baht, government bonds and stocks dropped this week on concern the ruling coalition’s plan to push forward an amnesty bill for political protesters will trigger renewed tension. The benchmark SET Index (SET) of shares fell by the most in six weeks yesterday and slumped 1.8 percent from July 19 after the leader of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra’s Pheu Thai Party said late July 24 that a bill to pardon all wrongdoings in past political demonstrations will be tabled in August, according to the party’s website. Exports fell 3.4 percent in June from a year earlier, following a 5.3 percent decline in May, official data showed today, amid concern an economic slowdown in China will hurt overseas sales. “While sentiment is not so strong, any concern with regard to the political situation hurts the baht and Thai assets,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist covering emerging markets at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in Tokyo. “China slowdown concern is lingering and from the export perspective, it’s negative for the region.” The baht fell 0.2 percent this week to 31.1 per dollar as of 3:33 p.m. in Bangkok and touched a one-week low of 31.17 earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was unchanged today after declining 0.5 percent yesterday. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, dropped 34 basis points this week to 6.38 percent. New Bill The proposed bill would pardon those involved in demonstrations, mainly supporters of the current government, after former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was toppled in a 2006 coup. Thaksin is Yingluck’s brother. The bill is negative for stocks and could lead to another round of demonstrations, according to a DBS Vickers research note released yesterday. The drop in exports compared with the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey for a 1.6 percent increase. A Purchasing Managers Index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics this week showed a preliminary reading for Chinese factory output of 47.7 in July, compared with a forecast for 48.2. China took 11 percent of Thai exports in the first half of 2013 and shipments to Asia’s largest economy slumped 17 percent in June, official data show. The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds due June 2023 increased 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, this week to 3.87 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate, which was steady today, was the highest since June 26.

Exports fell 3.4 percent in June from a year earlier, following a 5.3 percent decline in May, official data showed today, amid concern an economic slowdown in China will hurt overseas sales. “While sentiment is not so strong, any concern with regard to the political situation hurts the baht and Thai assets,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist covering emerging markets at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in Tokyo. “China slowdown concern is lingering and from the export perspective, it’s negative for the region.” The baht fell 0.2 percent this week to 31.1 per dollar as of 3:33 p.m. in Bangkok and touched a one-week low of 31.17 earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was unchanged today after declining 0.5 percent yesterday. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, dropped 34 basis points this week to 6.38 percent. New Bill The proposed bill would pardon those involved in demonstrations, mainly supporters of the current government, after former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was toppled in a 2006 coup. Thaksin is Yingluck’s brother. The bill is negative for stocks and could lead to another round of demonstrations, according to a DBS Vickers research note released yesterday. The drop in exports compared with the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey for a 1.6 percent increase. A Purchasing Managers Index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics this week showed a preliminary reading for Chinese factory output of 47.7 in July, compared with a forecast for 48.2. China took 11 percent of Thai exports in the first half of 2013 and shipments to Asia’s largest economy slumped 17 percent in June, official data show. The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds due June 2023 increased 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, this week to 3.87 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate, which was steady today, was the highest since June 26.

Keppel Seeks New Non-Rig Orders for Brazil Yards: Southeast Asia,['Kenneth Foo' 'Kyunghee Park'],2013-07-22 10:08:51,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-21/keppel-seeks-new-non-rig-orders-for-brazil-yards-southeast-asia.html,"Keppel Corp. (KEP) , the world’s largest oil-rig maker, will focus on building more offshore production and support vessels in Brazil as competition from China cuts prices for its main product. Brazil’s offshore development boom means Keppel’s yard is now mainly utilized for building rigs for state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA. The Singapore-based company is setting up a second yard to meet demand for other vessels and to offer repair and conversion work, Chief Executive Officer Choo Chiau Beng said in an interview on July 19. “We’re not interested to take a lot more work than the six semis from Petrobras because we do not want to overload our shipyard,” Choo said, referring to an order to build semi-submersible rigs for state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA. “We want to leave some capacity for our other customers” who need floating production, storage and offloading platforms, or FPSOs, and for oil-rig repairs, he said. Demand for offshore drilling and production units is expected to increase as Brazil competes for investments at a time when producers are using new technologies to extract crude from shale beds across the U.S. and explorers are expanding activity off the coast of Africa. South America ’s largest economy targets to double its crude production by 2020. “The next big story there will be FPSOs because ultimately after you drill and discover oil, you’ll need FPSOs to produce it,” Vincent Fernando, the head of Asean research at Religare in Singapore, said in a phone interview on July 19. “They are looking at all the different ways they can tap the energy value chain, they don’t only need to build rigs.” Ramping Up Keppel signed a $4.1 billion order in August to build five semi-submersible rigs for Sete Brasil Participacoes SA, an affiliate of Petrobras. The state oil producer, which is developing the largest oil discovery in the Americas in three decades off the country’s coast, is spending $236.5 billion as part of its five-year investment plan. Choo said the company is in the process of ramping up production at its Brazilian yard specializing in offshore support vessels. Keppel had orders amounting to S$13.1 billion ($10 billion) as of June, with deliveries stretching into 2019. Shares of Keppel climbed 0.5 percent to S$10.80 at the close in Singapore, the biggest increase in a week. Property Fund Keppel is also diversifying other businesses. Alpha Investment Partners, Keppel’s real estate investment manager, closed its fund after raising $1.65 billion from investors that include pensions and sovereign wealth funds in South Korea , Abu Dhabi , Brunei and the Netherlands, Choo said. While Keppel is facing competition from yards in China for offshore projects, Choo expects customers to lay more emphasis on having products delivered on time. Clients had been asking Keppel to complete rigs that the Chinese yards were unable to finish, he said. “Chinese yards were desperate because they ran out of conventional ships to build,” Choo said. “They were offering crazy terms to attract customers.” China, the world’s biggest shipbuilding nation, may see a third of its yards shut down in about five years amid a global vessel glut, according to the China Association of National Shipbuilding Industry. That has prompted yards to expand into building offshore projects. Choo, 65, will retire at the end of this year and Chief Financial Officer Loh Chin Hua, who used to run Alpha, will take over from January.

Romanee-Conti Leads Zachys New York Auction With Jayer,['Guy Collins'],2013-03-16 00:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-16/romanee-conti-leads-zachys-new-york-auction-with-jayer.html,"Top Burgundies including Romanee- Conti, Cros Parantoux and La Tache led bidding at a Zachys wine auction in New York this month amid demand for rare vintages from collectors and investors in the U.S. and Hong Kong. A six-liter Methuselah of Romanee-Conti 1990 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti fetched $171,500 at the two-day sale ended March 8, while a case of Vosne-Romanee Cros Parantoux Henri Jayer 1997 sold for $39,200 and a three-liter jeroboam of La Tache Domaine de la Romanee-Conti went under the hammer for $29,400. The sale came after Burgundy wines also led auctions held by Acker Merrall & Condit in New York and Christie’s International Plc online last month. While the broader wine market has rebounded since December, demand has focused more on rarer Burgundies as Asian collectors sought to diversify away from heavily-traded Bordeaux labels. The London-based Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index rose 2.9 percent in February, its third straight monthly gain. “We saw an increased presence of people from Hong Kong , definitely more than last year,” Julia Gilbert, auction director at Zachys, said in a telephone interview. “I think that’s going to continue.” Three bottles of Romanee-Conti DRC 2008 and a separate three-bottle lot of the same producer’s 2006 vintage both sold for $26,950 each, according to an e-mail from Zachys. Six magnums of Bonnes Mares Georges Roumier 1999 fetched $18,375, beating the auction house ’s presale estimate, while a six-bottle lot of white Corton Charlemagne Coche-Dury 2005 also went under the hammer for the same price. Burgundy Outlook Other lots included a magnum of Musigny Vieilles Vignes Comte Georges de Vogue 1947, which sold for $10,413, and six bottles of La Tache DRC 2002 which went under the hammer for $11,025. Among top Burgundies sold at recent auctions around the world, six bottles of white Montrachet 1993 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti fetched the top price at a Sotheby’s wine sale in London on Feb. 27, selling for 21,150 pounds ($32,060) and matching the auction house’s high estimate. While demand for Burgundy remains strong at auctions around the world, some wine investors are cautious about the outlook. “We’ve seen Burgundy prices rise,” Chris Smith , investment manager at The Wine Investment Fund in London, said. “I would be worried about the risk profile.” The fund, which has about $50 million under management, is currently invested purely in Bordeaux, partly because the larger wine production from that region’s estates makes them easier to trade. Auction Demand Acker Merrall & Condit sold a three-bottle lot of Romanee Conti 2006 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti for $27,060 at a New York sale on Feb. 23, along with 12 bottles of Leroy Romanee-Saint- Vivant 1962 for $24,600 and Rousseau Chambertin Clos de Beze 1990 for $18,450. Christie’s sold a case of Montrachet 1988 DRC for $33,880 at a February online auction, with two bottles of the 1985 vintage fetching $7,260, while two 12-bottle Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Assortment cases from 1999 sold for 28,200 pounds each at Sotheby’s (BID) in London on Jan. 30.

"U.S. Stocks Fall on Wal-Mart Forecast, Budget Debate",['Nikolaj Gammeltoft'],2012-11-15 22:12:47,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/u-s-stock-futures-gain-after-s-p-500-sinks-to-july-low.html,"U.S. stocks fell, after the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped to the lowest level since June yesterday, as Wal-Mart (WMT) Stores Inc. forecast earnings that missed estimates and lawmakers prepared for budget talks. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. slid 3.6 percent as the world’s largest retailer forecast earnings that missed estimates. Phone stocks and utilities slumped the most in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, slipping more than 0.6 percent. Viacom Inc. (VIAB) increased 2.6 percent after the media company’s earnings topped analyst estimates. NetApp Inc. jumped 11 percent as profit for the second quarter beat forecasts. The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 1,353.33 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow lost 28.57 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,542.38. Volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was 7.28 billion shares today, 20 percent above the three-month daily average. “Wal-Mart is probably the best economic indicator today,” Richard Sichel , who oversees about $1.8 billion as chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co., said in a phone interview. “We have the daily drumbeat from Washington with investors watching, waiting and hoping that something will be resolved on the budget and enough progress will be made to take us to the end of the year without too much volatility.” Political Showdown The S&P 500 dropped to the lowest level since July 25 yesterday amid concern about the so-called fiscal cliff debate in Washington and an Israeli air strike on Gaza. The benchmark index has retreated 5.3 percent since President Barack Obama ’s re-election set up a budget showdown with the Republican- controlled House of Representatives. The gauge is trading below its average price for the past 200 days , and has lost 7.7 percent from an almost five-year high on Sept. 14. Obama is negotiating to reach a deficit-reduction deal with Congress to avert $607 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts. He will sit down with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders tomorrow for an opening round of negotiations. About 90 percent of the drop in the S&P 500 since Election Day “can be attributed to concerns about the U.S. fiscal cliff,” Marko Kolanovic, global head of derivatives and quantitative strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, wrote in a report today. More swings today may be because derivatives tied to the equity market expire tomorrow. Concerns about Washington gridlock overlap with tomorrow’s expiration for options contracts tied to underlying stocks, which “could cause high intraday volatility” as investors and traders buy and sell both derivatives and shares to adjust their positions, Kolanovic said in his analysis. Missile Attack Equities also fell as Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak signaled that Israel is ready to escalate its military operations against Gaza after at least one long-range missile was fired at Tel Aviv by Palestinian militants. Israel yesterday began a military operation termed Pillar of Defense against militants in the Gaza Strip. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index decreased to minus 10.7 in November from 5.7 a month earlier. A reading of zero is the dividing line between expansion and contraction in the area covering eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware. A separate report showed manufacturing in the New York region contracted for a fourth straight month in November as superstorm Sandy knocked out electrical power and limited activity. Applications for jobless benefits surged by 78,000 to 439,000 in the week ended Nov. 10, the most since April 2011, the Labor Department said. Several states said the increase was due to Sandy, a Labor Department spokesman said. ‘Mixed Bag’ “The economic reports were a mixed bag today, but the market probably doesn’t care about that at the moment,” James Gaul, a portfolio manager at Boston Advisors LLC which oversees about $2.3 billion in assets, said in a phone interview. “We had a steep decline since October and the question is whether we can stabilize here around the 1,350 to 1,358 level. If that happens then we may have a snap-back rally.” The 14-day relative-strength index for the S&P 500, a gauge of market momentum, slid to 27.7 yesterday, closing below 30 for the first time since June. The last time the RSI slid below that level, which some technical analysts say indicates a so-called oversold situation, the S&P 500 rallied 15 percent over the next three months before reaching its Sept. 14 peak. Twelve members in the S&P 500 released earnings today. Of companies to have reported third-quarter results so far, 71 percent exceeded analyst profit estimates, while 59 percent missed sales forecasts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wal-Mart Slumps Eight out of 10 groups in the S&P 500 declined, with utility and phone companies erasing 0.7 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. Wal-Mart dropped 3.6 percent to $68.72. Chief Executive Officer Mike Duke has been reducing prices to lure U.S. shoppers that are still suffering amid sluggish economic growth and 7.9 percent unemployment. Discount chains such as Dollar General Corp. and Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR) have attracted some of those customers with smaller-format stores that allow for quicker trips and by adding food items. Target Corp. (TGT) gained 1.7 percent to $62.44. The second- largest U.S. discount retailer said third-quarter profit increased 15 percent as its branded credit cards boosted store sales. Dollar Tree rose 5.1 percent to $39.70. The company, which sells everything from toys to pet food and cleaning supplies for $1 or less, reported third-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates and forecast full-year profit of as much as $2.70 a share, more than the average projection of $2.48 in a Bloomberg survey. Viacom Gains Viacom increased 2.6 percent to $49.23. The media company that owns the Paramount film studio and cable networks such as Nickelodeon and MTV topped analysts’ profit estimates after cutting expenses and getting more money from pay-TV providers. NetApp (NTAP) jumped 11 percent to $30.20 after the maker of data- storage products reported second-quarter earnings excluding some items of 51 cents a share. That topped analysts’ average projection of 48 cents, according to Bloomberg data. The company also announced plans to expand its buyback by $1.5 billion and forecast third-quarter profit of 53 cents to 58 cents a share, compared with a 54-cent average estimate. Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) rose 1.6 percent to $17.94 for the second day of gains. The biggest maker of computer networking equipment rallied 4.8 percent yesterday after its profit topped analysts’ estimates. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) added 1.1 percent to $9.09. The bank will generate $46.8 billion of extra capital over the next three years that it can spend on dividends and stock buybacks, according to analysts at International Strategy & Investment Group LLC. Market Pessimism Pessimism about stocks is at a 15-month high while optimism has fallen to a four-week low, according to a survey from the American Association of Individual Investors. The proportion of investors who anticipate a decline in the next six months jumped 8.9 percentage points to 48.8 percent in the past week, according to the Chicago-based company, which has tracked individual investors’ projections since 1987. Bullish sentiment, or expectations that stocks will rise over the next six months, slumped 9.7 percentage points to 28.8 percent, the data showed. “Combine this with a very oversold market and we’re close to a short term bounce,” Peter Boockvar , equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York, wrote in a note today. Technical analysts, who try to predict stock moves based on price and trading patterns, track investor sentiment as a contrarian indicator. They interpret greater optimism as bearish and increased pessimism as bullish.

White Tells Senators She’d Be Investor Advocate as SEC Chief,['Dave Michaels'],2013-03-12 19:21:02,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/sec-nominee-white-to-face-conflict-questions-at-senate-hearing.html,"Mary Jo White, President Barack Obama ’s choice to run the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, told lawmakers that her work for Wall Street firms won’t affect her ability to be a zealous advocate for investors. The scope of any conflicts of interest is “quite narrow” and would mostly affect SEC enforcement cases, White, 65, said today at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on her nomination. Her participation in writing regulations will be unaffected by her previous representation of clients such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Morgan Stanley (MS) , and UBS AG (UBSN) as a defense lawyer. “The public investors should know I am their advocate,” White said. As a U.S. attorney from 1993 to 2002, “I was exceptionally aggressive against large institutions, CEOs and senior executive types,” she said. White, who has said she would retire from New York-based Debevoise & Plimpton LLP if she’s confirmed, drew bipartisan support at the hearing before the Democrat-led panel. Senator Sherrod Brown , an Ohio Democrat, said last week he wasn’t ready to support White because of concerns over conflicts of interest. “While I will have recusals, as many nominees, mine are not out of the ordinary in scope,” White said. “In general, I’m not recused from any SEC rulemaking or policy matters.” Senator Charles Schumer , a New York Democrat, trumpeted White’s record as a former U.S. attorney who prosecuted terrorists, mobsters and inside traders. Her record “leaves no doubt she will vigorously pursue the SEC’s enforcement agenda,” Schumer said in a statement introducing her to the committee. Economic Impact White’s testimony followed recent warnings from Attorney General Eric Holder that the size of the largest financial institutions make it difficult to fully punish them for wrongdoing. She said in response to a question that the SEC considers the economic impact of penalties it seeks against companies, though those consequences aren’t considered a barrier to bringing a lawsuit. “At the SEC, there is no institution too big to charge,” White said. A top priority would be completing rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and last year’s Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, White said. The SEC should consistently consider the economic costs and benefits of new rules “from the outset,” she wrote in her prepared remarks. Pending Regulations She mostly avoided forecasting her position on pending regulations, although she assured senators that the SEC, not the banking regulators who are members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, should write new rules for money-market mutual funds. Regulators have debated how to limit the risk posed by some money funds since the September 2008 collapse of the $62.5 billion Reserve Primary Fund. “I understand the systemic risk that is trying to be addressed by the discussions,” she said. “I am also acutely aware of the value of money-fund products. Whatever is done, we want to make sure that is not harmed by this.” Questioned by Senator Bob Corker , a Tennessee Republican, White said she would immediately turn her “personal attention” to the Volcker rule, which prohibits proprietary trading by banks. White told Corker she was committed to what he called a “bright line” to distinguish among proprietary trading, hedging activities and market-making. Blocking Cordray White was the focus of most attention at the hearing, where senators also questioned Richard Cordray , Obama’s nominee to be director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Republicans are blocking full Senate consideration of Cordray, looking to restructure the bureau’s leadership and gain oversight over its budget before voting on a permanent director. Senate Republicans haven’t publicly expressed reservations about White’s nomination. The banking committee must approve White’s appointment before it moves to a full Senate vote. Senator Tom Coburn , an Oklahoma Republican, said at today’s hearing he would “aggressively support” her to lead the SEC. Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho said after the hearing that he “would intend to support her.” “You had a bipartisan group praising her and committing to vote for her nomination, so I think she’s going to sail through quite easily,” said Brian Gardner, senior vice president for Washington research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.

Ethanol Falls Most in More Than Week as Production Costs Ease,['Mario Parker'],2012-11-12 21:01:42,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/ethanol-falls-most-in-more-than-week-as-production-costs-ease.html,"Ethanol futures fell the most in more than a week as production costs for the biofuel eased. Prices followed corn lower on speculation supply will be more plentiful than expected. The U.S. Agriculture Department said Nov. 9 that the corn crop will total 10.725 billion bushels, up from an October estimate of 10.706 billion. Ethanol is made from the grain in the U.S. and the profit from making the biofuel is referred to as the crush margin. “Crush margins are a little stronger today,” said Michael Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in New York. Denatured ethanol for December delivery fell 5.4 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.327 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the steepest drop since Nov. 2. Futures have risen 5.6 percent this year. In cash market trading, ethanol in New York dropped 3 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.47 a gallon and in Chicago the additive decreased 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.36, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf fell 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.43 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel was unchanged at $2.545. Corn for December delivery slumped 20.75 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $7.18 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol. Ethanol Spread Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers are losing 28 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from 36 cents on Nov. 9, excluding the revenue that can be made from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The “margin environment is still pretty terrible,” Breitenbach said. At least 10 plants have been idled after drought in the U.S. damaged corn crops and raised prices to a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10. Ethanol has also been hampered by sluggish gasoline demand. Consumption of gasoline in the week ended Nov. 2 fell the most in Energy Department data since Jan. 7, 2005, after Hurricane Sandy shut filling stations and kept drivers off the road. “Gasoline demand continues to be pretty weak,” Breitenbach said. Therefore, demand for ethanol to blend into gasoline is lower, he said. Gasoline Discount Gasoline for December delivery fell 2.29 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.6763 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations. Ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel climbed to 34.93 cents a gallon from 31.82 cents Nov. 9, boosting the biofuel’s luster for refiners to use more in an effort to pocket the spread between the two. Gasoline traded at a premium of 99.8 cents a gallon to ethanol as recently as Sept. 28. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency may announce a decision as early as tomorrow on whether to maintain, reduce or suspend the country’s ethanol mandate, Larry De Maria, a New York-based analyst for William Blair & Co. said in a note today. A bipartisan group of lawmakers asked the Obama administration to halt or lower the requirement for the U.S. to use 13.2 billion gallons of ethanol this year and 13.8 billion next year because of the drought-damaged corn crop.

At least 10 plants have been idled after drought in the U.S. damaged corn crops and raised prices to a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10. Ethanol has also been hampered by sluggish gasoline demand. Consumption of gasoline in the week ended Nov. 2 fell the most in Energy Department data since Jan. 7, 2005, after Hurricane Sandy shut filling stations and kept drivers off the road. “Gasoline demand continues to be pretty weak,” Breitenbach said. Therefore, demand for ethanol to blend into gasoline is lower, he said. Gasoline Discount Gasoline for December delivery fell 2.29 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.6763 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations. Ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel climbed to 34.93 cents a gallon from 31.82 cents Nov. 9, boosting the biofuel’s luster for refiners to use more in an effort to pocket the spread between the two. Gasoline traded at a premium of 99.8 cents a gallon to ethanol as recently as Sept. 28. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency may announce a decision as early as tomorrow on whether to maintain, reduce or suspend the country’s ethanol mandate, Larry De Maria, a New York-based analyst for William Blair & Co. said in a note today. A bipartisan group of lawmakers asked the Obama administration to halt or lower the requirement for the U.S. to use 13.2 billion gallons of ethanol this year and 13.8 billion next year because of the drought-damaged corn crop.

Canada September Factory Sales Rise on Planes and Metals,['Greg Quinn'],2012-11-15 16:45:58,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/canada-september-factory-sales-rise-0-4-on-aircraft-and-metals.html,"Canadian factory sales rose a second month in September on aerospace gains while most other industries, including automobiles, declined. Sales climbed 0.4 percent to C$49.8 billion ($49.7 billion), Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists forecast a 0.3 percent increase according to the median of a Bloomberg survey with 18 responses. The agency also lowered its estimate of August’s gain to 0.9 percent from 1.5 percent. Factory sales have been rising from a low of C$38.1 billion set in May 2009 during Canada’s last recession on gains in automobile, machinery and lumber production geared for shipments to the U.S. Future demand from Canada’s largest trading partner is threatened by the potential for $607 billion of U.S. tax increases and spending cuts due in January, weak productivity growth and a high Canadian dollar. “The modest increase in volumes points to the challenges faced by Canada’s manufacturing sector,” said David Tulk , chief Canada macro strategist in Toronto at Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ’s TD Securities unit. Sales excluding aerospace were “far from encouraging,” he said. Aerospace and parts production jumped 43 percent to C$1.76 billion, the fastest increase since a 66.8 percent gain in May. Excluding aerospace, sales fell 0.7 percent in September. That industry led a 2.2 percent rise in new orders to C$49.6 billion and a 0.3 percent decline in unfilled orders to C$62 billion. Inventories rose 0.2 percent to C$65.2 billion, with the ratio of factory stockpiles unchanged at 1.31. Sales Volumes Excluding price changes, a better indicator of the industry’s contribution to economic growth, factory sales rose 0.4 percent in September. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty this week delayed plans to balance the federal budget by one year and run larger than expected deficits as lower commodity prices and slower growth hamper government revenue. Today’s factory report suggests third-quarter economic growth was even slower than the 1 percent annualized pace the Bank of Canada forecast last month, Krishen Rangasamy , senior economist at National Bank Financial in Montreal , wrote in a note to clients. “The Canadian shipments report looked good on the surface but the details were less impressive,” he wrote. The Canadian dollar added 0.1 percent to C$1.0027 per U.S. dollar at 11:43 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys 99.73 U.S. cents. Pipeline Projects Sales rose in eight of 21 categories tracked by Statistics Canada, accounting for about half of production, including a 3.7 percent gain for primary metals to C$3.86 billion. Metal is needed for projects such as the C$3 billion oil pipeline that TransCanada Corp. (TRP) and a unit of PetroChina Co. Ltd. have agreed to develop to ship crude from oil-sands projects in northern Alberta. TransCanada and Phoenix Energy Holdings Ltd. will each own 50 percent of the proposed Grand Rapids Pipeline. Automobile assembly sales fell 3.6 percent to C$4.58 billion in September, while sales from a year earlier rose 18.2 percent. Factory sales excluding motor vehicles and parts increased 0.9 percent to C$43.3 billion, Statistics Canada said. From a year earlier, factory sales rose 1.8 percent.

Sotheby’s Agrees Joint Venture for Auction House in China,['Frederik Balfour' 'Scott Reyburn'],2012-09-21 13:56:11,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/sotheby-s-agrees-joint-venture-for-auction-house-in-china.html,"Sotheby’s (BID) has signed a 10-year joint-venture agreement to form the first international auction house in China , the company said. Sotheby’s will be investing $1.2 million to take an 80 percent stake in the venture with state-owned Beijing Gehua Cultural Development Group , pending government approval, the New York-based company said today in an e-mailed news release. Until now, international auction houses have not been allowed to hold sales inside China. The venture comes at a time when Beijing is moving to clean up the auction industry that is fraught with fakes, smuggling and non-payment among its more than 1,000 auction houses. “China and its growing class of collectors has been the single most attractive growth market for the company,” Kevin Ching , the chief executive of Sotheby’s Asia , said in the release. The joint venture, called Sotheby’s (Beijing) Auction Co. Ltd., plans to take advantage of the new Tianzhu Free Trade Zone in Beijing being developed by Gehua. Sotheby’s may also hold sales outside the free-trade zone and is free to partner with other entities, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Booming Market Gehua has also partnered with Swiss logistics group Euroasia Investment SA to build a $100 million tax-free storage facility next to Beijing Capital International Airport to tap the booming Chinese art market. Christie’s International has licensed its trademark to Beijing-based auction house Forever. The London-based auction house does not hold sales in China itself. Last year, China overtook the U.S. to become the world’s largest art and antiques market, said a report published by the Netherlands-based European Fine Art Foundation. Auctions in mainland China, Hong Kong , Macau and Taiwan raised 9.8 billion euros ($12 billion) in 2011, said the report. In a separate development, China Guardian Auctions Co. Ltd., the country’s oldest auction house, will be holding its first sales in Hong Kong.

Sotheby’s will be investing $1.2 million to take an 80 percent stake in the venture with state-owned Beijing Gehua Cultural Development Group , pending government approval, the New York-based company said today in an e-mailed news release. Until now, international auction houses have not been allowed to hold sales inside China. The venture comes at a time when Beijing is moving to clean up the auction industry that is fraught with fakes, smuggling and non-payment among its more than 1,000 auction houses. “China and its growing class of collectors has been the single most attractive growth market for the company,” Kevin Ching , the chief executive of Sotheby’s Asia , said in the release. The joint venture, called Sotheby’s (Beijing) Auction Co. Ltd., plans to take advantage of the new Tianzhu Free Trade Zone in Beijing being developed by Gehua. Sotheby’s may also hold sales outside the free-trade zone and is free to partner with other entities, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Booming Market Gehua has also partnered with Swiss logistics group Euroasia Investment SA to build a $100 million tax-free storage facility next to Beijing Capital International Airport to tap the booming Chinese art market. Christie’s International has licensed its trademark to Beijing-based auction house Forever. The London-based auction house does not hold sales in China itself. Last year, China overtook the U.S. to become the world’s largest art and antiques market, said a report published by the Netherlands-based European Fine Art Foundation. Auctions in mainland China, Hong Kong , Macau and Taiwan raised 9.8 billion euros ($12 billion) in 2011, said the report. In a separate development, China Guardian Auctions Co. Ltd., the country’s oldest auction house, will be holding its first sales in Hong Kong. The company’s inaugural auction at the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong on Oct. 7 will include more than 300 Chinese ink paintings and 40 pieces of classical furniture.

Ex-World Cup Referee Collina Doesn’t Favor Goal-Line Technology,['Tariq Panja'],2011-10-06 12:08:54,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/ex-world-cup-referee-collina-doesn-t-favor-goal-line-technology.html,"Former World Cup referee Pierluigi Collina, who sits on European soccer body UEFA’s referee committee, says the sport doesn’t need goal-line technology to assist on-field rulings. The Italian, who oversaw the 2002 World Cup final, said an experiment using additional referees behind goals in the Champions League and Europa League competitions over the past two seasons has proved successfully. He said the additional officials haven’t missed a single goal. Soccer’s rule-makers, the International Football Association Board , will make a decision in March on whether to use technology after asking a number of companies to participate in tests over the past year. The body was forced into revisiting the issue after England was denied what would have been an equalizing goal in its second-round World Cup 2010 defeat to Germany. “I think a goal line could easily be controlled by two assistant referees and the goal could be achieved,” Collina told an audience at the Leaders in Football conference in London. “Now we are running the experiments and I have to say the feedback we’ve got so far has been very positive.” Collina’s comments echo the position of UEFA President Michel Platini , who says he’s opposed to technology because he thinks it would remove the “human” element from the sport. FIFA President Sepp Blatter , speaking to reporters in Wales after a meeting of the IFAB last year, said technology could be brought in ahead of the 2014 World Cup if the tests, which include some that use micro-chipped balls and others that rely on additional cameras, prove successful. “If it works definitely, the board will say yes to the technology,” Blatter said. “If the board says yes,” then there should be no problem to have it in 2014, he said. Frank de Bleeckere, a Belgium referee who works FIFA tournaments and the Champions League , said technology has been tested since 2005 but hasn’t proved accurate. He described a match at the 2007 Under-17 World Cup in Peru where a digital display on his watch showed five goals had been scored rather than the two that actually went in. “Every time the ball went over the bar it was a goal,” he said.

Sharp Rises After Report of Tie-Up Talks With Intel: Tokyo Mover,['Mariko Yasu'],2012-09-21 01:47:44,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/sharp-rises-after-report-of-tie-up-talks-with-intel-tokyo-mover.html,"Sharp Corp. (6753) , the Japanese electronics maker renegotiating a stake sale to Foxconn Technology Group, rose in Tokyo trading after the Mainichi newspaper said it was in talks with Intel Corp. (INTC) for a possible capital tie-up. The shares jumped as much as 8.4 percent to 219 yen, the biggest gain since Sept. 4, and traded at 211 yen as of 10:30 a.m. in Tokyo. Japan ’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 0.3 percent. Sharp, Japan’s largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, may agree with Santa Clara , California-based Intel as early as next month to receive at least 30 billion yen ($383 million) from the world’s largest semiconductor maker, the Mainichi newspaper reported, without citing anyone. The companies may collaborate in the smartphone business, the report said. “There is no truth to the report,” Heihachiro Ochiai, a Sharp spokesman in Osaka , said by phone today. Chuck Mulloy , a spokesman for Intel, said the company doesn’t comment on speculation or rumors. Sharp’s September 2013 convertible bonds gained 4.8 percent to 66 yen per face value of 100 yen as of 10:30 a.m., heading for the biggest daily gain since Aug. 17. “Sharp’s financing issue has been the center of attention and the report led to an expectation that may improve,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Nevertheless, even if the report is true, the amount reported isn’t enough to solve Sharp’s debt problem. The rally probably won’t last.” Job Cuts The maker of Aquos televisions has been renegotiating terms for the proposed stake sale to Taipei-based Foxconn after Osaka- based Sharp widened its full-year loss forecast eightfold in August, triggering a slide in its shares. Foxconn agreed with Sharp in March to invest 67 billion yen for a 9.9 percent stake in the TV maker at 550 yen a share. Sharp President Takashi Okuda is cutting 5,000 jobs and has put up properties as collateral to raise funds as the company projects a second consecutive annual loss. The company plans to return to profit next fiscal year with the help of job cuts and cost reductions, Okuda told employees last week. The company is considering a target of 30 billion yen net income for the year starting April 1, Kyodo News reported, without citing anyone. Sharp is working on a contingency plan to present to banks as the company faces a deadline for repaying debt, it said Sept. 7. The electronics maker has turned to its lenders for financial support as commercial papers come due and after Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service cut its credit ratings to junk. The company had 706 billion yen of short-term debt maturing within 12 months and 314 billion yen in long-term debts at the end of June, according to its latest quarterly financial statement. Sharp’s cash and near-cash stood at 218 billion yen at the time.

Libyans in Benghazi Mourn Americans as Islamists Targeted,['Christopher Stephen'],2012-09-26 22:04:51,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/cradle-of-libyan-uprising-mourns-americans-as-islamists-targeted.html,"An Arabic sign written with a black marker pen rests among the floral wreaths on the iron gates of the deserted U.S. consulate compound in Benghazi, two weeks after Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans died in an attack blamed on Islamist militiamen. “Hey!” it says to Libya’s new parliament. “Where’s the security for us and our guests?” The sign stands near an ocher-painted concrete pillar still bearing a bloody handprint from the Sept. 11 attack, and encapsulates what many Benghazi residents say they feel about the consulate assault and the city’s uncertain prospects now the Americans and other Westerners have left. “The American people I have met are good, and I hope they think the same about us,” said Benghazi aviation student Mohammed El Gadari in an interview. “Some extremists killed the ambassador, and they must be punished, but it doesn’t mean we want to kill foreigners. We want Benghazi to be a cosmopolitan city.” Libya’s second-biggest city was the cradle of last year’s uprising that overthrew the four-decade dictatorship of Muammar Qaddafi. As the regime’s forces approached newly liberated Benghazi in March 2011 threatening reprisals, President Barack Obama and allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization launched an aerial campaign to halt them and prevent what the U.S. leader termed “a massacre that would have reverberated across the region and stained the conscience of the world.” ‘Justice for Stevens’ Some 18 months later, the Libyan government accused Islamist militiamen of killing the U.S. ambassador, an act that brought tens of thousands into the streets to protest on Sept. 21-22. A number carried signs in English reading “We Demand Justice for Stevens,” and at least four people died as demonstrators assaulted Islamist militia bases. The U.S. also has promised a response. Obama told the United Nations General Assembly Sept. 25 that the attack on the consulate was an attack on America and vowed that the U.S. would be “relentless” in pursuing the killers. In Washington , Republican lawmakers in both chambers of Congress yesterday accused the administration of downplaying the possible role of al-Qaeda’s North African affiliate in the attack. While Libyan authorities say they’ve arrested eight people linked to the deaths, they’ve given no further details. A guard at the Benghazi consulate said residents in the upscale district worry that the Americans may not return. “People in the district are very sad, they say this act is haram,” or forbidden under Islamic law, says the guard, Hamid Idris, who wears a black baseball cap with “Security” in bold white letters. At the city’s Gawash riding stables, where 30 horses are kept in crumbling white-washed brick stalls, rider Asidm Bashir said in an interview that most people in Benghazi were shocked by the attack. Weak Government “Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, had a saying about not killing an envoy, a diplomat,” he said. “But every religion has its extremes.” Some Benghazi residents say that the port city is not anti- American, rather the attack is a consequence of a weak government unable to control a small jihadist insurgency. Two British bodyguards were injured in June when unidentified attackers tried to kill Dominic Asquith, the U.K. ambassador to Libya. “In the absence of an effective state security apparatus, violence in Libya is pervasive and there are a range of violent actors and agendas,” said a report posted yesterday by Geoff Porter of the Counter-Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. “The new Libyan state does not exert a monopoly on force and the line between state and non- state actors is blurred.” “Security is a top priority for the next three to six months and 70 percent of our efforts are dedicated to stabilizing Libya,” Prime Minister-elect Mustafa Abushagur said in a Sept. 20 interview. For now, chaos is commonplace. Police officers blocked Benghazi’s streets, causing long traffic queues on Sept. 24 and 25, complaining that they had not been paid for five months. Former Rebels “Libya is a rich country,” said Benghazi pharmacist Abdulrahman Yunis in an interview. “We are not anti-American, we want to reach out to the world.” While some militias, including Islamists, have been licensed by the interim government to carry out internal security duties during the past year, they don’t guard the country’s oil fields. Instead, some former rebels are being trained to protect oil installations by the Ministry of Defense, the National Oil Corp. said Sept. 25. Benghazi is headquarters for the Arabian Gulf Oil Co., which is responsible for Libya’s most productive fields, the Sarir group south of the city. Agoco spokesman Abdeljalil Mayuf said the company was relying on Interior Ministry units to secure its offices and national army brigades to guard three key fields. ‘Something Better’ “We don’t depend on the militias” and “there is nobody from the private sector,” he said in an interview. “When people see private security they think ‘Iraq’ and ‘Blackwater’ and that sort of thing. The fields are secured by the army.” Oil executives and most Benghazi citizens were saddened by the ambassador’s death, he said. Many fear jihadists mean to subvert Libya’s democracy, which saw the first free national elections in more than 40 years in July, and bring back a dictatorship similar to Qaddafi’s. While the Libyan people are Muslims, “they are against Islamists,” Mayuf said. “We kicked out Qaddafi, but we don’t want to create a state like Iraq or Somalia. The Libyan people, they want something better.” The country’s Islamist parties failed to win a parliamentary majority in July, unlike neighboring Egypt and Tunisia. ’Pre-Planned’ Terrorism As a result of last week’s demonstrations and riots, two Islamist militias disbanded, including Ansar al-Shariah, which the government accused of links to the Stevens attack. The White House says the killings were acts of terrorism while the head of Libya’s newly elected National Congress, Mohamed Magariaf, told NBC News yesterday that the attack was a “pre-planned act of terrorism” timed to Sept. 11 and was not connected to an amateur film made in the U.S. that caused protests across the Muslim world. The government has given two other Islamist brigades, Rafallah al-Sahati and the February 17 Brigades, permission to stay, albeit with new army-appointed commanders. “The danger is members of Ansar al-Shariah will go into the shadows,” said Ishmail Salabi, a senior commander of Rafallah al-Sahati and a prominent Islamist, in an interview on Sept. 24. at a private house chosen out of fears he may be targeted by anti-militia forces. New protests are expected after Friday prayers on Sept. 28, with activists demanding justice for the four protesters killed in rioting at the Rafallah al-Sahati base. Protect Civilians Benghazi’s army commander, General Hamad Belkhair, said next time protesters will be protected by his men. He’s also seeking an investigation into the deaths of six soldiers from the 1st Infantry Brigade found with their hands bound and gunshot wounds to the back of the head near the Rafallah base on Sept. 23. “My troops saw civilians getting badly treated” by Islamists during the riots, Belkhair said in an interview. “They think they should protect the civilians.” The general himself was kidnapped on Sept. 22 and held for six hours by masked gunmen who accused him of being an “infidel” and warned him against army action aimed at jihadists, he said. Meanwhile, the Islamists insist they are here to stay as a counterweight to police units such as the national gendarmerie, which they say is packed with Qaddafi loyalists. “Raffalah al-Sahati are Islamist, we won’t support anything but the Shariah,” Salabi said in reference to Islamic law.

A guard at the Benghazi consulate said residents in the upscale district worry that the Americans may not return. “People in the district are very sad, they say this act is haram,” or forbidden under Islamic law, says the guard, Hamid Idris, who wears a black baseball cap with “Security” in bold white letters. At the city’s Gawash riding stables, where 30 horses are kept in crumbling white-washed brick stalls, rider Asidm Bashir said in an interview that most people in Benghazi were shocked by the attack. Weak Government “Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, had a saying about not killing an envoy, a diplomat,” he said. “But every religion has its extremes.” Some Benghazi residents say that the port city is not anti- American, rather the attack is a consequence of a weak government unable to control a small jihadist insurgency. Two British bodyguards were injured in June when unidentified attackers tried to kill Dominic Asquith, the U.K. ambassador to Libya. “In the absence of an effective state security apparatus, violence in Libya is pervasive and there are a range of violent actors and agendas,” said a report posted yesterday by Geoff Porter of the Counter-Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. “The new Libyan state does not exert a monopoly on force and the line between state and non- state actors is blurred.” “Security is a top priority for the next three to six months and 70 percent of our efforts are dedicated to stabilizing Libya,” Prime Minister-elect Mustafa Abushagur said in a Sept. 20 interview. For now, chaos is commonplace. Police officers blocked Benghazi’s streets, causing long traffic queues on Sept. 24 and 25, complaining that they had not been paid for five months. Former Rebels “Libya is a rich country,” said Benghazi pharmacist Abdulrahman Yunis in an interview. “We are not anti-American, we want to reach out to the world.” While some militias, including Islamists, have been licensed by the interim government to carry out internal security duties during the past year, they don’t guard the country’s oil fields. Instead, some former rebels are being trained to protect oil installations by the Ministry of Defense, the National Oil Corp. said Sept. 25. Benghazi is headquarters for the Arabian Gulf Oil Co., which is responsible for Libya’s most productive fields, the Sarir group south of the city. Agoco spokesman Abdeljalil Mayuf said the company was relying on Interior Ministry units to secure its offices and national army brigades to guard three key fields. ‘Something Better’ “We don’t depend on the militias” and “there is nobody from the private sector,” he said in an interview. “When people see private security they think ‘Iraq’ and ‘Blackwater’ and that sort of thing. The fields are secured by the army.” Oil executives and most Benghazi citizens were saddened by the ambassador’s death, he said. Many fear jihadists mean to subvert Libya’s democracy, which saw the first free national elections in more than 40 years in July, and bring back a dictatorship similar to Qaddafi’s. While the Libyan people are Muslims, “they are against Islamists,” Mayuf said. “We kicked out Qaddafi, but we don’t want to create a state like Iraq or Somalia. The Libyan people, they want something better.” The country’s Islamist parties failed to win a parliamentary majority in July, unlike neighboring Egypt and Tunisia. ’Pre-Planned’ Terrorism As a result of last week’s demonstrations and riots, two Islamist militias disbanded, including Ansar al-Shariah, which the government accused of links to the Stevens attack. The White House says the killings were acts of terrorism while the head of Libya’s newly elected National Congress, Mohamed Magariaf, told NBC News yesterday that the attack was a “pre-planned act of terrorism” timed to Sept. 11 and was not connected to an amateur film made in the U.S. that caused protests across the Muslim world. The government has given two other Islamist brigades, Rafallah al-Sahati and the February 17 Brigades, permission to stay, albeit with new army-appointed commanders. “The danger is members of Ansar al-Shariah will go into the shadows,” said Ishmail Salabi, a senior commander of Rafallah al-Sahati and a prominent Islamist, in an interview on Sept. 24. at a private house chosen out of fears he may be targeted by anti-militia forces. New protests are expected after Friday prayers on Sept. 28, with activists demanding justice for the four protesters killed in rioting at the Rafallah al-Sahati base. Protect Civilians Benghazi’s army commander, General Hamad Belkhair, said next time protesters will be protected by his men. He’s also seeking an investigation into the deaths of six soldiers from the 1st Infantry Brigade found with their hands bound and gunshot wounds to the back of the head near the Rafallah base on Sept. 23. “My troops saw civilians getting badly treated” by Islamists during the riots, Belkhair said in an interview. “They think they should protect the civilians.” The general himself was kidnapped on Sept. 22 and held for six hours by masked gunmen who accused him of being an “infidel” and warned him against army action aimed at jihadists, he said. Meanwhile, the Islamists insist they are here to stay as a counterweight to police units such as the national gendarmerie, which they say is packed with Qaddafi loyalists. “Raffalah al-Sahati are Islamist, we won’t support anything but the Shariah,” Salabi said in reference to Islamic law.

Sierra Leone Election Caps Shift From Civil War to Economic Boom,['Silas Gb' 'ia' 'Emily Bowers'],2012-11-15 21:00:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/sierra-leone-election-caps-shift-from-civil-war-to-economic-boom.html,"Sierra Leonean President Ernest Bai Koroma is seeking re-election after he introduced policies that lured more foreign investment and helped the country become sub- Saharan Africa ’s fastest-growing economy. Koroma, 59, faces eight challengers including Julius Maada Bio of the Sierra Leone People’s Party, which ruled the country before Koroma came to office in 2007. None of the candidates will probably secure the 55 percent needed for a first-round win, said Jean-Baptiste Bouzard, Africa analyst with Bath, U.K.- based risk-analysis company Maplecroft. An expanding economy and support from his Temne ethnic group, the country’s largest, should give Koroma the edge in a runoff, he said. “Koroma’s economic achievements during his first term, his strong support base among the Temne ethnic group, and his effective use of political alliances are expected to secure victory,” he said in an e-mailed response to questions Nov. 13. Sierra Leone’s $2.2 billion economy will expand 21.3 percent this year and 7.5 percent in 2013, fueled by diamond mining and iron-ore production by London-based African Minerals Ltd. (AMI) and London Mining Plc (LOND) , according to the International Monetary Fund. Foreign-direct investment soared to $3 billion so far this year from $200 million in 2007, Koroma said in an interview in Freetown, the capital, on Nov. 10. The West African nation of 6 million people, founded as a British colony and a home for former slaves in 1808, gained notoriety during the 1991-2002 civil war for the tactic used by Revolutionary United Front rebels of chopping off the hands and legs of civilians and using child soldiers. Results from the election will be announced next week. Economic Boom Koroma, leader of the All People’s Congress, may have “an edge looking at the GDP growth, drop in inflation and investment ventures in the mining and agricultural sectors that have created jobs,” Victor Koroma, chairman of the Freetown-based Civil Society Consultative Forum, said in an interview. Inflation slowed to 11.6 percent in September, the lowest this year, according to Statistics Sierra Leone , with the rate forecast to average 13.7 percent this year compared with 18.5 percent a year earlier, IMF data shows. If Koroma wins, he’s likely to continue programs put in place during his first term, with priority on infrastructure and energy, said Bouzard. Sierra Leone remains among the world’s poorest nations, ranking 180th out of 187 countries on the United Nations Development Programme’s Human Development Index, which measures indicators such as life expectancy and income. At the end of the civil war a decade ago, Sierra Leone was at the bottom of the HDI table. British Troops The conflict killed at least 50,000 people and forced 2 million to flee their homes. It ended after British troops sent by U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair to evacuate foreigners were intervened to defeat the rebels. In April, Charles Taylor , the former president of neighboring Liberia, was found guilty by the International Criminal Court for his role in aiding the rebels in Sierra Leone. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison. During the election campaign, SLPP and APC supporters clashed in pockets of violence in the country’s east and south, according to Control Risks, the London-based risk consultancy. Ten people were injured in the eastern diamond-mining region of Kono on Oct. 28 and party activists clashed in the Southern province town of Bo on Nov. 2, the risk advisory group said in a note to clients. Violence “While a post-election dispute over the results has the potential to act as a catalyst for renewed violence, the state apparatus should be capable of restoring order,” said Maplecroft’s Bouzard. “The risk of violence spiralling out of control appears to be low.” The government will deploy soldiers to ensure peace in the vote, Koroma said. “The elections will be peaceful,” he said. This year’s campaign has been less tense than in 2007, with parties being allowed to hold rallies in strongholds of their opponents and candidates urging peace, said Koroma of the civil society group. Koroma’s decision to retain Vice President Samuel Sam Sumana as his running mate after he was linked to two corruption investigations this year “illustrates the primacy of domestic political imperatives over concerns about the government’s international reputation,” according to Control Risks. Sumana’s hometown of Koidu is the capital of the Kono region that is considered a swing area and supported the SLPP in 2007, the group said. Mining Contracts Bio, a Mende, the country’s second-biggest ethnic group, has pledged to tackle government corruption, accusing Koroma of putting “immunity” around “sacred cows,” according to remarks on his campaign website. The 48-year-old former military ruler has also pledged to review mining contracts signed by Koroma’s government. “We are not yet there on people voting solely on issues,” civil society’s Koroma said. “Maybe it works for the elites, but a good number of people still pay attention to regional and tribal attachments to determine who to vote for.” Polls open at 7 a.m. tomorrow, with final results released a week after the vote, according to the electoral commission, based in Freetown, the capital. Ballots will also be cast for the 112 elected members of Parliament.
