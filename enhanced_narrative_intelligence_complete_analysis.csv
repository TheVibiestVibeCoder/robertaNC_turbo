U.A.E. Shares Rally to 5-Year High on Earnings; Saudi Climbs,['Sherine El Madany'],2013-07-21 12:33:24,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-21/u-a-e-shares-rally-to-5-year-high-on-earnings-saudi-climbs.html,"United Arab Emirates stock indexes rallied to the highest levels in almost five years on bets the economic recovery will spur company earnings. Saudi Arabian shares rose after Saudi Basic Industries Corp. reported results. Dubai’s benchmark DFM General Index (DSM) gained 1.8 percent to 2,541.52, the strongest since November 2008, at the close in the emirate, as Dubai Investments PJSC (DIC) jumped 6.1 percent, taking its three-day advance to 16 percent. Abu Dhabi ’s ADX General Index (MSM30) increased for an 11th day, its longest stretch of gains in two months, climbing 0.9 percent to 3,857.52, the highest since September 2008. Dubai’s economy, which is recovering after a property market crash, is set to grow 4.6 percent, on average, between 2012 and 2015, more than twice as fast as in the prior four years, government forecasts show. Tamweel PJSC (TAMWEEL) , a mortgage provider based in the emirate, jumped 3.6 percent to 1.16 dirhams, the highest close in a month, after reporting a 40 percent increase in second-quarter profit. “The strength we’ve seen over the last three quarters clearly indicates strong expectations for earnings to improve, and growing bottom lines are a validation of market strength thus far,” said Amer Khan, a Dubai-based director at Shuaa Asset Management. The rally “points to how confident investors are in the prospects for the U.A.E. economy to continue recovering and growing,” he said. The DFM and ADX are among the world’s top-five best-performing indexes this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of Dubai Financial Market (DFM) , which have more than doubled this year, rallied 4.6 percent today before the company reported an almost seven-fold increase in quarterly profit after market hours. Sabic Results Saudi Arabia ’s Tadawul All Share Index advanced for the first time in three days, gaining 1 percent to 7,740.46 after Sabic, the world’s largest petrochemicals company by market value, said it was studying investment opportunities in the U.S. as the economic slowdown in Europe and China hurt its second-quarter sales. The stock advanced 1.4 percent, the most since May 21, to 93.50 riyals. “Numbers are weaker than estimates, though, given affiliates also failed to meet estimates, this miss is expected,” Sriharsha Pappu, a Dubai-based analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc, said by phone. Pappu, who has a buy rating on the shares, said analysts estimated Sabic (SABIC) ’s earnings before the company’s units reported results. “We’re looking for better third-quarter results. This quarter is mostly down to pricing.” Elsewhere in the Middle East , Egypt ’s benchmark EGX 30 Index rose 1.4 percent, the most since July 9, as the nation’s interim cabinet convenes for the first time today. Oman’s MSM30 Index increased 0.2 percent and Kuwait’s gauge climbed 0.6 percent. Qatar’s QE Index fell 0.1 percent and Bahrain’s measure lost 0.3 percent. In Israel , the benchmark TA-25 Index (TA-25) decreased 0.1 percent at 3:33 p.m. in Tel Aviv , while the yield on the benchmark 4.25 percent bonds due in March 2023 declined three basis points to 3.68 percent.

Bosh finished with 23 points last night in San Antonio, Texas, to lead the Heat, who were without James, Wade and Mario Chalmers because of injuries. “We are the defending champions no matter who we put out there,” Bosh told reporters after Miami won for the 29th time in its past 30 games. “We are still the Miami Heat.” The previous time Miami and San Antonio played in January, the Spurs were fined $250,000 by the NBA for holding Tim Duncan , Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker out of the game. The Spurs won that meeting 105-100. Duncan and Kawhi Leonard each scored 17 points last night for the Spurs (55-18). Miami is now an NBA-best 58-15.

The transportation proposals are expected to become legally binding by end of April, the U.K. oil and gas producer said. They include “substantial” information about the technical, regulatory, and financial aspects of the Nabucco West and TAP projects, according to the statement.

An average Atlantic season produces 11 storms, according to the center.

German Factory Orders Unexpectedly Fall,['Jeff Black'],2011-10-06 10:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/german-factory-orders-unexpectedly-fall.html,"German factory orders unexpectedly fell for a second month in August as domestic demand waned. Orders, adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation, declined 1.4 percent from July, when they dropped 2.6 percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said in a statement today. Economists forecast no change from the previous month, according to the median of 36 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. In the year, orders rose 3.9 percent when adjusted for work days. Concerns that Europe ’s debt crisis and slowing global growth could drag the economy back into recession may prompt companies to put off investment. European confidence in the economic outlook dropped to the lowest in almost two years last month. At the same time, German business sentiment fell less than forecast, suggesting Europe’s largest economy may be spared a slump. “There is the danger that the market nervousness about the debt situation will affect companies more strongly,” said Jens Kramer, an economist at NordLB in Hanover, Germany. “That doesn’t necessarily mean a recession. We shouldn’t talk one into existence.” While domestic factory orders fell 3.2 percent in August, the ministry said holidays affected demand and there was a below-average number of big-ticket sales. Orders from abroad rose 0.1 percent, with sales to other euro-area nations gaining 2.7 percent. Orders for investment goods declined 1.3 percent and orders for consumer goods dropped 5.6 percent. The drop in overall orders in July was revised from 2.8 percent. ‘One-Off Effects’ “Manufacturing demand has been influenced by one-off effects in recent months,” the ministry said. Demand in the three months through August compared with the previous three- month period showed a gain of 1.5 percent, it said. “Still, overall the orders dynamic has noticeably lost momentum.” Railroad equipment maker Vossloh AG (VOS) said on Sept. 29 that it reduced its sales forecast for 2011 for a second time due to lower orders from southern Europe and “weak” Chinese demand. At the same time, Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s largest maker of heavy-duty vehicles, said demand for Mercedes-Benz trucks hasn’t shown signs of being damped by slowing economic growth. “In spite of the debt crisis, we have good reason to be optimistic,” Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche said in a speech on Sept. 30. Mercedes-Benz truck plants will be working at full capacity through the end of this year and have “a good level” of orders for the first quarter, he said. Heightened Danger Euro-area services and manufacturing output shrank for the first time in more than two years in September. The euro-area economy may fail to gather strength in the current quarter, expanding 0.2 percent from the previous three months before cooling to 0.1 percent growth in the final quarter, the European Commission in Brussels forecast last month. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said on Sept. 26 there is a “heightened danger” that financial market turmoil caused by uncertainty over the debt crisis will begin to affect the real economy. European governments this week hinted that bondholders may be saddled with bigger losses on Greek debt, intensifying market jitters that a second aid package designed to quell the fiscal crisis might unravel. France and Belgium are considering a second bailout of Dexia SA (DEXB) after the crisis reduced its ability to obtain funding. While the Bundesbank’s current forecast is for the German economy to expand about 3 percent this year, it said last month that the outlook “has clouded more than previously expected.” “Growth in the second half of the year will be significantly weaker than in the first,” said Ralph Solveen , head of economic research at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “We still think that Germany will be able to dodge a recession.” To contact the reporter on this story: Jeff Black in Frankfurt at  Jblack25@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Craig Stirling at  cstirling1@bloomberg.net",['Jeff Black'],"German Factory Orders Unexpectedly Fall German factory orders unexpectedly fell for a second month in August as domestic demand waned.

While the Bundesbank’s current forecast is for the German economy to expand about 3 percent this year, it said last month that the outlook “has clouded more than previously expected.” “Growth in the second half of the year will be significantly weaker than in the first,” said Ralph Solveen , head of economic research at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “We still think that Germany will be able to dodge a recession.” To contact the reporter on this story: Jeff Black in Frankfurt at  Jblack25@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Craig Stirling at  cstirling1@bloomberg.net",4028,644,46,54.14149532710283,10,3,False,40,10,4,True,False,5.251552795031056,-1,0,-1,-1,negative,0.9640908241271973,fear,0.9640908241271973,negative,0.9739739894866943,,0,

(AAPL) ’s future iPhones may look very different from present models, if a recently published patent application is any indication. The Cupertino, California-based company submitted an application, published in the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on March 28, for what it calls “an electronic device with wrap-around display.” According to application 20130076612 , the mobile device will have a flexible display housing that is enclosed in a transparent housing. Apple said any portion of the display can show visual content. The present configuration of most mobile devices leaves its sides and rear surfaces “unused or at best configured with buttons and switches with fixed location and functionality,” according to the application. Because many of the device’s buttons and switches have fixed functionality they can’t always be incorporated into third-party applications, Apple said. The aim of the new configuration would be to provide functionality on more than one surface, Apple said. The company applied for the patent in September 2011. Unlike many Apple patent applications or patents related to the appearance of the company’s products, the application doesn’t name the late Steve Jobs , the company founder, as an inventor.

Trademark Penn Accuses California Company of Being Wharton Imposter The University of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit accusing a California company of violating a trademark associated with the Wharton Business School. The Wharton Business Foundation, which has locations in Beverly Hills, California, and Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, is using Penn’s 132-year-old Wharton trademark without authorization, lawyers for the university said in a complaint made public March 28 in federal court in Philadelphia. The company’s use of the name “creates a likelihood of confusion in the marketplace,” the University of Pennsylvania said in its complaint. Wharton Business Foundation operates a website with the Wharton name and offers services including business education and business consultation through its Wharton Business Foundation University, according to the complaint. The company also advertises and has a toll-free phone number 888-4-WHARTON, the university said in its filing. Penn has been using the Wharton registered mark for business education since as early as 1881 and for business consultation since 1953, lawyers for the university said in the filing. According to the school’s website , the name comes from businessman and entrepreneur Joseph Wharton, who established “the world’s first collegiate school of business” at the university in 1881. The university is seeking a jury trial and a court order barring the misuse of its mark. Officials at the Wharton Business Foundation didn’t immediately return a phone message seeking comment on the complaint. The case is The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania v. Wharton Business Foundation, 13-cv-01616, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). Del Monte Barred From Some Labeling, Product-Dating Practices Del Monte Foods Co., the maker of canned fruit and pet products controlled by KKR & Co., is barred from using its trademark on refrigerated food products containing five specified kinds of fruit. A federal court in Manhattan told the San Francisco-based food company that it violated a licensing agreement with its 1989 spinoff Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. (FDP) , and falsely informed customers that some of its products that contained preservatives had to be refrigerated The order came in resolution of the contract-dispute suit Fresh filed against Del Monte in 2008. Fresh, based in Coral Gables, Florida, claimed that the California company breached a trademark licensing agreement. According to court papers, the agreement limited Del Monte Foods’ exclusive use of the Del Monte mark to preserved produce and gave Fresh the rights to use it with fresh fruit and vegetables. The dispute centered on the parties’ different interpretations of a license agreement with respect to refrigerated pineapple, melons, berries, papayas and bananas regardless of whether they are fresh or preserved. Following a jury verdict that Del Monte had violated trademark law with respect to some of the products, it gave Fresh a damages award of $7.2 million. Fresh then sought a court order controlling aspects of Del Monte’s packaging and marketing. In his March 28 order, U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein said Del Monte is barred from using the trademark on any product containing any of the five fruits that is intended to be refrigerated or chilled at the point of sale. If Del Monte’s customers are refrigerating these products, the California company is required to tell them in writing that they aren’t permitted to sell them under refrigeration. The company is also barred from pasteurizing or adding chemical preservatives to its fruit products without saying so. The judge said that while Del Monte didn’t have to add “‘Contains Preservatives’’ on the front label, it must state on the ingredient list that certain chemicals added are preservatives. Additionally, Del Monte cannot put ‘‘best by’’ or ‘‘sell by’’ dates on its products without test results that justify the existence of such a date, he said. The case is Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. v. Del Monte Foods Co., 08-cv-08718, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). ‘Star Wars’ Movie May Guide Big East on Selecting New Name Darth Vader might serve as inspiration for the Big East Conference, which must change its name after the so-called Catholic Seven leaves in three months and takes the league’s moniker with them. Among the names suggested by the marketing firm Duffy & Shanley when the conference formed in 1979 was Galactic East, which the company said was inspired by the 1977 movie ‘‘Star Wars.’’ Other suggestions were the Empire Conference, Conference One, Eastern One, Olympic Conference and Eastern Compact, according to the plan, a copy of which was provided to Bloomberg News by Dave Duffy, a partner in the firm at the time. Geographic-based suggestions were the Big East, Met-East and North Atlantic Alliance. Heritage-based suggestions were the Patriot Athletic Conference, Colonial League and Mayflower Compact. The firm’s principal recommendation was the Big East, which will be used by the seven departing schools that include Georgetown University , Villanova University and Providence College. Joseph Shanley, the father of current Providence College President Brian Shanley, was a partner in the marketing firm. ‘‘All the great brands of the world -- General Electric, Coca-Cola, they have a lot of roots,’’ Duffy, 73, said in a telephone interview from Florida. ‘‘It would be hard for the new basketball league to start over and match that.’’ Covington & Burling LLP attorney Marie Lavalleye, acting as a representative of the league, on March 6 filed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the term ‘‘America 12 Conference.’’ She didn’t return a telephone calling seeking comment on the name change. Duffy & Shanley, in the original marketing plan, said the conference’s name, at least in the beginning, shouldn’t include a number because conference members are sure to change, a recommendation he said is even more valid today with the realignment in college sports. Shanley, the Providence president, earlier this month said ‘‘the landscape in college sports has not stopped morphing.” Since 2011, the Big East has lost 16 schools that were either members or dropped out before playing a game. The Pac-10 Conference, meantime, became the Pac-12 after adding two schools. The Big Ten Conference hasn’t had 10 teams since Penn State University joined in 1990. While the Big Ten didn’t change its name at the time, it did alter its logo to reflect an 11th team. The current Big Ten has 12 football members and is adding more. DuPont Drops Trademark-Infringement Suit Against Easton-Bell DuPont Co. (DD) , the maker of Corian countertops and Tyvek packaging materials, dropped a trademark-infringement lawsuit against a California maker of sports equipment. The suit, filed Jan. 28 in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, accused Easton-Bell Sports Inc. of Scotts Valley, California, of infringing the chemical company’s “Kevlar” trademark. DuPont, based in Wilmington, said the size of the Kevlar trademark on Easton-Bell’s packaging was even larger than the California company’s own mark, according to the complaint Easton-Bell has sold and marketed bicycle tires and locks in packaging displaying the Kevlar trademark since July, according to court papers. Such products are sold through retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. (TGT) and Amazon.com Inc., DuPont said. Easton-Bell sued in federal court in San Francisco on Jan. 18, seeking a court declaration that it didn’t infringe the DuPont trademark. In its pleadings, Easton-Bell said it has bought Kevlar from authorized distributors and resellers for at least six years and used it in bike tires and locks. Indicating on its packaging that the products contain Kevlar “has no likelihood of causing confusion,” the company claimed. On March 26, a magistrate judge refused to dismiss Easton- Bell’s case and rejected DuPont’s request that the dispute be transferred to Delaware. He said that DuPont’s request for a transfer was inappropriate. Dupont didn’t give any reason for dropping its suit against Easton-Bell. According to the March 28 filing, Easton-Bell hadn’t answered the complaint or asked that the case be dismissed. The DuPont case is E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. Easton- Bell Sports Inc., 1:13-cv-00150, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). The earlier case is Easton-Bell Sports v. E.I.

Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage Obama Urged by Democrats to Act on China’s Alleged Cyber Thefts President Barack Obama ’s administration should take action to curb China’s alleged cyber theft, two House Democrats said, after a top U.S. official accused the Asian nation of industrial espionage against American companies. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office needs to designate China as a top violator of intellectual property rights, which can lead to further trade restrictions, Representatives Sander Levin of Michigan and Charles Rangel of New York said March 28 in a letter to Acting USTR Demetrios Marantis. “In the case of China, the government itself appears to be actively stealing the intellectual property of American businesses,” the lawmakers, ranking Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, which deals with trade issues, wrote. China’s cyber espionage against U.S. businesses is adding tension between the governments of the world’s two largest economies, Obama’s National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon said in a March 11 speech in New York. In their letter, Levin and Rangel cited a February report by Mandiant Corp., an Arlington, Virginia-based information security firm, that concluded the Chinese government is probably the source of recent hacking attacks. The lawmakers asked the USTR to list China in the annual assessment of intellectual property rights protection and enforcement in other nations, to be released about April 30. “We have received the letter and are reviewing it,” Carol Guthrie , a USTR spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The USTR will seek to toughen trade-secret protection through the annual assessment, the Obama administration said its strategy to mitigate violations, released in February. Intellectual-property protection is among the issues being negotiated as the U.S. seeks trade deals with 10 Pacific-region governments and the 27-nation European Union. Companies including New York-based Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) rely on enforcement of trade laws to protect their patents. Intellectual-property provisions shouldn’t be in a proposed U.S.-EU trade deal because they could raise health-care costs, limit free speech and restrict access to education materials, Washington-based consumer group Public Citizen said in a March 18 statement joined by other organizations. IP Moves Wilson Sonsini Expands IP Practice With Team of Five From Sidley Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati PC expanded its IP practice with the hiring of five patent litigators, the Palo Alto, California-based firm said in a statement.

The U.S. Trade Representative’s office needs to designate China as a top violator of intellectual property rights, which can lead to further trade restrictions, Representatives Sander Levin of Michigan and Charles Rangel of New York said March 28 in a letter to Acting USTR Demetrios Marantis. “In the case of China, the government itself appears to be actively stealing the intellectual property of American businesses,” the lawmakers, ranking Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, which deals with trade issues, wrote. China’s cyber espionage against U.S. businesses is adding tension between the governments of the world’s two largest economies, Obama’s National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon said in a March 11 speech in New York. In their letter, Levin and Rangel cited a February report by Mandiant Corp., an Arlington, Virginia-based information security firm, that concluded the Chinese government is probably the source of recent hacking attacks. The lawmakers asked the USTR to list China in the annual assessment of intellectual property rights protection and enforcement in other nations, to be released about April 30. “We have received the letter and are reviewing it,” Carol Guthrie , a USTR spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The USTR will seek to toughen trade-secret protection through the annual assessment, the Obama administration said its strategy to mitigate violations, released in February. Intellectual-property protection is among the issues being negotiated as the U.S. seeks trade deals with 10 Pacific-region governments and the 27-nation European Union. Companies including New York-based Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) rely on enforcement of trade laws to protect their patents. Intellectual-property provisions shouldn’t be in a proposed U.S.-EU trade deal because they could raise health-care costs, limit free speech and restrict access to education materials, Washington-based consumer group Public Citizen said in a March 18 statement joined by other organizations. IP Moves Wilson Sonsini Expands IP Practice With Team of Five From Sidley Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati PC expanded its IP practice with the hiring of five patent litigators, the Palo Alto, California-based firm said in a statement. The five new hires all previously were with Chicago’s Sidley Austin LLP. They are Edward Poplawski, Vera Elson, Paul Tripodi II, Olivia M. Kim and Sandra S. Fujiyama. Poplawski , who headed Sidley’s West Coast IP practice, has litigated life-sciences and technology patent cases in federal courts and before the International Trade Commission, a Washington-based entity with the power to exclude imports of products that infringe U.S. intellectual property. He has an undergraduate degree and a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Drexel University and a law degree from Villanova University. Elson has previously practiced at Wilson Sonsini and at Chicago’s McDermott Will & Emery LLP. Before she was a lawyer, she was an electrical engineer at Hughes Aircraft’s Advanced Circuit Technology Labs. She has an undergraduate degree in cybernetics and a master’s degree in engineering from the University of California at Los Angeles and a law degree from the University of Southern California. Tripodi has practiced in both federal court and before the International Trade Commission. He has an undergraduate degree in chemistry from Pennsylvania State University, a master’s degree in chemical physics from the California Institute of Technology and a law degree from the University of California at Los Angeles. Kim has represented clients whose technologies have included biometric sensors, computer processor architecture, Internet payment systems and plasma display panels. She was a researcher at the University of California’s immunology and physiology labs before she became a lawyer.

"Banks to Sell $40 Billion of Assets Amid European Debt Crisis, KPMG Says",['Anne-Sylvaine Chassany'],2011-10-06 23:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/banks-to-sell-40b-of-assets-amid-eu-crisis.html,"European banks are planning to sell more than 30 billion euros ($40 billion) of assets as the debt crisis increases the need to raise capital, according KPMG LLP. European lenders are accelerating asset sales after disposing of more than 26 billion euros of loans this year, according to a KPMG study released today. While the amount has been far from the “flurry of activity that was widely expected,” regulatory pressures and a deepening of the European debt crisis is forcing lenders to accept lower prices, the report said. “Counter-intuitively, we saw a lower-than-expected level of bank disposals of loan portfolios in the first few years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,” said Andrew Jenke, director in KPMG’s Portfolio Solutions Group. “But we are now starting to see banks - faced with the triple- whammy of sovereign debt crises, increased capital requirements and a funding mismatch - under a lot more pressure to extract value from their loan books.” Banks including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) and Dexia SA (DEXB) , the French-Belgian bank that is facing a second government bailout in three years, are planning to sell assets because they are under pressure from regulators to shrink their balance sheets and boost liquidity. Lured by the prospect of buying portfolios at a discount, U.S. private-equity firms and hedge funds have raised more than $5 billion for funds targeting European distressed assets and corporate turnarounds compared with about $400 million during the 2002 recession, according to London-based researcher Preqin Ltd. Deals have been slow to materialize because lenders aren’t willing to sell at the discounts sought by investors. ‘Gap Is Narrowing’ “The pricing gap is still there,” Jenke said. “Banks are still expecting more than purchasers are able to pay for the assets. This gap is narrowing in some instances.” The U.K. and Irish banks remain the biggest sellers, according to KPMG. RBS agreed in July to sell part of a 1.4 billion-pound ($2.2 billion) portfolio of commercial loans to Blackstone Group LP. (BX)  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) is selling a 6 billion-pound portfolio of shipping loans, according to the report. Anglo Irish Bank Corp. said in August it expects to complete the sale of $9.65 billion of U.S. real-estate loans. Funds Being Raised Apollo Global Management LLC, Leon Black’s private-equity firm, is seeking to raise $2.8 billion for a fund to buy European loans, two people with knowledge of the matter said in August. Oaktree Capital Management LP, the Los Angeles-based private-equity firm led by Howard Marks , is seeking as much as $3 billion for a fund that will buy assets in Europe , people with knowledge of the plans said previously. Hedge funds including New York-based Anchorage Capital Group LLC and Marathon Asset Management LP are also targeting Europe. Asset sales should accelerate in Spain , KPMG said. “The hottest topic over the past six months has been Spain,” the report said. “Local banks are seeking to shed non- core and non-performing loans and the impact of the caja restructuring is now starting to yield portfolio disposals.” To contact the reporter on this story: Anne-Sylvaine Chassany in Paris at  achassany@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Edward Evans at  eevans3@bloomberg.net",['Anne-Sylvaine Chassany'],"Banks to Sell $40 Billion of Assets Amid European Debt Crisis, KPMG Says European banks are planning to sell more than 30 billion euros ($40 billion) of assets as the debt crisis increases the need to raise capital, according KPMG LLP.

Volksbanken, whose decade-long, fivefold balance sheet expansion unraveled since 2008, will focus on supporting local cooperative banks under a plan negotiated with the EU, the Brussels-based European Commission said in a statement today. The lender will stop large corporate and real estate financing and subsidiaries not focused on the support functions. “I welcome the bank’s objective to focus on its core business of providing services to the local and regional” credit cooperatives, European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in the statement. “Making sure that banks that received state aid throughout the EU change their business model will help build a healthier financial sector.” Austria has spent about 12 billion euros ($15.6 billion) to bail out or support its banks since 2008 and has been told by ratings companies Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s that lenders are the biggest risk to its sovereign creditworthiness. The Alpine nation may miss its 2012 budget target because of additional capital needs at nationalized banks this year. Biggest Hole Volksbanken is responsible for the biggest chunk of taxpayer aid. Its Kommunalkredit unit, then co-owned by Franco- Belgian Dexia SA (DEXB) , was nationalized in 2008 and has since required capital and guarantees of 2.2 billion euros.

Egyptian Crackdown on Mursi Supporters Leaves Dozens Dead,['Maram Mazen' 'Maher Chmaytelli'],2013-07-27 08:59:02,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/egypt-orders-mursi-detained-for-links-to-hamas-militants.html,"Dozens of supporters of ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi were killed in clashes with police as the new rulers seek to consolidate control over the country and put an end to attacks on the armed forces. In Cairo, 75 pro-Mursi Egyptians were killed yesterday and early today and more than 1,000 injured, the state-run Middle East News Agency said. Most were shot, MENA said, citing medics at a field hospital in Rabaa el-Adawiya Square, where Mursi’s Muslim Brotherhood backers have held rallies since he was ousted by the military and detained on July 3. The Health Ministry said violence in the square itself during the early hours of today left 20 dead and 177 injured, MENA reported. Egyptian judicial authorities yesterday extended Mursi’s detention for 15 days after accusing him of conspiring with the Palestinian militant group Hamas in murders, abductions, jailbreaks and other attacks on the country’s security buildings, MENA said. The military said the day before that it would use new tactics against violence and terrorism starting today, without giving details. “What’s happening right now is an ugly massacre,” Omar Talaat, a doctor at the field hospital, told al-Jazeera TV. As the military’s deadline loomed, thousands of Mursi backers rallied in Cairo and other cities including Alexandria, while tens of thousands of his opponents met in the capital’s Tahrir Square and near the presidential palace. The gatherings yesterday followed a call the previous day by military chief Abdelfatah al-Seesi for Egyptians to take to the streets to give the armed forces and police a broad mandate to combat violence. ‘Reframe Conflict’ Al-Seesi’s request for Egyptians to rally was “designed to reframe the conflict with the Muslim Brotherhood as a war on terror,” Hani Sabra, Middle East director at the Eurasia Group in New York , said in an e-mailed statement. Mursi’s backers vowed today to press ahead with their demonstrations against what they call a “coup.” “The massacres and crimes committed against the free Egyptian people will not scare them and they will continue to protest peacefully until the coup is reversed and coup-ist leaders are brought to justice,” the Anti-Coup Alliance, comprising Brotherhood members and Islamist parties, said today in a statement in English. Mursi has been held at an undisclosed location since his ouster, which followed street protests against his rule by those who accused him of pursuing an Islamist agenda. His supporters have held daily demonstrations since his removal by the army, demanding the former president’s reinstatement. Before the latest violence, almost 100 people had died in clashes since Mursi was deposed. Palace Rally Thousands gathered yesterday by the presidential palace in Heliopolis, site of one of the rallies called by al-Seesi, as military helicopters hovered above. People waved Egyptian flags and carried posters of al-Seesi while chanting “Come down Seesi, you’re our president.” “He wanted the authority and we’re giving it to him,” said 26-year-old Ayman Rizkalla. “ Egypt is for all of us, not just the Islamists who were taking us to hell.” The unrest has roiled the country’s markets. Yields on Egypt’s 5.75 percent bonds maturing April 2020 rose 4 basis points to 8.60 percent yesterday, bringing this week’s increase to 15 basis points, the most in a month. Detaining “a legitimate president” without the presence of his lawyers “shows the nature of the military regime,” Essam El-Erian, vice chairman of the Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party, said yesterday on his Facebook page. Brotherhood’s Opponents Opponents of the Brotherhood, including youth groups and secular-leaning parties, accuse Islamists of deadly violence, including a surge in attacks by militants in the Sinai peninsula against military and police positions. Several armed supporters of Mursi were detained this week as they tried to attack a rival sit-in in Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak , state-run media reported. Clashes in Alexandria yesterday left seven people dead, Ahram Gate reported, citing Khalid el-Khatib, a senior official at the Health Ministry. A total of nine people were killed nationwide yesterday, MENA said. Police clashed with Mursi’s supporters in Cairo when they tried to block key roads serving the capital, the news agency said. ‘Increasingly Untenable’ “It’s becoming increasingly untenable for president Mursi to be detained for almost a month now without being charged with anything,” putting pressure on the authorities to announce a judicial process has begun, Yasser el-Shimy, a Cairo-based analyst with the International Crisis Group , said yesterday by phone. “It’s likely to inflame the sentiments of the pro-Mursi crowd.” Mursi was accused of escaping and assisting others to escape from Wadi al-Natrun jail, where he was detained before the 2011 uprising, according to a judicial statement yesterday. He was questioned over the allegations and was presented with evidence, MENA said. President Barack Obama ’s administration, in a move that may protect U.S. aid to Egypt, has concluded that it doesn’t have to make a formal determination on whether Mursi’s ouster was a coup, a State Department official said. Making such a determination, which potentially would have required cutting off aid, wouldn’t be in the U.S. national interest, State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said yesterday. Egypt is a stabilizing force in the region, and it’s to the U.S.’s advantage to continue providing aid, she said. Obama had asked U.S. agencies on July 3 to review whether Mursi’s removal required halting about $1.5 billion in U.S. aid, of which $1.3 billion is military assistance. A U.S. law requires the denial of “any assistance to the government of any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by a military coup d’etat or decree,” or a coup “in which the military plays a decisive role.” “Our national security interests influence our policy as it relates to aid with Egypt,” Psaki told reporters at a State Department briefing. “We reviewed the legal obligations and determined we did not need to make a determination one way or the other.” To contact the reporters on this story: Maher Chmaytelli in Dubai at  mchmaytelli@bloomberg.net ; Maram Mazen in Cairo at  mmazen@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Dick Schumacher at  dschumacher@bloomberg.net",['Maram MazenMaher Chmaytelli'],"Egyptian Crackdown on Mursi Supporters Leaves Dozens Dead Dozens of supporters of ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi were killed in clashes with police as the new rulers seek to consolidate control over the country and put an end to attacks on the armed forces.

President Barack Obama ’s administration, in a move that may protect U.S. aid to Egypt, has concluded that it doesn’t have to make a formal determination on whether Mursi’s ouster was a coup, a State Department official said. Making such a determination, which potentially would have required cutting off aid, wouldn’t be in the U.S. national interest, State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said yesterday. Egypt is a stabilizing force in the region, and it’s to the U.S.’s advantage to continue providing aid, she said. Obama had asked U.S. agencies on July 3 to review whether Mursi’s removal required halting about $1.5 billion in U.S. aid, of which $1.3 billion is military assistance. A U.S. law requires the denial of “any assistance to the government of any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by a military coup d’etat or decree,” or a coup “in which the military plays a decisive role.” “Our national security interests influence our policy as it relates to aid with Egypt,” Psaki told reporters at a State Department briefing. “We reviewed the legal obligations and determined we did not need to make a determination one way or the other.” To contact the reporters on this story: Maher Chmaytelli in Dubai at  mchmaytelli@bloomberg.net ; Maram Mazen in Cairo at  mmazen@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Dick Schumacher at  dschumacher@bloomberg.net",6514,1026,57,43.17530137120471,8,5,True,30,7,3,False,False,5.346003898635478,-1,0,-1,-1,negative,0.5795572996139526,sadness,0.5795572996139526,negative,0.8871475458145142,,0,
Goldman Names 266 Managing Directors in Annual Promotion,['Christine Harper'],2012-11-15 18:45:30,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/goldman-names-266-managing-directors-in-annual-promotion.html,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) promoted 266 employees to managing director, up from 261 last year, as the fifth-biggest U.S. bank seeks to reward staff even as it pares expenses. The annual promotions, which take effect Jan. 1, come one day after New York-based Goldman Sachs named 70 people to its so-called partnership, the fewest since the firm became a public company in 1999. Partners, also called participating managing directors, receive a higher salary than managing directors and share in a special bonus pool. Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, has undertaken a $1.9 billion expense-reduction effort since the middle of last year as higher capital requirements and weak revenue growth cut return on equity. The company employed 32,600 people at the end of September, 3,100 fewer than at the end of 2010. The investment bank expects that 7.2 percent of employees will be managing directors at the start of 2013, unchanged from a year earlier, according to Michael DuVally , a Goldman Sachs spokesman. Managing directors typically receive a base salary of $500,000, lower than the $900,000 granted to partners. Both also get bonuses that can boost their total compensation into the millions of dollars. Geographical Mix The number of employees named managing director is down from a record 321 in 2010. About 58 percent of those just promoted are based in the Americas, 26 percent in Europe , Middle East and Africa, and 17 percent in Asia, DuVally said. Last year, about 46 percent were in the Americas, 30 percent in EMEA and 23 percent in Asia. Women comprise 23 percent of the incoming class of managing directors, up from 19 percent in 2011 and down from 24 percent in 2010. The firm said yesterday that 10 of the 70 new partners, or 14 percent, are women. Goldman Sachs, which announced today’s promotions in a statement, created the non-partner managing director title in 1996 to recognize top employees who weren’t yet partners. That first class of 87 managing directors included William C. Dudley, now president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ; Clifford S. Asness, who left in 1998 to start hedge fund AQR Capital Management LLC; and Richard J. Gnodde, who was named co-head of global investment banking at Goldman Sachs in May 2011.

Christie Relying on Web Bets for N.J. Budget Seen as Risk,['Terrence Dopp'],2013-03-11 00:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/christie-relying-on-web-bets-for-n-j-budget-seen-as-risk.html,"Governor Chris Christie is betting New Jersey’s new online-gambling law will propel an 85 percent jump in casino-tax collections next fiscal year. He faces a skeptical group of analysts and lawmakers. The governor’s 2014 budget anticipates a $1.2 billion market from Internet bets in its first year. Analysts at Moody’s Investors Service, Deutsche Bank AG and Bloomberg Industries all say that sounds too optimistic, with their estimates ranging from $250 million to about $850 million. Christie, a 50-year-old Republican seeking a second term, missed his target for more than 8 percent revenue growth this year as sales, corporate and casino revenue fell short, forcing him to abandon an income-tax cut. Next year he’s counting on a smaller 4.9 percent gain, which depends in part on Internet wagers taking off to help Atlantic City rebound from six straight years of decline. “You have to be realistic, and I’d think by this time he’d err on the side of caution,” said Assembly Budget Chairman Vincent Prieto, a Democrat from Secaucus. “If he doesn’t make those numbers, clearly we are going to have to cut somewhere in the middle of next year.” Christie has made an Atlantic City revival a centerpiece of his first term, saying casinos are crucial to New Jersey ’s economic recovery. He created state-run tourism districts and extended $261 million in tax credits to jump-start development of the first new casino in nine years, by Revel Entertainment Group LLC. Revel opened in April, failed to meet earnings expectations and is planning a prepackaged bankruptcy to erase more than $1 billion in debt. Below Targets The governor’s $32.9 billion spending plan, the final one of his first term, will take effect four months before Election Day. His budget would delay property-tax rebates to close the current year’s deficit as he increases spending on schools and pensions, and expands Medicaid. A year ago, Christie proposed a budget that predicted the state’s collections from the 8 percent tax on Atlantic City ’s casinos would jump 16 percent in fiscal 2013, which began July 1. Through February, that revenue was 28 percent below target. Christie, who vetoed Internet betting in 2011, reversed course this year and legalized it to fend off competition from nearby states that have expanded gambling. His authorization set off a national horse race over an online market that’s forecast to reach $7.4 billion in five years. ‘Long Shot’ “It’s a long shot,” said Gene Johnson, a senior vice president at Spectrum Gaming Group LLC, a casino research and consulting firm in Linwood, New Jersey. “I can’t see them reaching that $1.2 billion figure.” New Jersey became the most populous state to legalize online gambling, following action by Nevada and Delaware. Other states may follow after a 2011 Justice Department opinion said the Federal Wire Act, which prohibits the use of wires to transfer bets, applies only to sporting events or contests, said Brian C. Miller and Tim Craighead, gaming analysts for Bloomberg Industries. Delaware probably will be the first to roll out online gaming, by September, while Nevada may follow by year-end, said Andrew Zarnett, a gaming analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. In Pennsylvania , whose Philadelphia-area casinos have siphoned gamblers from Atlantic City, Representative Tina Davis, a Bristol Democrat, plans to introduce a bill to establish Internet gambling this week. Two Years Implementation in New Jersey may take as long as two years, Zarnett estimated in a Feb. 28 report. Gary Loveman, chief executive officer of Caesars Entertainment (CZR) Co., gave a similar time frame during a Feb. 25 conference call. Delaware estimates an additional $9 million of tax revenue from online betting in its first full fiscal year after implementation, according to Moody’s. Christie is expecting to collect $180 million from a 15 percent tax on online casino revenue in fiscal 2014, according to his budget summary. Miller and Craighead estimate that online gambling would result in $128 million of state taxes, though only if fully rolled out by July 1. “He is in trouble,” Senator Raymond Lesniak, an Elizabeth Democrat who sponsored New Jersey’s online gambling bill, said of Christie’s forecast. Lesniak said he projects first-year tax collections of about $45 million, based on operators posting about $300 million in revenue. Being Kind “I’m being kind when I say optimistic -- I mean unrealistic,” Lesniak said. “I just don’t see how a couple of hundred million dollars going into the state treasury can be reached. And I’m the main proponent of this.” Casinos account for more than two-thirds of the tax base in Atlantic City, where a quarter of its 40,000 residents live in poverty. The seaside city was a bustling resort until the 1960s, when it became riddled with crime and corruption. The state approved casinos in 1976 to boost the city’s ailing finances. The $2.6 billion Revel has fallen short of its own expectations, ranking next to last in January gambling revenue among the city’s 12 casinos, the state reported Feb. 11. Under the bankruptcy agreement with lenders, the casino will restructure to erase more than $1 billion in debt. Christie also signed a law last year to allow wagering on professional and college sports in Atlantic City and at racetracks. A federal judge this month ruled against the governor, siding with groups including the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the National Football League that sued to block the legislation from taking effect. Sports Books Sports-book wagers account for one-third of the $30 billion Internet gaming industry, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, Christie said his budget projections weren’t counting on sports wagering. “Our revenue projections were based upon the institution of Internet gaming and what we think will be a generally better nature of the economy in the next year which will lead to more people having more disposable income and gambling more,” Christie told reporters on March 4 in Jersey City. Christie said March 4 that the state will file an appeal of the court ruling and that he anticipates the case will take two years to be resolved before the U.S. Supreme Court. “Without sports betting, I don’t see New Jersey getting to a billion-dollar industry, especially not in the next five years,” said Spectrum’s Johnson. “I’m not going to say that I understand the governor’s thought process.” To contact the reporter on this story: Terrence Dopp in Trenton at  tdopp@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephen Merelman at  smerelman@bloomberg.net",['Terrence Dopp'],"Christie Relying on Web Bets for N.J.

"ECB Says Economists Cut Growth Outlook, Raise Price Forecast",['Gabi Thesing'],2012-11-15 09:44:18,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/ecb-says-economists-cut-growth-outlook-raise-price-forecast-1-.html,"The European Central Bank said professional forecasters cut their estimates for the euro-area economy while raising their inflation expectations.

Forecasters lowered their estimate for 2013 growth to 0.3 percent from 0.6 percent and their projection for 2014 to 1.3 percent from 1.4 percent, the ECB said. Inflation is seen at 2.5 percent this year and 1.9 percent next year, up from 2.3 percent and 1.7 percent respectively. European policy makers are trying to contain a sovereign debt crisis that has pushed five countries into seeking bailouts and taken the 17-nation euro economy to the brink of recession. The ECB said the economic outlook for the euro area remains “weak” as the debt crisis undermines confidence. “It is essential for governments to support confidence by forcefully implementing the necessary steps to reduce both fiscal and structural imbalances and to proceed with financial sector restructuring,” the central bank said in its monthly bulletin today, which echoes President Mario Draghi ’s Nov. 8 policy statement. The ECB in September unveiled a new government bond purchasing program called Outright Monetary Transactions aimed at stemming surging borrowing costs in Spain and Italy. Yields have since fallen even though neither country has asked for the program to be activated. Still, “we are ready to undertake OMTs, which will help to avoid extreme scenarios, thereby clearly reducing concerns about the materialization of destructive forces,” the ECB said. Inflation risks are “broadly balanced” over the medium term and the inflation rate should fall below 2 percent, the ECB’s definition of price stability , “over the course of next year,” the ECB said.
