Strengths of Your Implementation
Your script demonstrates solid technical sophistication:

Robust preprocessing pipeline with proper text cleaning and normalization
Smart dimensionality reduction using UMAP/PCA before clustering, which should improve stability
Multi-modal keyword extraction combining TF-IDF with proper noun detection
Map-reduce summarization for handling long texts effectively
Comprehensive visualization with both overview and detailed views

The results show you successfully identified 55 distinct clusters from what appears to be financial/business news data spanning 2007-2013.
Areas for Critical Evaluation
However, there are some concerns about the clustering quality:
Cluster coherence issues: Looking at your CSV results, some clusters seem thematically mixed. For example:

Cluster 2 combines "Rugby World Cup" with general sports content
Cluster 45 mixes "Steve Jobs" with broader China/technology topics
Several clusters appear to be grouped more by publication patterns than semantic similarity

Potential over-clustering: With 55 clusters from your dataset, you might be splitting coherent themes unnecessarily. The minimum cluster size of 5 could be contributing to this fragmentation.
Keyword quality varies: Some clusters show clear, specific keywords (like "Steve Jobs, Apple" in cluster 45), while others have generic terms that don't clearly distinguish the theme.
Suggestions for Improvement

Experiment with clustering parameters - Try increasing min_cluster_size to 8-10 and see if you get more coherent themes
Validate cluster quality - Consider adding silhouette analysis or other clustering metrics
Post-processing refinement - You might benefit from a second-pass clustering or manual cluster merging for very similar themes
Semantic validation - Test whether articles within clusters are actually more similar to each other than to articles in other clusters

The visualization suggests your dimensional reduction is working well - you can see clear cluster separation. The technical implementation appears sound, but the semantic quality of the clusters might benefit from parameter tuning or additional validation steps.
