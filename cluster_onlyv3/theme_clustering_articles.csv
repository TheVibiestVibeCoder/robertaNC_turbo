Irish Trophy Home Plunges 75% in Price as Property Millionaires Disappear,['Finbarr Flynn' 'Neil Callanan'],2011-10-07 12:16:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/irish-trophy-homes-lose-allure-as-property-millions-disappear.html,"A six-bedroom Edwardian house on Ireland’s most expensive street is on the market for one quarter of the price paid when it was bought six years ago, a sign that the country’s property crash isn’t sparing high-end properties. Walford, a house on Shrewsbury Road in Dublin’s affluent embassy belt, previously sold for 58 million euros ($77 million), according to Savills Plc (SVS) , which is offering the empty home for 15 million euros. Interested buyers need to submit bids for the house by Oct. 27 with a 1 million-euro bank draft. Prices for some of Ireland’s trophy homes fell at least as much as the rest of the country’s slumping market after the real-estate collapse drained the fortunes of property-boom millionaires. Thorndene, another house on Shrewsbury Road in Dublin’s Ballsbridge, is on the market for 8 million euros, down from an asking price of 14 million euros in 2009. Prime property prices rose faster than the rest of the market during Ireland’s boom “because there was a lot of people chasing too few properties, which gave them a spike,” said Wade Wise of Beirne & Wise, who has been selling Irish high -end homes for 12 years. “Come the crash, they’ve fallen further.” In property markets including London and Paris, luxury home prices fell less following the financial crisis and recovered more quickly than the broader market on tight supply and investment from abroad. Prices in London neighborhoods such as Knightsbridge and St. John’s Wood exceed their pre-recession peaks. Worse Than Average While prices in Dublin have fallen more than 50 percent on average, top end values are down about 75 percent, Wise said. “The drivers of the bubble, especially those who came in later, tend to be among the bigger victims,” said economist Brian Lucey, an associate finance professor at Trinity College Dublin. Ireland was “unique” because the newly made millionaires chose to buy luxury homes in the country rather than abroad. Luxury home prices during the property boom were “underpinned by wealth that wasn’t really wealth,” he said. Investment in housing rose to almost 15 percent of Ireland’s gross domestic product in 2006, up from about 6 percent in 1996, according to the country’s Economic & Social Research Institute. A home formerly owned by Derek Quinlan, once one of Ireland’s richest men, near Shrewsbury Road may be sold to the Belgian Embassy, said two people with knowledge of the matter. The price range is 2.5 million euros to 2.9 million euros, said one of the people, who declined to be identified because the talks aren’t concluded. Quinlan bought the house in 2006 for 7 million euros, and spent more refurbishing it, the Irish Times reported in March, without citing anyone. Damage Done “In Ireland it always used to be a cycle, but this time we seem to have done a lot of damage so the natural recovery isn’t there,” said real-estate developer Paddy Kelly, who owned three houses on Shrewsbury Road at different times and has now lost control of some of his assets as prices plunged. The identity of Walford’s owner hasn’t been disclosed. Iris Keating an agent at Savills, which is jointly handling the sale with Irish broker Lisney, said it received instructions to sell the house from the trust Matsack Nominees Ltd. While luxury cars crowd the driveways of Walford’s neighbors, the red-brick house is run down after being left uninhabited for more than six years. Visitors step onto a bare cement floor just inside the entrance. The walls have been stripped, wooden floors are exposed and cobwebs hang in some of the rooms of the house. ‘Best Road’ After the 75 percent discount, Walford is drawing expressions of interest from potential buyers, Keating said. “This is the best road in Dublin,” she said. “We have had number of genuine inquiries from people who we know to be serious at this end of the market.” Telecom billionaire Denis O’Brien owns a home in Ballsbridge, about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) south of the city center. The Belgian embassy is on the street, as is the residence of the Finnish ambassador. Paddy Kelly is currently leasing a property on Shrewsbury Road to the Chinese embassy. Residential house prices in Dublin have fallen by 51 percent since the peak of the property boom, according to Ireland’s statistics office. The government took control of five of the country’s six biggest lenders, after real-estate loans soured. In all, Ireland has injected or pledged about 62 billion euros to shore up the financial system. Further to Fall Average house prices may fall as much as 70 percent from the peak if the government doesn’t take action to ensure lenders provide mortgages, according to Ronan Lyons , an economist based at Oxford University who has written on the Irish property market. “There is a huge problem at the moment with the availability of credit,” Lyons said in an interview. “Banks are trying to cut down their loan books, not increase them.” Keating at Savills still expects Walford to sell. She estimates that 1 million euros needs to be spent renovating the property. “There are some people who will compete to have a trophy residence here even now,” said Keating at Savills, without naming any of the interested parties. “People at this end of the market want to keep their business under the radar.” To contact the reporters on this story: Finbarr Flynn in Dublin at  fflynn3@bloomberg.net ; Neil Callanan in London at  ncallanan@bloomberg.net ; To contact the editor responsible for this story: Colin Keatinge at  ckeatinge@bloomberg.net",['Finbarr FlynnNeil Callanan'],"Irish Trophy Home Plunges 75% in Price as Property Millionaires Disappear A six-bedroom Edwardian house on Ireland’s most expensive street is on the market for one quarter of the price paid when it was bought six years ago, a sign that the country’s property crash isn’t sparing high-end properties.

SEC Claims Author Used Ponzi Scheme to Repay Prior Fraud Victims,['Joshua Gallu'],2011-10-06 22:28:34,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/sec-gets-court-order-to-halt-alleged-26-million-ponzi-scheme.html,"Eric J. Aronson, a New York man who wrote a self-help book after pleading guilty to fraud more than a decade ago, was accused by U.S. regulators today of operating a $26 million Ponzi scheme in which he used investor funds to pay court-ordered restitution to victims of his earlier fraud. Aronson, 43, lured about 140 people to buy promissory notes from companies he controlled including PermaPave Industries LLC, touting returns of up to 33 percent on investments in natural- stone pavers imported from Australia , the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a complaint filed today in Manhattan. U.S. attorneys filed related criminal charges against Aronson today, the SEC said. Aronson and other executives used new investor funds collected between 2006 and 2010 to make payments to earlier customers and siphoned off money to buy themselves luxury cars, jewelry and gambling trips to Las Vegas , according to the complaint. Aronson, who penned the 2007 book “DASH” with a first chapter entitled “The Buffet of Life,” misappropriated about $2.6 million through two other companies he solely controlled, using the money to pay back victims of a scheme to which he pleaded guilty in 2000, the SEC said. Randy Zelin, an attorney for Aronson and PermaPave , declined immediate comment. Aronson and his associates “created the facade of a profitable business, promised investors extraordinary rates of return, and used much of their investors’ money to fund their own lavish lifestyle,” George Canellos, head of the SEC’s New York office, said in a statement. The SEC is seeking to bar Aronson from serving as an officer or director of a public company, as well as the return of illicit profits and unspecified fines.

DuPont Calls at Two-Year High as Traders See Rebound: Options,['Cecile Vannucci' 'Jeff Kearns'],2011-10-06 20:27:07,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/dupont-calls-at-two-year-high-as-traders-see-rebound-options.html,"DuPont Co. options traders are more bullish than any time in two years, betting the stock will rebound from a five-month decline as investors favor companies with the highest dividends. The ratio of outstanding puts to sell versus calls to buy has dropped to 0.8, the lowest since April 2009. Ownership of contracts to buy the shares through Oct. 21 for $44, or 6.8 percent above the stock price, surged almost 27-fold in the past month, the most among options on Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The shares have fallen 27 percent to $41.21 since peaking this year on April 29. Concern policy makers may be running out of tools to keep the global slowdown from worsening has boosted demand for companies with the highest payouts. DuPont shares yield 3.98 percent, fifth-most in the S&P 500 Materials Index. It has a quarterly dividend of 41 cents a share, last raised in the final three months of 2007. Since the market peaked April 29, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index has lost 9.7 percent, compared with the S&P 500’s loss of 15 percent including payouts. “People like large-cap, dividend-paying stocks like DuPont particularly in this environment where there’s a lot of uncertainty,” Jake Dollarhide, who helps manage $70 million including DuPont shares at Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma , said in a telephone interview yesterday. “The fears about Europe aren’t helping, but short of Greek default I’d look for things to get back to normal in next two or three months.” Calls Rise DuPont had 199,697 outstanding calls and 160,246 puts as of Oct. 4, according to Bloomberg data. The ratio of calls to puts dropped 31 percent since Aug. 19, the biggest slide among all 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average companies. Call open interest on Sept. 15, before options expired last month, was 204,788, the most since August 1999. Michael Hanretta , a DuPont spokesman, declined to comment. The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index is known, jumped a record 160 percent during the third quarter as concern grew the global economy was slowing and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe was worsening. The volatility gauge fell 4.1 percent to 36.27 today. In Europe, the VStoxx Index, which measures the cost of protecting against Euro Stoxx 50 Index losses, dropped 6.5 percent to 42.63. All 10 DuPont contracts with the biggest increase in ownership in the past two weeks were calls. Open interest for October $44 calls rose to 9,303 contracts from 487 contracts, the largest gain. January $50 calls had the biggest open interest among all DuPont options. ‘Stands Out’ “It stands out as an area of interest for traders,” Henry Schwartz , president of Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based provider of options-market data and analytics, said in a telephone interview yesterday. “Traders appear to consider ownership of these upside calls to be a good risk/reward.” DuPont has bought four companies in the past year, Bloomberg data show, including Copenhagen-based Danisco A/S, the biggest producer of food additives. It’s expanding by opening new facilities and adding jobs. Ellen Kullman , the chief executive officer, said in an Oct. 4 interview with Carol Massar on Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart” that “agriculture around the world is still doing really well,” and “automotive is growing.” DuPont, the world’s largest maker of titanium dioxide, is investing in agriculture, electronics and safety and protection units to boost per-share earnings about 12 percent a year through 2015. The company paid 41 billion kroner ($7.3 billion) in June for Danisco. This year, DuPont is opening at least two plants in the U.S., Kullman said in the interview. Cars, Food Prices Industrywide light-vehicle sales ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 13.1 million in September, the highest since April, according to Autodata Corp. Global food prices will probably stay at high levels this year because of a lack of stockpiles, the United Nations said last month. DuPont could extend declines if the global economy continues to deteriorate. The International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for worldwide growth next year to 4 percent from 4.5 percent on Sept. 20, predicting “severe” repercussions if Europe fails to contain its debt crisis or U.S. policy makers deadlock over a fiscal plan. The company raised its full-year earnings forecast to between $3.90 and $4.05 a share on July 28, up from $3.65 to $3.85, excluding its acquisition of Danisco. That compared with the average analyst estimate of $3.98. DuPont has exceeded estimates in each of the 10 quarters since Kullman became CEO. Contrasts With Rivals Greater bullishness about DuPont contrasts with the company’s rivals. The put-to-call ratio for St. Louis-based Monsanto Co. (MON) , the world’s largest seed company, rose 22 percent to 0.79 between Aug. 19 and Oct. 4, Bloomberg data show. The ratio for Midland, Michigan-based Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the largest U.S. chemical maker, gained 25 percent since Sept. 15 to 1.04. “With record profits and zero cost for capital, with low interest rates and cheaper energy costs, there are a number of bullish factors lining up,” Alan Knuckman, chief market strategist at OneStopOption.com, a Chicago-based provider of options market analysis, said in a telephone interview yesterday. “The companies that are going to benefit from that are large conglomerates like this one as a default, because investment money has to move somewhere.” To contact the reporters on this story: Cecile Vannucci in Amsterdam at  cvannucci1@bloomberg.net ; Jeff Kearns in New York at  jkearns3@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Baker at  nbaker7@bloomberg.net ; Andrew Rummer at  arummer@bloomberg.net",['Cecile VannucciJeff Kearns'],"DuPont Calls at Two-Year High as Traders See Rebound: Options DuPont Co. options traders are more bullish than any time in two years, betting the stock will rebound from a five-month decline as investors favor companies with the highest dividends.

Merkel Diverges From Sarkozy on Greek Default Threat to Banks: Euro Credit,['James Hertling' 'Tony Czuczka'],2011-10-07 09:51:53,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/merkel-sarkozy-divided-on-default-threat-to-banks-euro-credit.html,"Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy are running out of road. Whether to allow Greece to default and how to manage the fallout, questions they have tried to avoid for more than a year, may finally require answers as European officials turn to fortifying banks and consider ways of easing Greece’s debt load. It costs $6 million plus $100,000 a year to insure $10 million of Greek securities for five years, with credit-insurance prices pointing to a 91 percent chance of default. As the German chancellor and French president prepare to meet in two days for their eighth bilateral summit in 20 months, Merkel has cited the need to prepare for the default that investors see as a sure thing. Sarkozy, whose banks have the most to lose, is unwilling to gamble on letting Greece go. “The whole German debate about a default of Greece is a German debate, not a European debate,” said Stefan Collignon, a former German Finance Ministry official and political economist at the Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa, Italy. “The commitment everywhere else, including in France, is very much to avoid that by all possible means.” The heads of Europe’s two biggest economies, along with their finance chiefs, meet in Berlin on Oct. 9 with the euro near a nine-month low against the dollar. French 10-year bonds yield 78 basis points more than their German equivalents, near the euro-era record set Aug. 8. Investors are demanding a premium of 21.4 percentage points to hold Greek 10-year bonds over benchmark German bunds of similar maturity. The leaders will discuss banks’ finances in their Berlin talks, Sarkozy told reporters in Yerevan, Armenia , declining to comment further on the crisis. Credit Ratings The leaders’ contrasting approaches on Greece may reflect the relative vulnerability of their top credit ratings and economies. France ’s AAA rating and its banks are on the front line of potential damage, while German exposure to Greek debt is smaller. Credit-default swaps on Germany have almost doubled this year to reach a high of 121 basis points Oct. 4. French CDS exceeded 200 basis points last month. Higher prices indicate greater risk. “Sarkozy is obviously the weaker partner,” Carsten Brzeski , an economist at ING Group in Brussels, said in a phone interview. Even so, “Merkel needs Sarkozy’s support on the debt restructuring issue, not necessarily that it’s going to happen now, but that it’s going to happen sometime.” Already the biggest contributor to bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, Merkel may not offer much in return when she hosts Sarkozy at the Chancellery. Last Resort She’s been stressing the limits of joint action, saying Oct. 5 that Europe’s rescue fund will only be used as a last resort to save banks and that investors may have to take deeper losses in a Greek rescue. Germany is also resisting discussion of leveraging the 440 billion-euro ($586 billion) fund to boost its firepower. European leaders are struggling to persuade investors they can stem the sovereign-debt woes as the crisis gnaws at the euro area’s core, prompting speculation of another government rescue of Dexia SA (DEXB) , the municipal lender bailed out by France and Belgium in 2008. Underscoring the risks, Moody’s Investors Service lowered Italy’s credit rating by three steps on Oct. 4 and warned that euro-area nations rated below the top Aaa level may have their rankings cut. Disagreements Since the crisis broke out in Greece in late 2009, Merkel and Sarkozy have differed on key points -- including the role of the International Monetary Fund in rescues, sanctions for countries that break deficit rules and how to make banks take losses to help rescue Greece -- before finding a way forward. Germany and France are at odds over whether the European Financial Stability Facility rescue fund should have limits on government bond purchases, Germany’s Handelsblatt newspaper reported today, citing an unidentified European Union diplomat. “Franco-German cooperation hasn’t worked well in terms of solving the crisis,” Paul De Grauwe, an economics professor at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, said in a phone interview. “The two have pursued different objectives.” As German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble urges euro- area counterparts to develop individual plans to protect their nations’ banks, Merkel is laying out the scenario of Greece defaulting without leaving the currency union she has vowed to preserve. ‘Barrier’ Needed “We have to be able to put up a barrier,” she said on Sept. 26. “I don’t rule out at all that at some point we will have the question of whether one can do an insolvency of states just like with banks.” She raised the specter of running out of time, patience and money on Oct. 5, prodding other EU governments to figure out whether banks need capital boosts. “Time is short,” she said. In contrast, Sarkozy has referred to Europe as a “family” that must stick together to support its weakest members. After hosting Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou at his Elysee Palace on Sept. 30, Sarkozy rejected daring the markets with an insolvency. “The failure of Greece would be the failure of all of Europe,” Sarkozy told reporters. “Remember in 2008, when the U.S. let Lehman Brothers fail, the global financial system paid the price. For both economic reasons and moral reasons, we can’t let Greece fail.” Greek Holdings Sarkozy, whose popularity is near a record low as he decides whether to seek a second term next year, has reasons for concern. At the end of March, French financial firms had $672 billion in public and private debt in Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain , according to Basel, Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements. That’s the biggest exposure to the euro-area’s troubled countries and almost a third more than German lenders. Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said last month that French banks don’t need recapitalization as Societe Generale (GLE) SA, BNP Paribas SA and Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , the country’s largest lenders, have announced plans to reinforce their capital by cutting assets. Merkel, who faced down two junior parties in her government that flirted with anti-bailout stances, won a victory last week when her coalition’s lawmakers passed an expansion of the EFSF that allows it to buy sovereign bonds in the secondary market and recapitalize banks. Euro Stability Merkel signaled that Germany’s largesse is now exhausted, saying Oct. 5 that the rescue fund’s new powers must only be used if the “stability of the euro as a whole” is at risk. Merkel and Sarkozy issued coordinated statements on Sept. 14 after a three-way phone call with Papandreou, saying they are “convinced” Greece will stay in the euro area. In focusing on Greece, Europe’s leaders are “asking the wrong question,” Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said yesterday in a speech in Ireland’s upper house of parliament. Europe should recapitalize banks to build a “financial firewall against contagion,” tackle Greek debt and then sort matters of governance, he said. “The question is what should Europe do about the euro zone, and if you answer that question then Greece falls into context,” Noonan said.

Whether to allow Greece to default and how to manage the fallout, questions they have tried to avoid for more than a year, may finally require answers as European officials turn to fortifying banks and consider ways of easing Greece’s debt load. It costs $6 million plus $100,000 a year to insure $10 million of Greek securities for five years, with credit-insurance prices pointing to a 91 percent chance of default. As the German chancellor and French president prepare to meet in two days for their eighth bilateral summit in 20 months, Merkel has cited the need to prepare for the default that investors see as a sure thing. Sarkozy, whose banks have the most to lose, is unwilling to gamble on letting Greece go. “The whole German debate about a default of Greece is a German debate, not a European debate,” said Stefan Collignon, a former German Finance Ministry official and political economist at the Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa, Italy. “The commitment everywhere else, including in France, is very much to avoid that by all possible means.” The heads of Europe’s two biggest economies, along with their finance chiefs, meet in Berlin on Oct. 9 with the euro near a nine-month low against the dollar. French 10-year bonds yield 78 basis points more than their German equivalents, near the euro-era record set Aug. 8. Investors are demanding a premium of 21.4 percentage points to hold Greek 10-year bonds over benchmark German bunds of similar maturity. The leaders will discuss banks’ finances in their Berlin talks, Sarkozy told reporters in Yerevan, Armenia , declining to comment further on the crisis. Credit Ratings The leaders’ contrasting approaches on Greece may reflect the relative vulnerability of their top credit ratings and economies. France ’s AAA rating and its banks are on the front line of potential damage, while German exposure to Greek debt is smaller. Credit-default swaps on Germany have almost doubled this year to reach a high of 121 basis points Oct. 4. French CDS exceeded 200 basis points last month. Higher prices indicate greater risk. “Sarkozy is obviously the weaker partner,” Carsten Brzeski , an economist at ING Group in Brussels, said in a phone interview. Even so, “Merkel needs Sarkozy’s support on the debt restructuring issue, not necessarily that it’s going to happen now, but that it’s going to happen sometime.” Already the biggest contributor to bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, Merkel may not offer much in return when she hosts Sarkozy at the Chancellery.

Jobs Rose From Computers in Parents’ Garage to Technology Icon: Timeline,['Joel Stonington'],2011-10-06 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/jobs-rose-from-parents-garage-to-technology-icon-timeline.html,"Steve Jobs was a college dropout who built computers in his parents’ garage in the mid-1970s with a friend, Steve Wozniak. They founded what is now Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 1976 to sell their creations. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, surpassed Microsoft Corp. in 2010 to become the world’s most valuable technology company. A timeline of Jobs’s career follows: Feb. 24, 1955: A boy is born in San Francisco to college graduate students Joanne Carole Schieble and Syrian immigrant Abdulfattah “John” Jandali. Jobs said in a 1997 New York Times Magazine article that he wouldn’t talk about his biological parents, citing privacy. He is adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs, who name him Steven Paul Jobs and raise him in the suburbs of Mountain View and Los Altos, California. 1972: Jobs graduates from Homestead High School, the Cupertino school that is also the alma mater of Wozniak, his future business partner. Jobs enrolls at Reed College in Portland , Oregon , and drops out after one semester. “The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting,” he said during a June 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University. 1974: Jobs returns to California and works as a designer at Atari Corp., the video-game company. He later travels to India in search of spiritual enlightenment. 1975: Jobs and Wozniak hang out at Homebrew Computer Club, an informal gathering of engineers and hobbyists who swap parts and ideas. The two show off the Apple I and Apple II computers at the club meetings, according to an article written by Wozniak. April 1, 1976: Jobs, Wozniak and Ron Wayne found Apple. Wayne, who worked with Jobs at Atari, gives up his 10 percent share of Apple less than two weeks later. April 16, 1977: Wozniak and Jobs introduce the Apple II, which becomes one of the first successful personal computers. May 1978: Jobs’ girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, gives birth to a girl, Lisa Brennan-Jobs. Chrisann raises Lisa mainly on her own. Jobs later reconciles with Lisa. Dec. 12, 1980: Apple goes public at $22 a share. Adjusted for splits since then, the initial public offering price is $2.75. Apple closed yesterday at $378.25. February 1982: Jobs, 26, is featured on the cover of Time under the headline, “Striking It Rich, America’s Risk Takers.” He appears on the magazine’s cover more than a half dozen times. January 1983: Apple releases the Lisa, the first commercially sold computer with a graphical user interface. The Lisa, with a price tag of $9,995, is a commercial failure. January 1984: Apple announces the new Macintosh computer with an ad that airs only once, during the Super Bowl. The ad shows a woman throw a hammer at a giant screen as a voice reads, “On January 24, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh and you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like ‘1984.’” The Mac, which sells for $2,500, becomes the first commercially successful personal computer to have a graphical user interface and mouse. September 1985: After being stripped of responsibilities amid a power struggle with Chief Executive Officer John Sculley and the board, Jobs resigns as chairman. He tells the board: “I’ve been thinking a lot and it’s time for me to get on with my life. It’s obvious that I’ve got to do something. I’m 30 years old,” according to Sculley’s book, “Odyssey: Pepsi to Apple.” Jobs soon starts NeXT Computer Inc., which builds high-powered educational computers.

Saab Says Companies ‘Showing Interest’ in Deal,['Ola Kinn' 'er'],2011-10-06 08:35:52,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/saab-says-several-companies-showing-interest-in-carmaker.html,"Saab Automobile said companies are “showing interest” in partnering with the Swedish carmaker as it works through a court-approved reorganization. “Several companies are showing interest in Saab right now,” spokesman Eric Geers said by telephone. “We of course have a binding agreement with Pangda and Youngman.” Saab expects Chinese authorities to make a ruling on the proposed partnerships with Pangda Automobile Trade Co. and Zhejiang Youngman on Oct. 14, Geers said.

BMW Struggles to Enlarge Mini Market as Coupe Vies for Worst Sales: Cars,['Chris Reiter'],2011-10-06 22:01:52,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/bmw-struggles-to-enlarge-mini-market-as-coupe-vies-for-worst-sales-cars.html,"Boris Knoblich is one of the reasons why Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) is struggling to create a bigger market for the Mini. The 37-year-old media consultant from Berlin doesn’t have the Munich-based manufacturer’s urban car brand on his shopping list, rejecting the new two-seater Mini coupe that his dealer offered as a replacement to his BMW 1-Series compact. “It’s a bit racy-looking compared with other Minis, but too small and not variable enough,” said Knoblich, who’s considering another 1-Series as well as an Audi A3 and Auris hybrid from Toyota Motor Corp. “I need a multifunctional car.” Mini, which was salvaged from the wreckage of the failed takeover of the U.K.’s Rover Group, is central to BMW’s strategy to meet tighter environmental standards and fend off Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi and Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz. The world’s biggest maker of luxury vehicles plans to tighten cooperation between Mini and the namesake brand by sharing front-wheel drive technology after the Mini hatchback is overhauled in 2014. The $22,000 coupe, which went on sale in Europe on Oct. 1 and will hit U.S. dealers later this fall, is the first of three new Mini variants that will go on sale by the end of next year, expanding the lineup to seven similarly sized vehicles. The new models, which all share the same basic underpinnings, will probably do little beyond keeping the brand’s sales from declining as the iconic Mini hatchback ages, analysts said. “Mini can’t do the volumes that they want with the body styles that they have,” said Rebecca Lindland , an analyst IHS Automotive in Norwalk, Connecticut. “They have to push the envelope up and down” with larger and smaller models. Worst Seller Growth in Mini’s deliveries will probably slow to 2.7 percent in 2012 and 1.6 percent in 2013 after jumping 23 percent this year on demand for the four-door Countryman crossover, according to IHS Automotive forecasts. The helmet-topped coupe will be joined by a roadster and the Paceman, a sportier crossover, by the end of 2012. The roadster and coupe are set to vie for the status as the brand’s worst seller, with coupe sales pegged at 6.2 percent of 2013 deliveries of 296,240 cars and the roadster at 5 percent, according to IHS. Audi targeted Mini with the A1 subcompact. Daimler is adding to that pressure as it rolls out five new Mercedes compact cars starting with the revamped B-Class this fall. The automaker’s Smart city car will expand beyond a two-seater from 2013, after confronting its own size limits. Mini isn’t concerned by the potential slow sales for the derivatives and plans further expansion to the lineup and markets, said Kay Segler, the brand’s chief. Ten Minis “I see great potential for Mini,” said Segler in an e- mail response to questions. “There’s no limit to our creativity. We can imagine additional models with typical Mini characteristics -- up to 10 models are conceivable.” Mini, based in Oxford, England, plans to enter India next year after expanding to Indonesia in 2011, he said. BMW is targeting record Mini sales this year, with deliveries set to rise at least 10 percent. The coupe, which competes with $19,545 Honda CR-Z, will be Mini’s first two-seater. The loss of the rear bench leads to a drop in weight of 60 kilograms (132 pounds), helping it accelerate to 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour in 9 seconds, one tenth of a second faster than the corresponding hatchback. The engines are shared with other Mini models. While it’s 2.9 centimeters (1.1 inches) shorter than the hatchback, the length and width are nearly identical, reflecting the size constraints faced by the brand’s models. High Margins “The coupe is quirky, but that’s what Mini is,” said Garel Rhys, president of the auto industry research center at the U.K.’s Cardiff University. “BMW is showing that they’re pretty clever and innovative with the derivatives.” The close association of the coupe with the brand’s other models should boost profit margins, especially considering its price is 1,650 euros, or 8.4 percent, more than the similarly equipped hatchback, said Jonathon Poskitt, an analyst at J.D. Power and Associates in Oxford, England. The coupe relies on “synergies” with other models and every variant has to “stand on its own,” Mini’s Segler said. The new two-seater will likely appeal to men under 35 looking for a conspicuous car, said Werner Entenmann, head of Autohaus Entenmann in Esslingen near Stuttgart. He celebrated the introduction of the model with a party for 800 guests, including a champagne reception and cocktails. ‘No Middle Ground’ “We expect it to be a niche, lifestyle-oriented car,” said Entenmann, who plans to reserve one or two places for the coupe in his Mini showroom, which can display up to eight vehicles. “It either fascinates or leaves people cold. There’s no middle ground.” The coupe is part of Mini’s development toward more independence, said the dealer, who sells Mini and BMW cars. He is hoping for a larger model from the brand. So is Knoblich. “Mini works as a city car,” said the 1-Series driver. “But I need something that’s a city car, can drive long distances and transport stuff and people. Mini doesn’t offer that right now.” To contact the reporter on this story: Chris Reiter in Berlin at  creiter2@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at  cthomas16@bloomberg.net",['Chris Reiter'],"BMW Struggles to Enlarge Mini Market as Coupe Vies for Worst Sales: Cars Boris Knoblich is one of the reasons why Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) is struggling to create a bigger market for the Mini.

While it’s 2.9 centimeters (1.1 inches) shorter than the hatchback, the length and width are nearly identical, reflecting the size constraints faced by the brand’s models. High Margins “The coupe is quirky, but that’s what Mini is,” said Garel Rhys, president of the auto industry research center at the U.K.’s Cardiff University. “BMW is showing that they’re pretty clever and innovative with the derivatives.” The close association of the coupe with the brand’s other models should boost profit margins, especially considering its price is 1,650 euros, or 8.4 percent, more than the similarly equipped hatchback, said Jonathon Poskitt, an analyst at J.D. Power and Associates in Oxford, England. The coupe relies on “synergies” with other models and every variant has to “stand on its own,” Mini’s Segler said. The new two-seater will likely appeal to men under 35 looking for a conspicuous car, said Werner Entenmann, head of Autohaus Entenmann in Esslingen near Stuttgart. He celebrated the introduction of the model with a party for 800 guests, including a champagne reception and cocktails. ‘No Middle Ground’ “We expect it to be a niche, lifestyle-oriented car,” said Entenmann, who plans to reserve one or two places for the coupe in his Mini showroom, which can display up to eight vehicles. “It either fascinates or leaves people cold. There’s no middle ground.” The coupe is part of Mini’s development toward more independence, said the dealer, who sells Mini and BMW cars. He is hoping for a larger model from the brand. So is Knoblich. “Mini works as a city car,” said the 1-Series driver. “But I need something that’s a city car, can drive long distances and transport stuff and people. Mini doesn’t offer that right now.” To contact the reporter on this story: Chris Reiter in Berlin at  creiter2@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at  cthomas16@bloomberg.net",5474,911,-1
Death of Jobs Leaves Hollywood Chiefs Without Trusted Silicon Valley Envoy,['Michael White' 'Ronald Grover' 'Andy Fixmer'],2011-10-07 06:30:58,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/steve-jobs-s-death-leaves-hollywood-without-trusted-silicon-valley-envoy.html,"Steve Jobs ’s death leaves Hollywood without the trusted technology envoy who helped push the film, TV and music industries into the digital age. In the 25 years after he bought George Lucas ’s digital animation business and renamed it Pixar, Jobs charmed, angered and cajoled Hollywood executives as he pursued his vision for digital entertainment. He clashed with former Walt Disney Co. (DIS) Chief Executive Officer Michael Eisner over their movie partnership, while befriending Eisner’s successor, Robert Iger. Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s co-founder relentlessly challenged the industry to change -- ushering in the age of digital animation with “Toy Story,” upending the record labels with the iPod and the iTunes store, and by negotiating to sell TV shows and films online. Disney’s ABC was the first to sign on. “Steve and I were talking for months about delivering TV shows on iTunes, which is when he shows me the video iPod, and I said, ‘We’re in!’” Iger said in e-mail. “Movies were next, a year later. It was about what we wanted to do and what we felt was right for our business.” With the 2006 sale of Pixar, Jobs became Burbank, California-based Disney’s biggest investor, with a stake worth $4.35 billion. Hollywood executives resisted putting shows online. Piracy had devastated the music industry and iTunes’ dominance of online music retailing gave Cupertino, California-based Apple unprecedented influence over the record labels. ‘Getting It’ Jobs was determined to get the studios on board, said Jim Gianopulos, co-chairman of News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox Filmed Entertainment. “He’d call up and say, ‘We’ve got to do this, this is the way to do it, and you guys aren’t getting it,’” Gianopulos said in an interview. “We would banter back and forth, but we always found ways to work together. To his great credit, he would see an aspect of the film side, the media side, that he hadn’t considered, and he would call back the next day and he would have figured out how to work that problem.” Today, iTunes is the top seller of online movies, with 66 percent of the market for electronic sales and Web video-on- demand, researcher IHS said in August. Its share of U.S. music retailing was 70 percent last year, according to NPD. “Steve understood that the only way to compete with piracy was to create a system that by its very nature is more convenient for consumers,” said Paul Vidich, a Warner Music Group Corp. (WMG) executive who negotiated the first record-label agreement with Apple. ‘Rocket Ship’ Diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer in 2003, Jobs died Oct. 5 at age 56. Gianopulos said his discussions with Jobs over film rights evolved into a personal friendship. “He would come into the meeting and say, ‘Hey, you want to see something cool?’ And he would reach into his jacket and pull out the first prototype of the iPhone,” Gianopulos said. “It was like someone had shown you the first rocket ship.” Disney, the pioneer in animation and theme parks, became a lab for Jobs. The studio served as distributor of Pixar movies starting in 1995. Later, after Jobs sold the animation studio to Disney for $8.06 billion in stock, the company became an Internet trailblazer as well -- becoming the first of its peers to offer films and TV shows on iTunes. Today former Pixar CEO Ed Catmull oversees all of Disney’s animation. John Lasseter, Pixar’s creative leader, holds a similar post at Disney with roles in films and theme parks. Clash With Eisner Relations with Disney almost foundered in 2003 in a dispute with Eisner over an extension of the Pixar deal, and on Jan. 30, 2004, Jobs announced Pixar was looking elsewhere. In nine years, the partnership had produced some of Disney’s top-grossing pictures, such as “Finding Nemo.” By that time, Eisner’s position at Disney was shaky. His pay and flagging stock angered institutional investors and Roy Disney, nephew of founder Walt and an influential shareholder. Iger was named to succeed Eisner in March 2005 and the first call was with Jobs. “He wished me well and hoped we could work together soon,” Iger said in a 2005 interview with Businessweek. In October, within two weeks of taking over, Iger agreed to sell episodes of TV shows from Disney’s ABC network on iTunes for $1.99 each. Three months later, he clinched the deal for Pixar. Pixar’s 12 movies have generated $5.73 billion in worldwide box office sales for Disney and theater operators, according to Box Office Mojo, a movie-tracking service. They’ve become theme- park attractions and a “Cars” land will open at Disney’s California Adventure next year. ‘Pretty Simple’ The entertainment industry is still grappling with how to prosper in the digital world Jobs helped create. In August, after a year-long experiment, Apple ended its 99-cent rentals of TV episodes from Fox and ABC. CBS Corp. (CBS) , owner of the most-watched U.S. TV network, and NBC didn’t participate because the price was too low. After first caving in to Jobs’s demands that all songs sell for 99 cents, the music industry last year won more control over pricing on iTunes, pushing through a 30-cent increase in the price of some tracks. Music executives credit Jobs with saving the industry from Internet piracy. “The guy had been doing serious thinking while we were all batting our heads against a wall,” Jimmy Iovine , chairman of Interscope-Geffen-A&M, said in a 2004 interview. “He was going to provide us with that great interface and we were going to give him unique content that you couldn’t get anywhere else.

Aluminum for delivery in three months increased as much as 3.4 percent to $2,244.75 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, the biggest intraday increase since Dec. 1. Alcoa Chief Executive Officer Klaus Kleinfeld said in July global aluminum demand will increase 12 percent in 2011 and double by the end of the decade as Asian countries build more office blocks and buy more aircraft, cars and trains. Alcoa said last month it’s spending $300 million to expand its Davenport, Iowa, rolled-products plant to meet rising demand from automakers. “They can talk about aerospace and automobiles all the time, that’s not going to be what really moves the needle,” Chuck Bradford, a metals analyst at Bradford Research Inc. in New York, said in an interview. “It’s the metal price.” Alcoa, which is based in New York, is scheduled to publish its third-quarter earnings after the close of trading on Oct. 11.

The factory in Resende, 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Rio, will be able to produce 200,000 cars and utility vehicles based on the company’s compact “V” platform, Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn said at an event in Rio today. It will employ 2,000 workers and open in 2014, according to Yokohama- based Nissan, which said it intended to build the plant in June. “Brazil has a level of motorization that is way below its potential,” Ghosn said today in an interview in Rio. The sales “trend over the long term, there’s no doubt in my mind, it’s going to be up. An average of 5 percent increase a year is totally reasonable for Brazil .” The country’s vehicle sales have risen at least 10 percent each of the past five years, and the market is now the world’s fifth-biggest by volume. The country raised taxes last month on certain vehicles with less than 65 percent of parts and materials made in the country, the Mercosur free-trade area or Mexico, to limit imports of low-cost vehicles. “Brazil is going to be Renault’s second-biggest market in the world by the end of this year,” Ghosn, chief executive of both Nissan and Renault SA (RNO) , said at a press conference in Brasilia on Oct. 1 after talks with President Dilma Rousseff.

Nissan’s market share in Brazil is 1.7 percent, more than double the level a year ago, and the company said it aims to raise it to at least 5 percent by 2016. “We are building this plant with a larger infrastructure than the 200,000 cars,” Ghosn said in an interview. “The 200,000 cars are only a first step into what should be a much bigger plant in the future.” Renault ranked fifth in Brazil vehicle sales in September and Nissan 10th, according to the National Vehicle Manufacturer’s Association in Sao Paulo.

"Connery to Craig, 007 Style Mirrored Times: Peter Rainer",['Peter Rainer'],2012-11-15 05:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/connery-to-craig-007-style-mirrored-times-peter-rainer.html,"The 007 movie franchise has turned 50 with the release of “ Skyfall ,” one of the best in the series. It’s already breaking box-office records overseas. The previous 22 Bond films have grossed around $5 billion, a sum that even Ernst Stavro Blofeld wouldn’t dismiss. Daniel Craig , in his third outing, is as craggy as ever but he’s also more three-dimensional, thanks to a Scottish-orphan backstory and a Freudian flourish involving Judi Dench’s matriarchal M. Sean Connery , for me and just about everybody else, remains the best of the babe-magnet Bonds. He had style to burn. The only time Craig dresses up is when he has to infiltrate bad-boy billionaire soirees. (There’s a lot of Bourne in this Bond). Connery liked to swank it up because his James had a snobby sense of entitlement and he knew how good he looked in a tux. Beginning in 1962 with “ Dr. No ” followed by “ From Russia With Love ,” “ Goldfinger ,” “ You Only Live Twice ” and “ Thunderball ” -- before he got a bit long in the tooth and loose in the flesh -- Connery had just the right curdling cruel mix of suavity and menace. Bond, he never let us forget, is licensed to kill. Brazenly Priapic Connery grew in stature as an actor outside of the series but he was never so brazenly priapic as he is in these films. Who else, grappling with crime-ring queen Pussy Galore in “Goldfinger” could deliver a line like “You’re a woman of many parts, Pussy” with a (sort of) straight face? Still, the series was never dependent on Connery for its success. After Connery and before Craig, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan all had a go at it. The formula, always loopier than the Ian Fleming novels, has continually adjusted to the zeitgeist. The early Cold War-era Connery films were top heavy with stateless master-race crazies seeking world domination. The “ Star Wars ” era resulted in the unfortunate “ Moonraker ,” with its zero-gravity laser battles barely mussing Moore’s cast- iron coif. Nothing mussed Moore really, which is why he was the most freeze-dried of the Bonds -- a debonair hologram. Even Brosnan, also afflicted with blow-dry suavity, had his ornery side. Moore only became fully human in “ The Spy Who Loved Me ,” when Jaws’s chompers were bearing down on the aghast Bond’s jugular. Enter Pulpathons In the eighties, with the advent of the violent Stallone- Schwarzenegger pulpathons, movies like “ For Your Eyes Only ” and “ License to Kill ,” the latter starring the moody, Hamlet- esque Dalton, emphasized ground-level crunch-and-thud theatrics. In “Skyfall,” Bond, who doesn’t seem to be especially computer literate, faces off against cyberwarriors. But throughout the series, no matter who his adversaries are -- blatant or shadowy, high-tech or lowdown -- Bond generally dispatches them the old-fashioned way: One on one. He’s battled baddies with cast-iron pecs and poison-tipped shoes (Robert Shaw and Lotte Lenya, respectively, in “From Russia With Love”). He’s fended off stainless steel incisors (Richard Kiel’s Jaws in “The Spy Who Loved Me” and “Moonraker”) and steel-rimmed bowler hats (Harold Sakata’s Oddjob in “Goldfinger”). Mads Mikkelsen in “ Casino Royale ” literally cried tears of blood. He’s tooled around in autogyros, space-station shuttles, Aston Martins, Lotuses, even invisible cars. The Bond series also has the distinction of being a pioneer in the dubious realm of product placement. Not for nothing was “ Die Another Day ” dubbed “Buy Another Day.” Throughout it all Bond remains the avatar of “For King and Country” sangfroid. He leapt to freedom in “The Spy Who Loved Me” in a Union Jack parachute. To kick off the London Olympics, Craig’s Bond escorted the Queen herself from Buckingham Palace.

It’s already breaking box-office records overseas. The previous 22 Bond films have grossed around $5 billion, a sum that even Ernst Stavro Blofeld wouldn’t dismiss. Daniel Craig , in his third outing, is as craggy as ever but he’s also more three-dimensional, thanks to a Scottish-orphan backstory and a Freudian flourish involving Judi Dench’s matriarchal M. Sean Connery , for me and just about everybody else, remains the best of the babe-magnet Bonds. He had style to burn. The only time Craig dresses up is when he has to infiltrate bad-boy billionaire soirees. (There’s a lot of Bourne in this Bond). Connery liked to swank it up because his James had a snobby sense of entitlement and he knew how good he looked in a tux. Beginning in 1962 with “ Dr. No ” followed by “ From Russia With Love ,” “ Goldfinger ,” “ You Only Live Twice ” and “ Thunderball ” -- before he got a bit long in the tooth and loose in the flesh -- Connery had just the right curdling cruel mix of suavity and menace. Bond, he never let us forget, is licensed to kill. Brazenly Priapic Connery grew in stature as an actor outside of the series but he was never so brazenly priapic as he is in these films. Who else, grappling with crime-ring queen Pussy Galore in “Goldfinger” could deliver a line like “You’re a woman of many parts, Pussy” with a (sort of) straight face? Still, the series was never dependent on Connery for its success. After Connery and before Craig, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan all had a go at it. The formula, always loopier than the Ian Fleming novels, has continually adjusted to the zeitgeist. The early Cold War-era Connery films were top heavy with stateless master-race crazies seeking world domination. The “ Star Wars ” era resulted in the unfortunate “ Moonraker ,” with its zero-gravity laser battles barely mussing Moore’s cast- iron coif. Nothing mussed Moore really, which is why he was the most freeze-dried of the Bonds -- a debonair hologram. Even Brosnan, also afflicted with blow-dry suavity, had his ornery side. Moore only became fully human in “ The Spy Who Loved Me ,” when Jaws’s chompers were bearing down on the aghast Bond’s jugular. Enter Pulpathons In the eighties, with the advent of the violent Stallone- Schwarzenegger pulpathons, movies like “ For Your Eyes Only ” and “ License to Kill ,” the latter starring the moody, Hamlet- esque Dalton, emphasized ground-level crunch-and-thud theatrics. In “Skyfall,” Bond, who doesn’t seem to be especially computer literate, faces off against cyberwarriors. But throughout the series, no matter who his adversaries are -- blatant or shadowy, high-tech or lowdown -- Bond generally dispatches them the old-fashioned way: One on one. He’s battled baddies with cast-iron pecs and poison-tipped shoes (Robert Shaw and Lotte Lenya, respectively, in “From Russia With Love”). He’s fended off stainless steel incisors (Richard Kiel’s Jaws in “The Spy Who Loved Me” and “Moonraker”) and steel-rimmed bowler hats (Harold Sakata’s Oddjob in “Goldfinger”). Mads Mikkelsen in “ Casino Royale ” literally cried tears of blood. He’s tooled around in autogyros, space-station shuttles, Aston Martins, Lotuses, even invisible cars. The Bond series also has the distinction of being a pioneer in the dubious realm of product placement. Not for nothing was “ Die Another Day ” dubbed “Buy Another Day.” Throughout it all Bond remains the avatar of “For King and Country” sangfroid. He leapt to freedom in “The Spy Who Loved Me” in a Union Jack parachute. To kick off the London Olympics, Craig’s Bond escorted the Queen herself from Buckingham Palace. It was a Rule Britannia joke the whole world was in on. The Bond franchise has more global reach than the old empire ever did.

Rolling Stones Start 50th Birthday Bash With New Songs,['Mark Beech'],2012-11-15 00:00:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/rolling-stones-start-50th-birthday-bash-with-new-songs.html,"The Rolling Stones’ new CD is aptly titled “Grrr!” That applies both to its content (only two unheard tracks in a $145 box) and the online prices of their sellout shows. Tickets are changing hands for $2,000. Mick Jagger is still repeatedly complaining of getting no satisfaction even after 50 years. That hasn’t stopped him spotting a golden opportunity to start up his money machine. The portentous “Doom and Gloom” and “One More Shot” are the first new songs in seven years, recorded in Paris. Both are quintessential Stones. Swaggering lyrics, solid riffs and beats go in a blender for yet another variant of the rock cocktail. The 89-track, 6-disc version of “Grrr!” also includes 12 early demos from the 1960s, though most people will be coming to this collection to catch up on why the Stones have endured. Even in its shorter three-CD, 50-track form, “Grrr!” is a chronologically sequenced hits set that’s more comprehensive than many predecessors such as “Rolled Gold” or “40 Licks.” While some songs are needlessly edited, the rabble-rousing numbers still jump out of the speakers: “Get Off of My Cloud,” “Honky Tonk Women,” “Brown Sugar.” It sounds best when they turn down the volume a notch and get a little folky or bluesy -- “Little Red Rooster,” “As Tears Go By” or “Wild Horses.” So far the tour to support the album consists of a handful of dates in London and Newark , New Jersey. While another concert has just been added for New York , “this may be the last time,” as the words of one song go. Pushing in the 70s Of the groups marking their half-century, the Beatles of course can’t reform, but Mick’s men, like the Beach Boys, are pushing into their 70s. The Stones can pretty much charge what they like -- and they do. Some VIP tickets had a face value of more than $1,000 even before touts got their hands on them. The most optimistic price on eBay, for seats right by the stage, is $15,000: It remains to be seen if anyone pays as much as this. I expect the audience will be made up of the long-term faithful, wealthy devotees and corporate-hospitality clients. If you can’t make it to the shows, it’s worth catching up with “Crossfire Hurricane,” premiered at the London Film Festival and showing on U.S. TV. Drawing on similar video material to Martin Scorsese ’s “Shine a Light” and Julien Temple’s “Stones at the Max,” this has Keith Richards trying to remember the deadly 1969 Altamont festival and Jagger recalling how the death of band founder Brian Jones still hurts. Stone Memories More memories are captured in “Charlie Is My Darling,” a grainy documentary of a 1965 weekend tour of Ireland, and the lavish photo book “Rolling Stones 50.” That follows a raft of bios offering contrasting views of Jagger -- tabloid-journalism style by Christopher Andersen and a sober account from Philip Norman. I’ve seen the Stones many times, so I look forward to reporting back on the first London show and determining whether they can still cut it. If you believe the reports, they still sound tight. Perhaps best to avert the eyes from Sir Mick’s leggings and “Keef’s” crazy hairdos. Sympathy for the Zimmer frame? We’ll see. The “Strolling Bones” bandwagon is still rolling, gathering no moss, just a lot of money. People will be in ecstasy with the final encores as Jumpin’ Jack Flash does it again.

He admitted to one count each of bankruptcy fraud, concealment of bankruptcy property and money laundering. On top of the bankruptcy charges, the former Major League Baseball player was convicted last year for trying to lease cars using phony business cards and credit information and is now serving three years in state prison. He was convicted in April of lewd conduct and assault and sentenced to 270 days in prison. Gretzky House In the bankruptcy matter, prosecutors said he defrauded his creditors, after he filed for bankruptcy, by stripping the mansion he had bought two years earlier from former National Hockey League player Wayne Gretzky of valuables including art, high-end stoves, sconces and plumbing fixtures. He also secretly sold his baseball memorabilia, prosecutors said. “Defendant broke the law because he wanted to line his own pockets and damage his creditors, and because he, as the celebrity Lenny Dykstra, thought he was untouchable and could get away with it,” prosecutors said in their filing. Dykstra filed his own sentencing papers under seal yesterday. U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson is scheduled to sentence him on Dec. 3.

Mexico’s Coppel Brothers Emerge With $16 Billion Fortune,['Alex Cuadros'],2012-11-15 14:31:20,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/mexico-s-coppel-brothers-emerge-with-16-billion-fortune.html,"In 1970, Enrique Coppel Tamayo introduced a credit card that allowed his working-class customers to buy clothing and furniture at a handful of retail stores he owned in Culiacan, Mexico. Four decades later, his five billionaire sons have leveraged that idea into a countrywide network of 1,000 emporiums, where low-income shoppers buy goods such as smartphones, washing machines and Lacoste perfumes on credit. They often opt to pay interest rates of as high as 60 percent -- more than 13 times the central bank’s benchmark -- to stretch their purchases over multiple installments. Closely held Coppel SA generates $4.6 billion in annual sales and has the widest profit margin of any major Latin American retailer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Through their holding company, Grupo Coppel, the brothers -- Agustin, Enrique, Ruben, Alberto and Jose Coppel Luken -- also have interests in a bank, a retirement-fund manager and real estate. Together, they control a combined fortune worth $15.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. None of them has ever appeared on an international wealth ranking. “They’re less visible than a comparable company on the exchange,” said Miguel Guzman, associate director for Latin American corporate debt for Fitch Ratings in Monterrey. “But they shouldn’t be underestimated. They’ve realized that the low- end market doesn’t mean that the people don’t want good service, good products and all of that.” Wanted Druglord With Mexico’s economy rebounding from the 2009 recession, and unemployment declining, the country’s consumers have more cash to spend on household goods. Coppel’s department stores across the country give the poorer among them the chance to buy a sofa-bed or an iPhone in small payments over six to 18 months. The Coppel empire has expanded despite the surge in violence in their native state of Sinaloa, home to the cartel of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, Mexico’s most-wanted druglord. In a Nov. 13 telephone interview, Agustin Coppel, the 51- year-old current chairman and chief executive, said he disagrees with Bloomberg’s calculation of his family’s net worth. He declined to elaborate, and turned down additional interview requests. Coppel’s founder, Enrique Coppel Tamayo, passed his shares to his five sons years before his death in 2007, said Alberto Martinez, a company spokesman, by phone on Nov. 12. As of 1999, Agustin had 17 percent of the company, Enrique held 25 percent, Ruben had 20 percent and Alberto Coppel owned 19 percent, according to a convertible bond prospectus published at the time. Jose’s 19 percent stake is accounted for by holdings in his wife’s name and an anonymous fund in the prospectus. The family declined to comment on whether the stakes have changed since then. Grupo Elektra The company’s retail operation generated 60.8 billion Mexican pesos ($4.6 billion) in sales, 11.9 billion pesos in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and 8.3 billion pesos in profit in the 12 months ending Sept. 30, with net debt of 11.4 billion pesos, according to annualized results from financial statements published on the Mexican stock exchange’s website. Coppel’s 20 percent Ebitda margin and 14 percent profit margin are the biggest of any Latin American retailer with a market value of at least $1 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Its closest competitor is Grupo Elektra SAB, controlled by fellow-Mexican Ricardo Salinas , who holds 83rd place on Bloomberg’s index with a fortune of $10.7 billion. Agustin, the youngest Coppel brother, is worth $2.7 billion, while Enrique, the oldest, is worth $4 billion. Jose and Alberto both have a fortune of $3 billion, while Ruben’s is $3.2 billion. The retailer had the equivalent of $2 billion in outstanding loans to customers at the end of the third quarter. Customers were late on 26 percent of that amount, according to the company. Family Bank Coppel’s retail operation is valued at $14.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, when comparing its results to the average enterprise value-to-Ebitda and price-to- earnings multiples of five Latin American peers: Mexico’s Elektra and El Puerto de Liverpool SAB, Colombia ’s Almacenes Exito SA (EXITO) , Chile ’s SACI Falabella (FALAB) and Brazil ’s Lojas Americanas SA. (LAME4) Enterprise value is defined by the Bloomberg ranking as market capitalization plus total debt minus cash. BanCoppel SA, the family’s bank, generated a profit of 350 million pesos in the 12 months ending Sept. 30, with stockholder equity of 2.3 billion pesos. It’s valued at $390 million when comparing the results to the average price-to-earnings and price-to-book multiples of five peers: Mexico’s Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB and Compartamos SAB, Bancolombia SA (CIB) , Scotiabank Peru SA and Chile’s Banco de Credito & Inversiones. Five Brothers The family’s retirement-fund unit, Afore Coppel SA, managed at least 60 billion pesos as of September and charged an annual fee of 1.59 percent, according to data from the Mexican retirement-fund agency, known as Consar. The resulting annual revenue of 955 million pesos was compared to the average price- to-earnings multiple of Chile’s AFP Provida SA and AFP Habitat SA (HABITAT) and Colombia’s AFP Proteccion SA, giving it a value of $370 million. In 2011, Coppel stores paid 1.4 billion pesos in rent for the properties owned by the brothers’ Sakly SA. The company is valued at $450 million when comparing its revenue to the average enterprise value-to-Ebitda multiple of two peers: Mexico’s Inmuebles Carso SAB and Brazil’s Cyrela Commercial Properties SA. The family reinvested all of the retailer’s profits from 2002 through 2008, according to a statement with Mexico’s exchange. Based on reported dividends since then, after subtracting reinvestments in their bank and accounting for market performance, the brothers probably control a combined investment portfolio of more than $275 million. Polish Immigrants In a telephone interview Nov. 12, investor relations director Edith Pena confirmed Grupo Coppel is controlled by the Coppel brothers. That holding company owns 87 percent of the retail business, after accounting for the outstanding bonds that will be converted into shares, and at least 99 percent of the family’s three other units. The retailer’s 2010 report also said the brothers are its main shareholders. The family’s philanthropy is private, said Gisela Casarin, a company spokeswoman. In February 2009, Yolanda Luken de Coppel, the patriarch’s widow, attended the inauguration of the Enrique Coppel Tamayo track at the Culiacan Equestrian Club, according to the local Noroeste newspaper. The following month, the paper reported that the Coppels had funded the construction of three churches in Sinaloa state. Brazil, Argentina The Coppel empire traces back to the 1930s, when Enrique Coppel Tamayo, a descendant of Polish immigrants, started a gift shop in the coastal Mexican town of Mazatlan with a 5,000-peso loan from his mother. In 1941, he moved his business to nearby Culiacan, capital of Sinaloa. He traveled to Dallas to buy goods, branching out into foodstuffs, bicycles, furniture and electronics. Early on, he started extending credit to his customers, who were often poor. That model sustains the company today. In 1970, he created the Coppel card for purchases at his stores. In the 1980s, with a dozen stores built around Culiacan, he passed the reins to his oldest son, Enrique Coppel Luken, who expanded to cities across Mexico while also broadening their product offering. By 1990, his son had grown the company to 30 stores; by 2001, the family had 143, according to a 2003 doctoral thesis on the company presented at Mexico City’s Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana. 60 Percent The patriarch died in 2007. The next year, Agustin took the helm of the retailer so that Enrique could focus on the retailer’s international expansion and their recently acquired financial interests. Since then, Coppel has opened eight stores in Brazil and another eight in Argentina. Earlier this month, they opened their 1,000th Mexican store in Teotihuacan. Much of the family is still based in Culiacan, where the company is headquartered. When contacted by Bloomberg News by phone on Nov. 14, a worker at a Coppel store in Atizapan de Zaragoza, near Mexico City, said that the company card allows a customer to purchase an electric oven or furniture in biweekly payments over 12 months at a 33 percent annual interest rate, or over 18 months at a 60 percent rate. “Change has been a constant at Coppel,” Enrique Coppel Luken once said, according to the doctoral thesis. “But also the constant effort to really put into practice -- on the sales floor, in our contact with the customer -- everything we see that will help us attend to the customer better.” To contact the reporter on this story: Alex Cuadros in Sao Paulo at  acuadros@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew G.

The family reinvested all of the retailer’s profits from 2002 through 2008, according to a statement with Mexico’s exchange. Based on reported dividends since then, after subtracting reinvestments in their bank and accounting for market performance, the brothers probably control a combined investment portfolio of more than $275 million. Polish Immigrants In a telephone interview Nov. 12, investor relations director Edith Pena confirmed Grupo Coppel is controlled by the Coppel brothers. That holding company owns 87 percent of the retail business, after accounting for the outstanding bonds that will be converted into shares, and at least 99 percent of the family’s three other units. The retailer’s 2010 report also said the brothers are its main shareholders. The family’s philanthropy is private, said Gisela Casarin, a company spokeswoman. In February 2009, Yolanda Luken de Coppel, the patriarch’s widow, attended the inauguration of the Enrique Coppel Tamayo track at the Culiacan Equestrian Club, according to the local Noroeste newspaper. The following month, the paper reported that the Coppels had funded the construction of three churches in Sinaloa state. Brazil, Argentina The Coppel empire traces back to the 1930s, when Enrique Coppel Tamayo, a descendant of Polish immigrants, started a gift shop in the coastal Mexican town of Mazatlan with a 5,000-peso loan from his mother. In 1941, he moved his business to nearby Culiacan, capital of Sinaloa. He traveled to Dallas to buy goods, branching out into foodstuffs, bicycles, furniture and electronics. Early on, he started extending credit to his customers, who were often poor. That model sustains the company today. In 1970, he created the Coppel card for purchases at his stores. In the 1980s, with a dozen stores built around Culiacan, he passed the reins to his oldest son, Enrique Coppel Luken, who expanded to cities across Mexico while also broadening their product offering. By 1990, his son had grown the company to 30 stores; by 2001, the family had 143, according to a 2003 doctoral thesis on the company presented at Mexico City’s Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana. 60 Percent The patriarch died in 2007. The next year, Agustin took the helm of the retailer so that Enrique could focus on the retailer’s international expansion and their recently acquired financial interests. Since then, Coppel has opened eight stores in Brazil and another eight in Argentina. Earlier this month, they opened their 1,000th Mexican store in Teotihuacan. Much of the family is still based in Culiacan, where the company is headquartered. When contacted by Bloomberg News by phone on Nov. 14, a worker at a Coppel store in Atizapan de Zaragoza, near Mexico City, said that the company card allows a customer to purchase an electric oven or furniture in biweekly payments over 12 months at a 33 percent annual interest rate, or over 18 months at a 60 percent rate. “Change has been a constant at Coppel,” Enrique Coppel Luken once said, according to the doctoral thesis. “But also the constant effort to really put into practice -- on the sales floor, in our contact with the customer -- everything we see that will help us attend to the customer better.” To contact the reporter on this story: Alex Cuadros in Sao Paulo at  acuadros@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew G.

"Butts, Rubber Ducky, Lime M&M Make You Sad; Tough Boxers",['Lance Esplund'],2012-11-15 05:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/butts-rubber-ducky-lime-m-m-make-you-sad-tough-boxers.html,"Gabriel Orozco, born in Mexico in 1962, is a treasure hunter who turns the tradition of the readymade nearly on its head. The Guggenheim Museum’s sculptural and photographic installation “Gabriel Orozco: Asterisms” comprises more than 2,000 items of detritus the artist scavenged from two sites. Here the found object is closer to the visual poetry of Joseph Cornell than the predictable gamesmanship of Duchamp. This hasn’t usually been the case. In his recent, smug midcareer retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art , Orozco displayed an empty shoebox and hung four plastic yogurt lids, one per gallery wall. At the Guggenheim, tiny objects Orozco found on an AstroTurf playing field near his home in New York City are exhibited in a tabletop vitrine, as if in a jeweler’s case. Cigarette butts, chewing gum, wadded foil wrappers, twisted hairpins, zippers, matchsticks, tangled bits of thread and a single lime-green M&M all take on magical weight and promise. Arranged on the floor, also in a rectangular grid, are hundreds of larger bits of worn and weathered debris recovered from a coastal wildlife reserve in Baja California , Mexico. Rubber Ducky Orozco has collected oars, buoys, bottles, light bulbs, hardhats, a rubber ducky, a scuba flipper and dozens of waterlogged rolls of toilet paper that resemble conch shells and driftwood. Some of the bottles contain rolled-up messages. Everything on view is grouped systematically by shape, color, material and texture, to suggest progression, migration, kinship and evolution. This is further enhanced in Orozco’s large photographic grids, in which each object, documented on a white ground, has been scaled up or down to postcard size. Orozco’s installation is understated and coldly scientific. Yet he has lovingly attended to his trove. The overall effect of its archaeological homogenization is melancholic -- akin to putting the ruins of our own civilization under the microscope. “Gabriel Orozco: Asterisms” runs through Jan. 13 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Ave. Information: +1-212-423- 3500; http://www.guggenheim.org. George Bellows The most famous paintings by the American artist George Bellows (1882-1925), such as the ringside boxing scenes “Stag at Sharkey’s” (1909) and “Dempsey and Firpo” (1924), may be among the least compelling works in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s enlightening Bellows retrospective. They’re both good paintings. But we’ve seen these iconic pictures so often in reproduction that their sinewy, muscled athleticism and their expressive, cigar-chewing cronies suggest illustrative period caricature more than dynamic realism. These two paintings bookend -- and strong-arm -- the Met’s show of some 120 pictures, in which we get the full range of Bellows’s oeuvre, from satirical to tender. Here are portraits, seascapes, landscapes, city scenes, views of Coney Island and politically charged images of New York City slums, election scenes and racially motivated killings. Dark Urgency Bellows had many influences. He quotes Velazquez, Manet, Courbet and Titian. In the portraits of friends and family, his dark urgency, nearer to that of Blake and Goya than John Singer Sargent, probes deeper than Sargent’s florid fascination with Edwardian surfaces. Bellows’s drawings and prints are forceful, at times so thick with people and activity that they take on Dickensian magnitude. But sometimes, as in his densely packed urban series “Cliff Dwellers” (1913), Bellows seems to have lost steam. The works on paper are exciting, but the canvas is lackluster. The show could have been better edited. Its mediocre pictures, weakened by flaccid drawing and strident or muddy color, distract from the strongest works, such as his late landscapes and nudes. Still, this exhibit proves that Bellows was a more complicated and greater artist than I imagined. He is grittier, rougher around the edges, more vulgar than many of his fellow countrymen. Whether he is considered a major modern illustrator or a minor modern painter, Bellows is an American original. “George Bellows” runs through Feb. 18 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , 1000 Fifth Ave. Information: +1-212-535-7710; http://www.metmuseum.org.

Munich’s Biggest Power Outage in Two Decades Brings City to Halt,['Stefan Nicola'],2012-11-15 16:42:27,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/munich-s-biggest-power-outage-in-two-decades-brings-city-to-halt.html,"Munich is recovering from its biggest power failure in two decades, a blackout that affected at least 450,000 customers in Germany ’s third-biggest city, halting underground trains and trapping people in elevators. Stadtwerke Muenchen GmbH is investigating the cause of the outage that spread across Munich’s southwest, starting at 7 a.m., the utility said today in an e-mailed statement. The outage lasted from 10 minutes in some parts to more than three hours in the Aubing district, disrupting commutes in the city that is home to Siemens AG (SIE) and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , and causing an explosion at a transformer station in the Bogenhausen district. “The last time Munich saw such a wide-spread power failure was 20 years ago,” said Stephan Schwarz, the managing director of supply and technology at the utility. Bernadette Mohme, 31, opted to take the car instead of the subway when she discovered the failure. It took her almost an hour to drive about 5 kilometers from her home near the Olympic stadium to the state parliament at the center, where she works for the Free Democratic Party. “Traffic lights were out, so police directed traffic, and streetcars were stopped in the middle of the street,” Mohme said by phone. “It was absolute chaos.” Power supply has moved to the center of the political agenda in Germany ever since Chancellor Angela Merkel decided in March 2011 to replace nuclear reactors with clean fossil-fired plants and a growing share of renewable-energy sources. Her government has backed plans to prevent utilities including EON SE and RWE AG (RWE) from closing unprofitable power plants as the nation seeks to safeguard supply. Abrupt Change The abrupt policy change risks creating shortages in Germany’s industrial south, which has lost about 5 gigawatts of reactor capacity, because of a lack of cross-country power lines, according to state-owned researcher Dena Energy Agency. Statdwerke Muenchen said the failure originated at the intersection of a power line owned by the utility and a switch point of the EON grid. EON rejected the blame, saying in an e- mailed statement that its network didn’t experience any interruptions until about an hour after the failure began.

"Amtrak Back to Full Service for Thanksgiving, CEO Says",['Alan Levin'],2012-11-15 21:57:29,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/amtrak-back-to-full-service-for-thanksgiving-ceo-says.html,"Amtrak will be ready to handle the surge of passengers expected during the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday after completing repairs on equipment damaged by last month’s superstorm, the passenger rail system’s chief said. A New Jersey power substation damaged by Hurricane Sandy , which struck the east coast on Oct. 29, will be fully functional tomorrow, and the railroad is borrowing equipment from Canada so it will have enough cars for holiday travelers, Joseph Boardman, Amtrak’s chief executive officer, said today in an interview. “We expect to be able to cover our full service load for Thanksgiving,” Boardman said of the holiday that falls on Nov. 22 this year. “There are a lot of people that want to move.” The Washington-based railroad had been limited to about 24 trains a day through its two tunnels under the Hudson River because a power station was damaged by the storm, Boardman said. The full complement of 38 trains should be running tomorrow, he said. Those tunnels connect New York’s Pennsylvania Station to locations to the south and west. Without Substation 41, as it is known, in Kearny, New Jersey, there wasn’t enough electricity to power Amtrak ’s regular schedule. The railroad also is obtaining extra equipment from Via Rail Canada Inc., which will be used on the line from Albany , New York, to Montreal , he said. Amtrak will then be able to redeploy its own equipment to New Jersey to supplement that state’s rail system, which was damaged in the storm, he said. Busy Holiday The railroad’s busiest period each year is during Thanksgiving. Last year, a record 724,000 people traveled on the rail system during the eight days surrounding the holiday, according to a release. Boardman spoke after delivering a speech in Washington at a U.S. National Mediation Board conference. The railroad chief also said he’s looking forward to working with the presumptive new chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster. “I think that Bill Shuster wants to get some things done,” Boardman said. “We’re happy about that. We want him to get things done.” Shuster is a regular user of Amtrak, Boardman said. “We know he knows us.” Shuster announced his candidacy for the chairmanship to other lawmakers on Nov. 7, according to a release from his office. The current transportation chairman, Representative John Mica, a Florida Republican, can’t return to the post because of party term limits unless Republican leadership grants him an exemption. Mica has held several hearings in recent months critical of Amtrak, which he calls a “Soviet-style” operation. At a hearing on Aug. 2, Mica said Amtrak had lost $833.8 million in food and beverage service over 10 years.

The current transportation chairman, Representative John Mica, a Florida Republican, can’t return to the post because of party term limits unless Republican leadership grants him an exemption. Mica has held several hearings in recent months critical of Amtrak, which he calls a “Soviet-style” operation. At a hearing on Aug. 2, Mica said Amtrak had lost $833.8 million in food and beverage service over 10 years.

Nissan Weighs Mexico for Next North America Plant,['Brendan Case' 'Jose Enrique Arrioja'],2012-11-15 03:08:36,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/nissan-weighs-mexico-for-next-north-america-plant.html,"Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Mexico’s largest automaker, will consider the country along with the U.S. for a new North American factory to meet demand in both nations, Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn said. “We will need capacity in North America and yes, there is a high probability that in the future we will be announcing a new plant in Mexico or in the U.S.,” Ghosn told reporters in Mexico City yesterday, without providing a timetable for the decision. Nissan is already building its third plant in Mexico, breaking ground in July on the $2 billion factory in the central state of Aguascalientes. The Yokohama, Japan-based automaker boosted production in Mexico by 16 percent to more than 583,000 vehicles in the first 10 months of this year, according to the Mexican Automobile Industry Association. That makes Nissan part of an assembly-line surge pushing Mexican auto output and exports toward a record in 2012. Foreign automakers have announced $7.8 billion in investments in the country in the past 24 months, according to Sean McAlinden , a labor economist with the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor , Michigan. The new North America plant would probably be needed based on sales forecasts for the next three years, Ghosn said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Taking Stock” with Pimm Fox. Ghosn said no decision has been made yet on the location or timing of the plant. Sentra, Versa Models Nissan makes such models as the Sentra and Versa in Mexico. It is also investing 2.6 billion reais ($1.3 billion) to build a plant near Rio de Janeiro with a production capacity of 200,000 units that’s scheduled to open in 2014. Demand in the U.S. “is recovering but not yet to the level before the 2008 financial crisis,” said Takeshi Miyao, an analyst at research firm Carnorama Japan in Tokyo. “Considering the U.S. demography and economy, the demand may keep recovering, so Nissan’s capacity in North America will not be enough and it’s necessary to have another plant.” Ghosn has said he wants Nissan to win 10 percent of auto sales in the U.S., where it currently holds a 7.9 percent market share, down from 8.1 percent a year ago. The company has a 25 percent share in Mexico, making it the nation’s top auto seller, according to the Mexican Automobile Industry Association. Ghosn said he was in Mexico to meet with President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto and to inaugurate a charging station for electric cars today. Leaf Sales Decline Nissan isn’t on pace to meet its sales target for battery- powered Leaf hatchbacks in the U.S., Ghosn said in the Bloomberg Television interview. “The forecast we have given ourselves for the year will not be reached,” he said. In January, he set a target of selling 20,000 Leafs in the U.S. this year. Sales through October totaled 6,791, down 16 percent from a year earlier. Limited charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in the U.S. has tempered demand, Ghosn said. “We’re trying to convince more cities and states to invest in this infrastructure,” he said. “We recognize the fact that the increase of sales is taking more time than we thought at the beginning.” To contact the reporters on this story: Brendan Case in Mexico City at  bcase4@bloomberg.net ; Jose Enrique Arrioja in Mexico City at  jarrioja@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Ed Dufner at  edufner@bloomberg.net",['Brendan CaseJose Enrique Arrioja'],"Nissan Weighs Mexico for Next North America Plant Nissan Motor Co.

"Chrysler to Add 1,250 Jobs to Boost Pickup, Engine Output",['Craig Trudell'],2012-11-15 23:01:15,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/chrysler-to-add-1-250-jobs-to-boost-pickup-engine-output.html,"Chrysler Group LLC, the automaker planning to merge with Fiat SpA (F) , will add 1,250 workers at three U.S. plants to boost output of pickups and engines. Chrysler plans to invest $238 million in the factories, including the Ram 1500 assembly plant in Warren, Michigan, according to a statement. The Warren factory will add a third crew of workers and 1,000 new jobs, the company said yesterday. “All of these investments are the direct result of a lot of people who have battled courageously to bring Chrysler back to a state of growth,” Sergio Marchionne, chief executive officer of Chrysler and Fiat, said in the statement. Chrysler introduced a redesigned Ram 1500 pickup in September to help maintain U.S. sales growth that has outpaced larger U.S. competitors General Motors Co. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. (F) The Auburn Hills, Michigan-based automaker delivered almost 1.38 million cars and light trucks this year through October, a 23 percent increase. Gains of 3.6 percent by GM and 4.9 percent by Ford trailed the industry’s 14 percent increase. Marchionne, 60, plans to merge Chrysler with Turin, Italy- based Fiat by 2015. The ability for Fiat, which owns 58.5 percent of Chrysler, to buy the rest is limited by a turnaround plan that Italy ’s largest manufacturer announced last month, Marchionne said at the time. Engine Plants Chrysler will invest $198 million in its Mack I Engine plant in Detroit to add production of six-cylinder engines and as many as 250 jobs. Another $40 million will be invested in the Trenton North engine factory in Trenton, Michigan. “Our biggest headache this year has been the shortage of 3.6-liter engines,” Marchionne told reporters in Detroit yesterday, referring to the six-cylinder Pentastar. “We just can’t make enough. I’m not sure that this expansion by itself is going to take us where we need to be.” The Mack I plant currently builds larger eight-cylinder engines for the Ram 1500. That engine will be phased out in 2013’s first quarter, and Chrysler will begin producing the Pentastar six-cylinder there in early 2014. The Trenton plant’s flexible line will give Chrysler the ability to adjust for building either the Pentastar V-6 or its four-cylinder Tigershark engine. Chrysler’s factory in Dundee, Michigan, is currently its only U.S. plant building four- cylinder engines.

Hertz Dollar Thrifty Purchase Cleared by U.S. Regulator,['Mark Clothier' 'Sara Forden'],2012-11-16 14:45:19,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/hertz-dollar-thrifty-purchase-cleared-by-u-s-regulator.html,"Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) ’s $2.6 billion purchase of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. was cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators yesterday after almost a half-decade of trying and some late-hour concessions for regulators concerned the deal would limit competition. Hertz agreed to sell 62 Advantage brand outlets along with the rights to operate 29 Dollar Thrifty on-airport locations, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said in a statement. Sixteen of the airport outlets were part of the original deal between the companies, and the FTC demanded that 13 more be sold after the deal closes to maintain competition in those markets. The acquisition solidifies Hertz’s place as the second- biggest in the U.S. rental-car market, ahead of Avis Budget Group Inc. (CAR) Enterprise Holdings Inc., which operates the Enterprise, Alamo and National brands, is the biggest. Giving Hertz two lower-priced leisure brands to balance its premium namesake brand is a positive for the industry, said Chris Agnew, a Stamford , Connecticut-based analyst at MKM Partners LLC. “It’s good for balanced, rational competition for the main companies to have dual-brand strategies,” Agnew said yesterday in a telephone interview. “Hertz with only one main brand had created an imbalance.” The FTC voted 4-1 in favor of approval after concessions by Hertz, made in talks over the past two weeks, to shed the additional locations to ease antitrust concerns as the market shrunk from four major companies to three, people familiar with the process said. Hertz may be able to keep Dollar and Thrifty counters at some of those airports, Hertz said in its statement. Market Share Together, Hertz, Enterprise and Avis control about 75 percent of the market, with Dollar Thrifty holding 5 percent, according to a February report from IBISWorld, the Santa Monica , California-based industry researcher. No other competitor has more than 1 percent of this year’s $30.5 billion market in the U.S., according to IBISWorld. Earlier in its negotiations with the agency, Hertz pledged to sell its 62 Advantage-brand outlets in the U.S. Franchise Services of North America Inc. and Macquarie Group Ltd.’s Macquarie Capital. The purchase price was $16 million, one person with knowledge of the situation has said. The sale is dependent upon Hertz completing the acquisition of Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Dollar Thrifty. When Hertz announced the acquisition in late August, it said it expected at least $160 million in annual cost-savings and sales-growth potential. The moves to address the FTC’s concerns shouldn’t change the benefit of the deal for Hertz, Fred Lowrance, a Nashville, Tennessee-based analyst at Avondale Partners LLC, said in an interview. Benefits Maintained “These concessions are not a needle-mover, for Hertz at least,” Lowrance said. “Maybe it was for the FTC and their view of what competition was like in the rental-car industry, but this doesn’t change the economics of the deal.” The FTC alleged that the acquisition as originally proposed would have led to “substantially more concentration in 72 airport rental-car markets” and by eliminating head-to-head competition between Hertz and Dollar Thrifty. “American consumers rent more than 50 million vehicles at airports nationwide each year, spending $11 billion, so this is a real pocketbook issue for everyday people,” FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said in the statement. “Today’s bipartisan action by the FTC will ensure that consumers are not forced to pay higher prices for rental cars when they travel.” One Dissenter Commissioner Tom Rosch dissented, saying he found the divestitures “inadequate to resolve the competitive concerns at several dozen other airports,” according to the statement. Rosch said he would have challenged the transaction because of the “significant risk” it could lead to higher prices and disadvantage consumers in other ways through coordinated actions by the remaining industry players. The four largest companies -- Enterprise, Hertz, Avis Budget Group Inc. and Dollar Thrifty -- have controlled 80 percent of the U.S. market, according to IBISWorld. Enterprise will command 38 percent of the $30.5 billion market in the U.S. this year, Hertz will have 18.9 percent, followed by Avis with 18.5 percent and Dollar Thrifty with about 5 percent. The $87.50-a-share offer represents an 8 percent premium to Dollar Thrifty’s closing price of $81 (DTG) on Aug. 24. The price is more than twice the $41-a-share Hertz offered in April 2010. Franchise Services, which operates the U-Save brand, is run by Co-Chief Executive Officer Sanford Miller, the CEO of Budget Group Inc. from 1997 to 2004. While the FTC staff raised concerns about the strength of the buyer and its ability to become a viable competitor, those questions weren’t deal- breakers with regulators, the people said. April 2007 Hertz began its pursuit of Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Dollar Thrifty in April 2007 and made a formal bid of about $1.2 billion in 2010 that Dollar Thrifty shareholders rejected. Park Ridge , New Jersey-based Hertz made another offer last year that it later withdrew, citing market conditions. Hertz, with 8,750 outlets worldwide, has more than 3,900 U.S. locations, while Dollar Thrifty has about 280 corporate- owned outlets in the U.S. and Canada. Last month, Hertz extended the FTC’s legal deadline for ruling on the deal to Nov. 16 from Oct. 31 because the agency hadn’t finished its review of information provided by the companies, Hertz said in a statement. When Hertz announced the proposed acquisition on Aug. 26, it said FTC approval was expected by mid-October. People familiar with the deal said it ran into resistance from some of the agency’s staff and commissioners. All Concerns “The FTC requirement to add assets to the divestiture package demonstrates the importance of ensuring that all competition law concerns are resolved to obtain commission approval,” said William Vigdor, an antitrust lawyer with Vinson & Elkins LLP in Washington , who served at the FTC for six years. Hertz and Dollar Thrifty said the transaction is a two-step process starting with a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of Dollar Thrifty followed by a cash merger to acquire any remaining shares of common stock. The tender offer closes at 5 p.m. New York time. Dollar Thrifty rose 0.6 percent to $87.48 at 9:40 a.m. in New York, and Hertz jumped 3.1 percent to $14.69.

Consumer Prices in U.S. Rose at a Slower Pace in October,['Shobhana Ch' 'ra'],2012-11-15 13:45:17,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/consumer-prices-in-u-s-increased-at-a-slower-pace-in-october.html,"The cost of living rose in October at the slowest pace in three months, a sign U.S. inflation is in check. The 0.1 percent increase in the consumer-price index followed a 0.6 percent gain the prior month, the Labor Department reported today in Washington. The median estimate of 83 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.1 percent rise. The so-called core measure, which excludes more volatile food and energy costs, climbed 0.2 percent, more than projected, reflected rising rents and clothing costs. Macy’s Inc. (M) is among retailers planning holiday discounts, while Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) are battling to offer the best online prices on toys, indicating companies have little leeway to charge more. The inflation outlook is in sync with the Federal Reserve ’s view and gives policy makers room to concentrate on boosting growth. “Inflation in the U.S. is very subdued,” said Sal Guatieri , a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, who correctly forecast the gain in prices. “This is allowing the Fed to strive toward supporting job growth and reducing unemployment.” Bloomberg survey estimates for the consumer-price index ranged from a drop of 0.1 percent to an increase of 0.3 percent. In the 12 months ended in October, consumer prices rose 2.2 percent, the report showed. Core Prices The core CPI reading showed the biggest increase since June and compared with a 0.1 percent median forecast of economists surveyed. Core prices were up 2 percent for the year through October, the same as in the 12 months through September. A separate report from the Labor department showed more Americans than forecast submitted claims for unemployment insurance last week as superstorm Sandy wreaked havoc on the job market. Applications for jobless benefits surged by 78,000 to 439,000 in the week ended Nov. 10, the most since April 2011. Several states said the increase was due to the storm that hit the Northeastern part of the country in late October, a Labor Department spokesman said as the data were released to the press. Also today, manufacturing in the New York region contracted for a fourth straight month in November as Sandy knocked out electrical power and limited activity, figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shoed. Its general economic index was minus 5.2 this month compared with minus 6.2 in October. Readings of less than zero signal contraction in New York, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut. Shares Fall Stock-index futures dropped after the reports, erasing earlier gains, on the larger-than-expected increase in jobless claims. The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index maturing in December declined 0.2 percent to 1,350.7 at 8:44 a.m. in New York. The CPI report showed energy costs fell 0.2 percent in October from a month earlier. A gallon of regular fuel at the pump has averaged $3.46 so far in November, down 41 cents from a recent high of $3.87 on Sept. 13, according to AAA, the biggest U.S. auto group. Restrained fuel costs may help Americans’ recover some of the buying power they’ve lost this year as salaries stagnated. Hourly wages adjusted for inflation decreased 0.2 percent on average in October after a 0.3 percent drop the prior month, a separate Labor Department report today showed. Over the past 12 months, real hourly pay was down 0.7 percent. Food Costs The consumer-price report showed food costs advanced 0.2 percent. The core measure was propelled by a 0.4 percent increase in the index for rents, the biggest gain since June 2008. A measure designed to track the rental value of owner-occupied houses rose 0.2 percent. Clothing costs increased 0.7 percent, hotel fares climbed 0.5 percent, and airline fares climbed 2.4 percent. In contrast, medical care expenses were little changed, the first time since July 2010 they didn’t increase. The index for used cars and trucks dropped 0.9 percent, the fourth consecutive decrease. Macy’s, the second-largest U.S. department-store chain, posted third-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates while its forecast for the end of the year signaled it may use heavy discounts to draw holiday shoppers. Discounting Toys Amazon.com has cheaper online prices for toys than Wal- Mart, Target Corp. and other major chains as parents begin shopping for the holidays, according to a Bloomberg Industries analysis. In a comparison of 125 randomly selected toys conducted Nov. 8, Amazon had lower prices than Wal-Mart on 44 percent of the items, while Wal-Mart had the advantage on 13 percent. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, today forecast profit this year that trailed some analysts’ estimates after difficult economic conditions slowed sales gains at established U.S. stores in the third quarter. “Current macroeconomic conditions continue to pressure our customers,” Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said in a statement. “The holiday season is predicted to be very competitive.” Limited price pressures give policy makers room to maintain a third round of unprecedented bond-buying aimed at spurring the expansion and reducing unemployment. Longer-term inflation expectations have “remained stable,” the Federal Open Market Committee said in an Oct. 24 statement after its meeting. Fed’s View “The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective,” the Fed officials said. Minutes of their last meeting, released yesterday, showed a number of officials said the central bank may need to expand its monthly purchases of bonds next year after the expiration of Operation Twist. The minutes also showed policy makers had a detailed discussion about whether the central bank should link its policy of holding the main interest rate at zero to numerical measurements of unemployment and inflation , an approach that participants “generally favored” over the current approach of specifying a calendar date through which rates will remain low. The CPI is the broadest of the three monthly price measures from the Labor Department because it includes goods and services. About 60 percent of the CPI covers prices consumers pay for services ranging from medical visits to airline fares and movie tickets. Producer prices, released yesterday, unexpectedly fell in October for the first time in five months as energy and vehicle costs dropped. The 0.2 percent decline followed a 1.1 percent increase the prior month. Import prices unexpectedly climbed in October, led by increases in energy expenses that have since been reversed. The 0.5 percent advance followed a 1.1 percent gain in September and a 1.2 percent rise in August, figures showed last week.

The 0.1 percent increase in the consumer-price index followed a 0.6 percent gain the prior month, the Labor Department reported today in Washington. The median estimate of 83 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.1 percent rise. The so-called core measure, which excludes more volatile food and energy costs, climbed 0.2 percent, more than projected, reflected rising rents and clothing costs. Macy’s Inc. (M) is among retailers planning holiday discounts, while Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) are battling to offer the best online prices on toys, indicating companies have little leeway to charge more. The inflation outlook is in sync with the Federal Reserve ’s view and gives policy makers room to concentrate on boosting growth. “Inflation in the U.S. is very subdued,” said Sal Guatieri , a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, who correctly forecast the gain in prices. “This is allowing the Fed to strive toward supporting job growth and reducing unemployment.” Bloomberg survey estimates for the consumer-price index ranged from a drop of 0.1 percent to an increase of 0.3 percent. In the 12 months ended in October, consumer prices rose 2.2 percent, the report showed. Core Prices The core CPI reading showed the biggest increase since June and compared with a 0.1 percent median forecast of economists surveyed. Core prices were up 2 percent for the year through October, the same as in the 12 months through September. A separate report from the Labor department showed more Americans than forecast submitted claims for unemployment insurance last week as superstorm Sandy wreaked havoc on the job market. Applications for jobless benefits surged by 78,000 to 439,000 in the week ended Nov. 10, the most since April 2011. Several states said the increase was due to the storm that hit the Northeastern part of the country in late October, a Labor Department spokesman said as the data were released to the press. Also today, manufacturing in the New York region contracted for a fourth straight month in November as Sandy knocked out electrical power and limited activity, figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shoed. Its general economic index was minus 5.2 this month compared with minus 6.2 in October. Readings of less than zero signal contraction in New York, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut.

German Growth Slowed Less Than Forecast in Third Quarter,['Stefan Riecher'],2012-11-15 10:14:12,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/german-growth-slowed-less-than-forecast-in-third-quarter.html,"German growth slowed less than forecast in the third quarter and the French economy unexpectedly expanded. German gross domestic product climbed 0.2 percent from the second quarter, when it gained 0.3 percent, the Federal Statistics Office said in Wiesbaden today. Economists predicted a 0.1 percent increase, according to the median of 46 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. In France , GDP rose 0.2 percent in the quarter, beating economists’ median forecast of zero growth. The better-than-expected reports from Europe’s two largest economies weren’t enough to prevent the euro area from slipping into recession. The 17-nation economy contracted 0.1 percent in the third quarter after shrinking 0.2 percent in the second, the European Union’s statistics office said today. “This was probably the last reasonably solid quarterly figure from Germany for a while,” said Joerg Kraemer , chief economist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “The steep fall in the leading indicators suggests that GDP will contract in the fourth quarter.” The euro rose after Germany’s GDP release and traded at $1.2757 at 11:12 a.m. in Frankfurt, up 0.2 percent. Growth Drivers German third-quarter expansion was driven by exports, construction and household and public spending, the statistics office said. Company investment in equipment and inventories declined. From a year earlier, the economy grew 0.9 percent when adjusted for working days. The statistics office will publish a full break-down of third-quarter GDP on Nov. 23. In France, growth was also driven by exports and consumer spending , while company investment fell. Second-quarter GDP was revised to a 0.1 percent decline from unchanged. “The third quarter is probably the result of a temporary rebound at the European level,” said Michel Martinez, an economist at Societe Generale in Paris. Business sentiment surveys suggest the French economy “is heading to a moderate recession or at best remaining flat,” he said. Spanish GDP dropped 0.3 percent in the third quarter for its fifth straight retreat. While the Italian economy also posted its fifth quarterly contraction, the GDP decline of 0.2 percent was less than half the 0.5 percent drop forecast by economists. Euro-Area Weakness Germany’s economic strength has helped to limit the impact of the sovereign debt crisis on euro-area GDP. The German economy will expand 0.8 percent this year and in 2013, according to the European Commission. It predicts French GDP will rise 0.2 percent this year and 0.4 percent next year. By contrast, the commission forecasts a 0.4 percent decline in euro-area GDP this year and just 0.1 percent growth next year. It expects annual economic contractions next year in six of the 17 euro nations. Germany sells about 40 percent of its products to the euro area and 60 percent to the wider European Union. Its exports to other euro-area countries slumped 9.1 percent in September from a year earlier. Factory orders and industrial production fell more than forecast in September and business confidence is at its lowest in more than 2 1/2 years. Foreign Sales Deutsche Post AG, Europe ’s largest postal service, said on Nov. 8 that third-quarter profit fell 6.5 percent as a pay increase caused spending to rise. “We see as well a slowdown of import and export volumes,” Chief Executive Officer Frank Appel said. “The German economy is not as strong as it has been in the past two years.” Hamburger Hafen & Logistik AG, the largest container handler at Hamburg’s port, cut investment plans for this year on Nov. 13 after the global economic slowdown hurt volume and caused third-quarter profit to fall 28 percent. Some German companies are compensating for weaker demand in Europe through sales to faster growing markets. Higher wages and unemployment of 6.9 percent -- close to a two-decade low -- are also helping to boost domestic spending. RWE AG, Germany’s second-largest utility, yesterday increased its full-year profit forecast. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG stands by its plans to increase 2012 profit, Chief Financial Officer Friedrich Eichiner said on Nov. 6. The world’s biggest maker of luxury cars posted third-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations, helped by growth in the U.S. and Asia. ECB Plan Financial markets have rallied since European Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged to do whatever it takes to save the euro and unveiled a plan to buy government bonds. Germany’s benchmark DAX share index has gained more than 11 percent since late July. Now, investors are waiting for Spain to request aid from Europe’s bailout fund, a prerequisite for the ECB to intervene in its debt markets. The Bundesbank said on Oct. 22 that there are “increasing signs” that Germany’s economy will stagnate or see “a slight decrease in gross domestic product in the final quarter of the year.” -- With assistance from Kristian Siedenburg in Vienna and Mark Deen in Paris.

"Ford Fusion Hybrid Rolls With Aston Martin Grill, 47 MPG",['Jason H.Harper'],2012-11-15 05:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/ford-fusion-hybrid-rolls-with-aston-martin-grill-47-mpg.html,"Driving through New Jersey in the days following Hurricane Sandy , I gaped at gas lines not seen in the U.S. since the 1970s. I was in a German sports car that sucked down gas by the keg, so I kept the pressure on the gas pedal light. How I wished for the super-efficient car I’d driven weeks before, in Michigan. Not a Toyota Prius or an all-electric Nissan Leaf, but a $28,000 Ford. The new Ford Fusion Hybrid gets 47 miles per gallon, both in the city and on the highway. With that kind of economy and its 13.5-gallon fuel tank, I could have whooshed between my homes in New York and Pennsylvania seven times without worrying about stopping at a gas station overseen by the National Guard. The hybrid is one of several powertrains offered in the brand-new Fusion. The low-end model starts at only $22,500, with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that gets 34 mpg highway. There are also two turbo-charged engines available, with 1.6 liters or 2.0 liters, that have more pep and still get up to 37 and 33 mpg. A plug-in hybrid will also be available down the line. Perhaps Ford (F) is doing penance for all the over-sized SUVs foisted upon us in the 1990s and 2000s, because they’re taking efficiency seriously. Aston Martin Ford’s ambition is for the Fusion to become as wildly popular as the Taurus once was. After all, it’s a mid-size sedan with a mid-size price and great gas mileage. (Ford still offers the Taurus, but it hasn’t been a big seller for years.) Completely revamped inside and out, the Fusion takes on the other middle-class stalwarts in the field, like the Toyota Corolla (which is as beige as a car that you’ll likely to find), the redesigned Honda Accord and the Nissan Altima. Too often mid-size cars are studies in bland design. The Fusion neatly avoids this foible by grafting on the front end of an Aston Martin. No, really. Take a look at the flat-faced, oval grill laced with horizontal lines, and note the uncanny resemblance to models found on Aston Martins, a high-end brand that Ford once owned. Would Mr. Skyfall himself be found driving it? Not terribly likely, as the novelty of the front end only goes so far. The Fusion looks sturdy, but it lacks overall harmony or any real sexiness. You really can’t hope for supercar proportions from a one-size-fits-all sedan. Lost Car Park it next to the Accord and Altima, and you’ll find that their shapes and dimensions are awfully alike. I don’t envy the guy who buys any one of the models in silver paint, and then forgets where he parked it at the shopping mall during Christmas. The similarities are due, in large part, to regulations, both in the U.S. and worldwide. Europe , for instance, has pedestrian impact regulations that require hoods to be a certain height and a crumple zone between the top of the engine and the hood. You can no longer get away with the kind of low hoods or rakish fins once found on cars of the 1950s and 1960s. And buyers want rear seats that are comfortable and an ample trunk. It’s no wonder that the result is a glut of mid- size cars that would look depressingly similar if you took away the different grills, the brightwork and the badges. Options Offer My Fusion Hybrid had options including navigation, adaptive cruise control and active parking assist, so it came to $34,770. I drove over three days around Michigan , starting at an early hour. It was very dark and quite chilly and the roads were empty. Once the heater kicked on and the car warmed, so too did I to the hybrid system. I’m generally lukewarm on hybrids. Tricks with gas engines like direct fuel injection and turbo-charging have offset the gas mileage perks of a hybrid, which has to carry a load of heavy batteries. Hybrids are best around town. The Fusion cruised capably on the highway, however, the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine spinning merrily in the background. The electric motors added more juice on demand, for a total of 188 horsepower, and I had no issues powering past other cars. The continuous variable transmission is exceptionally well- mated to the powertrain, and all the systems work quietly and without vibration. The car drives really nicely, and isn’t too loud, even on hills. The top-of-the-line Fusion with the turbocharged 2.0-liter engine has 240 horsepower and 270 pound-feet of torque. That would have been nice, but I might have had to stop for gas -- something I never even had to consider over 400 miles of driving the hybrid. I didn’t, however, actually see 47 mpg. With my typically leaden foot, I averaged 36.9 mpg. No worries, I have only myself to blame. The 2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid at a Glance Engine: 2.0-liter four-cylinder and a 35kW electric motor with a combined 188 horsepower. Transmission: Continuous variable. Speed: 0 to 60 mph in about nine seconds. Gas mileage per gallon: 47 city, 47 highway. Price as tested: $34,770. Best feature: That gas mileage!

U.S. Solves Its Oil Glut Dilemma,['Evan Soltas'],2013-07-21 15:22:25,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-21/u-s-solves-its-oil-glut-dilemma.html,"For the first time in nearly three years, the price of crude oil is higher in the U.S. than in Europe. And, believe it or not, that's great news. Energy investors closely track the difference, or spread, between the so-called West Texas Intermediate spot price in the U.S. and the Brent price in Europe. The spread has vanished over the past few months. Historically, oil has traded at a slight premium in the U.S. over Europe. Then, in 2010, North American oil production grew much more quickly than anyone expected -- including companies that manage oil pipelines and transportation. Domestic demand also remained surprisingly weak. American prices dropped $20 below world levels because it became impossible to get all the oil out of the middle of the country quickly and cheaply. Does the end of that spread mean slightly higher prices for American drivers? Probably not. U.S. gasoline prices are determined by world oil and gasoline prices (as well as the cost of transporting gas from refineries). The fact that U.S. oil is now flowing more freely from what had been a midcontinent bottleneck should be a good thing for American drivers. Oil trades on a world market, where a $20-a-barrel discount simply should not exist. It costs a fraction of that amount to transport oil across thousands of miles by pipeline, by rail, and maybe even by truck, according to Jim Hamilton, an economics professor at University of California San Diego. The U.S. hadn't been making the most productive use of its oil bounty. The lack of enough transportation for oil production was a de-facto interstate trade barrier, preventing the flow of oil across the country, which had to continue oil imports. That barrier is beginning to come down, and the inventory glut is shrinking quickly. Oil producers have turned to railcars to transport crude from North Dakota, in one major change, as railways have expanded their capacity more quickly than have pipelines. Pipelines, too, are expanding and re-routing. Many new ones are now under construction as oil producers ink long-term contracts with pipeline firms. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show that the volume of oil going from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast has grown threefold since 2005. Clearly, the markets think the U.S. is taking care of its oil glut. (Evan Soltas is a contributor to the Ticker.

Toyota Affiliate Targets Hyundai Sales in Supply Shift,['Rose Kim' 'Anna Mukai'],2013-07-21 16:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-21/toyota-affiliate-targets-hyundai-sales-in-supply-shift.html,"On July 1, Nobuaki Katoh became an honorary citizen of South Korea. That’s remarkable not only because he hails from regional rival Japan, but also because he runs the top component supplier for Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the biggest competitor of Korean champion Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  Katoh, president of Denso Corp. (6902) , partly owned by Toyota, got the citizenship certificate at a groundbreaking ceremony for his company’s new Korean factory. The plant, which will supply Hyundai and its sister enterprises, illustrates a shift in the auto parts industry, from suppliers linked closely to one car manufacturer to a handful of global giants that build components for multiple automakers. “Suppliers are diversifying because they want to reduce the risks that come with being too dependent on one automaker, and to strengthen their price negotiating power,” said Lee Sang Hyun, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities Co. (016420)  Denso’s South Korean expansion comes as Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) , Delphi Automotive Plc (DLPH) and Robert Bosch GmbH , Denso’s largest global rivals, build up their presence in Japan with plans to win Toyota business. The change is being driven by automakers themselves. Toyota, for instance, is seeking new suppliers to help it winnow parts variety globally and reduce the risk of parts shortages after natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods. And Hyundai this year diversified its supplier base when it contracted with Denso to make heaters for its Sonata sedan in the U.S. Windshield Projectors The reshuffle is driving expansion at parts makers across Asia and shaking up the supply chains of auto producers. Japan imported more auto parts in June than in any month since October 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Johnson Controls, the world’s largest producer of car seats and batteries, is expanding in Japan. Germany’s Bosch has said it expects to benefit as Toyota cuts its reliance on Japanese suppliers in favor of larger global companies. And French component maker Faurecia SA is expanding in China and the U.S. as its controlling shareholder, PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) , suffers and the European market continues to contract. Denso, which makes components ranging from seats to electronic controls to air conditioners, intends to plow 400 billion won ($350 million) into South Korea by 2020. The company supplies Korean clients with smart keys that can automatically unlock doors at a distance and devices that project information on the windshield. Denso declined to provide an executive for comment. Sonata Heaters Hyundai Mobis Co. (012330) , Korea’s biggest partsmaker and an affiliate of Hyundai Motor, is countering Denso’s move by boosting its own overseas expansion. The company aims to become the world’s fifth largest auto-parts maker by 2020, up from No. 8 today, by winning contracts from carmakers in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Hyundai supplier Halla Visteon Climate Control Corp. (018880) is also seeking to broaden its customer base. The partsmaker, which counts on Hyundai and its affiliates for half of revenue, lost out to Denso for making heaters for Hyundai’s Sonata sedan in the U.S. Now, the company says it has clinched enough non-Hyundai orders to keep sales rising at least 7 percent annually for the next three years. “We have a very good customer mix,” said Halla Chief Executive Officer Park Yong Hwan. “The market had been concerned about our high dependency on Hyundai and we felt we needed to secure more customers and expand in other markets.” Delphi, the former parts unit of General Motors Co., says changes in the way Toyota and Honda Motor Co. buy parts is opening the way for the company to build market share in Japan. Chaebol Busting “We’ve recently won a fair amount of business with Toyota and Honda where we actually are taking share,” Kevin Clark, Delphi chief financial officer, said at a Barclays Plc conference earlier this year. He didn’t elaborate on the contracts. The tradition of carmakers owning large stakes in their suppliers has come under scrutiny in South Korea, where the government is trying to weaken the chaebol, or family-run conglomerates, while encouraging Japanese companies to do more business in the country. “Japanese partsmakers are looking for room to grow and expand their customer lineup,” said Shin Chung Kwan, an analyst at KB Investment & Securities Co. Denso’s expansion into South Korea comes as the partsmaker looks to cut its earthquake risk, said Shin. The magnitude-9 temblor that rocked northeastern Japan in March 2011 disrupted production and led to component shortages that have prompted automakers to diversify sourcing geographically. Faltering Alliances Denso is also expanding production in North America , Cambodia and Poland and has said that it will pay about $1.9 million for 51 percent of Pricol Components Ltd., an Indian maker of instrument clusters for cars. While old alliances break down, the new ones will probably increase the market power of the biggest partsmakers, said Masahiro Akita, an analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG in Tokyo.

Americans Absorb Payroll-Tax Rise to Keep Spending: Economy,['Shobhana Ch' 'ra' 'Rich Miller'],2013-03-11 20:17:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/americans-take-payroll-tax-increase-in-stride-to-keep-spending.html,"Consumers and businesses are treating higher payroll taxes and federal spending cuts as just a speed bump for a U.S. economy poised to accelerate later this year. Americans are saving less and spending more for purchases such as new automobiles , as household net worth climbs with rising home values and stock indexes surging to record highs. Companies are ramping up hiring, adding 246,000 to private payrolls in February. They’re also expanding investment and rebuilding inventories as they put profits accumulated during the recovery to work. “A lot of things are going the right way,” said Brian Jones , a senior U.S. economist at Societe Generale in New York, whose private employment forecast was closest to the February gain among economists surveyed by Bloomberg. “The labor market is picking up momentum. Businesses are seeing demand. More people working means more people will be spending money. To a certain extent, this neutralizes the effects” of higher taxes. Growth will pick up in the second half of the year as the fallout from the budget cuts dissipates, paving the way for even stronger spending by businesses and consumers, projections from Barclays Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. show. Gross domestic product will rise at a 2 percent annual average pace in the latter six months of 2013 after a 1.5 percent rate in the first two quarters, said Dean Maki , chief U.S. economist at Barclays. “The economy is at a point where it can handle the fiscal tightening without screeching to a halt,” said New York-based Maki, who is also a former Federal Reserve board economist. “We’ll see some slowing, certainly, but the economy is not as fragile as it was.” Stock Prices Shares rose today on the improving economic outlook, reversing earlier losses caused by signs foreign economies were off to a weak start in 2013. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.3 percent to 1,556.22 at the close in New York. China’s industrial output had the weakest start to a year since 2009 and lending and retail sales growth slowed, government data showed Match 9. In France, industrial production fell more than expected in January as Europe’s second-largest economy teetered on the brink of its third recession in four years. Even as Congress is forcing Brent Phipps’s employer, the U.S. government, to reduce spending by $85 billion this fiscal year, the 25-year-old paralegal is still going shopping. Browsing through an aisle of neon green, pink and transparent plastic storage containers at a Target Corp. (TGT) store in Washington, Phipps, who works for the Justice Department, said the payroll tax increase hasn’t altered his spending habits. Tax Impact “I didn’t really pay any attention to it,” he said. “I can’t say I had any particular, ‘oh no, I’m not going to do X, Y and Z thing.’” Americans are opening their wallets for bigger-ticket purchases too. General Motors Co. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. (F) predict automobile sales , on pace for the best year since 2007, will remain resilient. Cars and light trucks sold at a 15.3 million annual rate in February after 15.2 million a month earlier, according to Ward’s Automotive Group. “Consumers appear to be taking higher payroll taxes in stride, at least when it comes to replacing older vehicles,” Kurt McNeil, vice president of U.S. sales operations for Detroit-based GM, said on a March 1 conference call. Furniture Sales Norris Home Furnishings, a Fort Myers, Florida-based furniture retailer with three stores, exceeded its goal for 15 percent sales gains in January and February from a year earlier, company owner Larry Norris said. Rising home prices in the region have improved consumer attitudes even in the face of higher taxes, the 70-year-old business owner said. “People are a lot more cautious with their money than they were at one time, but they are still spending,” he said. “Consumer attitudes are improving, no question.” Retailers Gap Inc. and Limited Brands Inc. each reported sales at stores open at least a year rose 3 percent in February, exceeding analysts’ forecasts. Gap also owns the Banana Republic and Old Navy store chains, while Limited’s brands include Victoria’s Secret. Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) , the largest U.S. warehouse-club chain, reported a 6 percent jump that also topped analyst estimates. The improving sales outlook is encouraging businesses to expand and add workers. Lowe’s Cos., the second-largest U.S. home-improvement retailer, is boosting spending on store upgrades and hiring. The Mooresville, North Carolina-based company said it plans to open 10 stores in 2013. Employment Pickup Labor Department data released on March 8 showed overall hiring jumped by 236,000 last month after 119,000 in January, and the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent , a four-year low. Together with a gain in average hourly earnings and a longer workweek, the latest figures bode well for consumer spending , which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. A report today indicated job gains will continue. The Conference Board’s Employment Trends Index increased 1.1 percent in February, the biggest advance in a year. The gauge aggregates eight labor-market indicators to forecast short-term hiring trends. On average, it can signal a rebound in hiring as little as three months before the fact and can predict job declines six to nine months in advance, according to the New York-based research group. Americans also are benefiting from rising stock and home prices. Household wealth climbed in the fourth quarter to the highest level in five years, according to Fed data. At $66.1 trillion, net worth for households and non-profit groups is approaching its pre-recession peak of $67.4 trillion reached in 2007. Big Plus “It’s definitely a big plus for the economic outlook,” said Joe Carson , director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein LP in New York, who predicts net worth will climb to a record this quarter. The S&P 500 (SPX) index has advanced 9.1 percent since the beginning of 2013 to reach the highest level in more than five years today. It is less than 10 points from its record high reached in October 2007. Further gains are likely, and the stock gauge may climb to 1,600 later this year, said Allen Sinai , chief global economist at Decision Economics Inc. in New York. The higher equity prices and improving job market are boosting consumer confidence. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort (COMFCOMF) Index, up for a fifth week, is at its highest level of the year, and the share of Americans with a positive view of the economy held at its strongest reading since early 2008. Ski Vacation Ann B. Lally, an Atlanta digital marketing consultant, said she’ll spend a “few thousand dollars” on a weeklong ski vacation to Deer Valley, Utah, later this month with her sister and mother. While taxes have been raised this year, “we have planned accordingly,” she said. “I have budgeted for it. I love to ski -- and I am not a big spender.” One reason purchases are likely to hold up in the face of higher taxes is that affluent consumers, who make up a disproportionately large share of spending, tend to trim savings rather than consumption when faced with such constraints, economists at UBS Securities LLC said. They estimate the top 1 percent of income earners put 51 cents of each dollar toward savings, allowing plenty of leeway to keep spending. Recent data show this is already happening. Consumer spending rose in January even as incomes dropped by the most in 20 years, pushing the saving rate to a five-year low. Business Fortress Like households, companies are in better shape than they were a few years ago to ride out the drag from the $85 billion in across-the-board budget cuts, known as sequestration, that began this month. “Businesses have fortress balance sheets,” Sinai said. Profits for corporations in the S&P 500 index climbed to a record $100.75 a share in 2012, and will exceed $120 a share next year, double the $60.43 seen in 2008, according to Wall Street estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The cash is stoking investment as corporate confidence and demand improve. Orders (CGNOXAI%) for non-military capital goods excluding aircraft, a proxy for future business spending on equipment and software, climbed 7.2 percent in January from the prior month, the biggest gain since September 2004. They’re up 9.8 percent since November, the most for a three-month period since 1993. ‘Opportunities Abound’ “We will keep our foot to the floor and will almost certainly set still another record for capital expenditures in 2013,” Warren Buffett , chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , wrote in an annual letter to shareholders posted online March 1. “Opportunities abound in America.” Buffett said his Omaha, Nebraska-based company last year spent $9.8 billion, an increase of about 19 percent from 2011, on plants and equipment as he bolstered railroad and utility units. In another sign of growing confidence, manufacturers are trying to rebuild inventories and farm stockpiles also will catch up after the hit from last year’s drought, according to UBS. This will add about 0.6 percentage point to first-half economic growth, said Drew Matus , deputy U.S. chief economist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut. While the economy faces some drags, “people are ignoring the positives,” he said. “We’re holding up better than people thought,” said Matus, who is also a former Federal Reserve Bank of New York analyst. “Never count out the U.S. consumer. Households are doing what they do, which is to spend money.” He said that’s part of the reason why “the first half isn’t looking awful, and the second half should end better.” To contact the reporters on this story: Shobhana Chandra in Washington at schandra1@bloomberg.net ; Rich Miller in Washington at rmiller28@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chris Wellisz at cwellisz@bloomberg.net",['Shobhana ChraRich Miller'],"Americans Absorb Payroll-Tax Rise to Keep Spending: Economy Consumers and businesses are treating higher payroll taxes and federal spending cuts as just a speed bump for a U.S. economy poised to accelerate later this year.

This will add about 0.6 percentage point to first-half economic growth, said Drew Matus , deputy U.S. chief economist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut. While the economy faces some drags, “people are ignoring the positives,” he said. “We’re holding up better than people thought,” said Matus, who is also a former Federal Reserve Bank of New York analyst. “Never count out the U.S. consumer. Households are doing what they do, which is to spend money.” He said that’s part of the reason why “the first half isn’t looking awful, and the second half should end better.” To contact the reporters on this story: Shobhana Chandra in Washington at schandra1@bloomberg.net ; Rich Miller in Washington at rmiller28@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chris Wellisz at cwellisz@bloomberg.net",10006,1639,9
Nissan COO to Head Electric Car Unit as Leaf Sales Trail Target,['Ma Jie'],2013-03-11 15:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/nissan-coo-to-head-electric-car-unit-as-leaf-sales-trail-target.html,"Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan ’s second- largest automaker, put its electric-vehicle business under the direct supervision of the chief operating officer after sales of the Leaf missed the company’s expectations. Toshiyuki Shiga will oversee zero emission vehicle strategy and the battery business starting April 1, Nissan said in an e- mail. Hideaki Watanabe, corporate vice president at the electric car division, was moved to supplier Calsonic Kansei Corp. (7248) , where he will be senior vice president. Deliveries of Nissan’s flagship electric car in the U.S. failed to reach even half of the 20,000 units the Yokohama, Japan-based automaker had targeted last year. Lower-than- anticipated demand for zero-emission cars has been a blow to Nissan Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn, who’s forecast that electric cars would become so popular that they’d account for at least 10 percent of global auto sales by the end of the decade. “Chief Operating Officer Shiga is taking direct responsibility of zero emission efforts because the business is Nissan’s top priority which requires global and cross-functional efforts,” Chris Keeffe, a spokesman for the carmaker said by phone, declining to elaborate on the personnel changes. Nissan cut prices of the Leaf, improved its battery range and introduced an entry-level model last year to boost sales.

U.S. Offers GPS Training for Truckers to Avoid Bridges,['Jeff Plungis'],2013-03-11 19:00:15,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/u-s-offers-gps-training-for-truckers-to-avoid-bridges.html,"The U.S. Transportation Department will require global-positioning system training for new commercial drivers and offer guidelines for existing operators to reduce the number of trucks and buses striking bridges. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration announced the program today at a Southern State Parkway bridge on New York ’s Long Island that’s been struck 27 times by trucks too tall to travel on the road. U.S. Senator Charles Schumer , a New York Democrat, led efforts to get more training for drivers. “These steps will help to once again make GPS devices an asset to drivers, and not a dangerously misused tool,” Schumer said. Truckers following faulty GPS directions have hit bridges in New York City , Long Island and Westchester County more than 200 times a year since 2005, Schumer said. About 80 percent of the bridge strikes in New York, where parkways built decades ago with low overpasses are supposed to be closed to commercial traffic, are caused by drivers being misdirected by GPS devices onto roads they shouldn’t enter, Schumer said. Even if roads are well-marked, GPS devices may not note restrictions for trucks and buses, he said. U.S. regulators believe truckers are using navigation systems for passenger cars instead of ones written for big rigs and buses, Duane DeBruyne, an FMCSA spokesman, said. The agency wants commercial drivers to use devices listing route restrictions such as bridge heights, he said. “Even one truck or bus striking an overpass is one too many, which is why we’re taking action,” FMCSA Administrator Anne Ferro said in a statement. Consumer GPS The FMCSA will begin distributing GPS training recommendations, including how to select professional-grade navigation systems, instructions on how to input truck sizes and axle weights, and tips on avoiding distracted driving, Schumer said. In addition, the agency will require GPS training for new operators seeking commercial-driver certification, Schumer said. That will be included later this year in a regulation Congress required in last year’s surface transportation law. Many truck drivers who end up on parkways with restrictions on commercial traffic are relying on consumer GPS units, and some use Google Inc.’s Google Maps, according to a September 2011 report by the New York State Department of Transportation. In New York suburbs such as Westchester County and Long Island , bridges over roads such as the Hutchinson River and Saw Mill River parkways may have clearances of less than 10 feet. In New York City, 110 bridges were struck in 2010 and 2011. On Long Island, 94 bridges were struck during the same period, Schumer said. Repairs on the Long Island Expressway alone due to truck- bridge accidents have cost $4.1 million, Schumer said. In addition, the state has spent $3 million for 300 bridge warning signs, he said. According to Transportation Department data , there were 15,000 bridge strikes by all types of vehicles in the U.S. in 2010, resulting in 214 deaths and 3,000 injuries.

"Golden Woman Hangs Upside Down, Pours Napa Valley Wine",['Elin Mc Coy'],2013-03-11 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/golden-woman-hangs-upside-down-pours-napa-valley-wine.html,"“We’re trending above Nascar and the Oscars on twitter,” crows auctioneer Fritz Hatton, as he opens the 17th Premiere Napa Valley trade barrel auction with sharp bangs of his gavel. Everyone cheers, primed to bid big on cabernet after a week of wooing by vintners at tastings and parties. The wildest event was Raymond Vineyards’ “Napa Gras,” where a woman in long black gloves and abbreviated gold body suit poured wine while hanging upside down. Napa’s annual February event serves as a barometer of demand for expensive Napa cabs, which seems to mirror the mood on Wall Street. Since this year’s Feb. 23 auction hit a near- record $3.04 million, the Dow has continued to set new highs. The 211 one-of-a-kind, not-yet-bottled cuvees offered in five, 10, or 20-case lots represent each winery’s best of the best. Most are cabernets from the 2011 vintage, so the pre- auction tastings provide a gauge to the year’s overall quality and an opportunity to scout out the valley’s hot new names. The big room at the Culinary Institute of America in St. Helena is crowded with rowdy retailers, restaurateurs, importers, distributors and media from 39 states and nine countries. Ichizo Nakagawa, owner of Tokyo ’s Nakagawa Wine Co. Ltd., which specializes in California wine, is sporting a bright orange jacket and shirt with a wild striped tie and a golfer’s tan. Number Cruncher His son Sei, a former bond trader who is now company president, keeps an eye on the spreadsheet open on his white laptop and the auction catalog. Nakagawa used to design golf courses and run the family lumber business, sampled his first California wine in the 1970s, and started his wine business in 1985. “Once I tasted Ridge Vineyards cabernet I stopped drinking Chateau Latour ,” Nakagawa says, as his son translates. “I perceived huge potential for California wine in the Japanese market. It’s a useful tool for networking. You can drink it without food.” Immortalized at home as a California wine expert in the influential Japanese wine manga series “Drops of God” (Kami no Shizuku), Nakagawa is equally famous in Napa. Chateau Lafite His winning $125,000 bid in 2011 for five cases of 2009 Scarecrow, the highest ever bid at Premiere, drew a standing ovation and a flood of emails from buyers. That’s $2,083 a bottle, more than a 2009 Chateau Lafite costs today. “High-end Japanese people want rare California wines they can’t purchase easily,” he says. So do Americans. Robert Trone, co-owner of Total Wine & More , an independent wine retailer with 89 superstores, paid $75,000 for the most expensive lot, 10 cases of the luscious 2011 “We Will Rock You” cabernet blend from Bevan Cellars and Chateau Boswell Winery. He also splashed out $50,000 for five cases ($833 a bottle) of tannic, powerful 2011 Shafer Sunspot Vineyard cabernet, produced from the tiny parcel of land that also provides the heart of their cult cab Hillside Select. “It’s for a good cause,” Trone says, with a grin. Auction proceeds help fund the Napa Valley Vintners association. Nakagawa is more cautious. “This year is complicated,” he says. “2011 is not the greatest year. 2012 is better.” Still, he bought five cases of plush 2011 Revana Family Vineyard Premier Cuvee cabernet (one of my top wines) for $15,000 and another five of spicy 2011 Lewis Cellars cabernet for $26,000, among other lots. Cellar Stocker Like most auction buyers here, Nakagawa has commissions from customers for specific lots; the rest of his purchases will fatten his inventory. I was more impressed than I expected with the 2011 vintage, a year vintners spin as “challenging,” due to heavy rains right before harvest. Winemakers who picked early or managed to prevent mildew and rot, made delicious wines that have lovely, juicy fruit, bright acidity, and aren’t buried under the high alcohol that often plagues Napa cabs. On the other hand, many wineries failed to get it right. My top picks among these 2011s include the complex earth- and-cherry 2011 Corison Winery Premiere Reserve; the bright, rich, cassis-flecked 2011 Kapcsandy Family Winery cabernet; a dark, intense 2011 Spottswoode Estate Vineyard & Winery cabernet; silky-textured 2011 Notre Vin winery’s “One Hundred Vines” cabernet; and the concentrated, plummy 2011 Continuum Estate cab blend. Opulent Cabernet I also made some new impressive discoveries: the supple, elegant 2011 St. Helena Winery cabernet sauvignon, just its second vintage; a pure, violet-scented 2011 Detert Family Vineyards cabernet franc, made from 60-year-old vines; and the ripe, opulent 2011 Patel Tourmaline Vineyard cabernet. Tracking down Premiere wines outside the auction used to be tough, though now the Napa Valley Vintners posts on its website the names of the winning bidders for each lot. Now may be a good time to contact them if you want to buy before the Dow climbs any higher. (Elin McCoy writes on wine and spirits for Muse, the arts and leisure section of Bloomberg News.

Pimco-Led Peso Bulls Cheer One-and-Done Rate Cut: Mexico Credit,['Ben Bain' 'Eric Martin'],2013-03-11 14:42:46,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/pimco-led-peso-bulls-cheer-one-and-done-rate-cut-mexico-credit.html,"Foreign investors banking on currency gains to amplify their Mexican debt returns can breathe easier after the central bank signaled its first interest-rate cut since 2009 would be a one-time reduction. The peso jumped 1 percent in the biggest advance since Jan. 2 after the bank lowered its benchmark rate by a half-percentage point to 4 percent. The currency’s gain boosted returns on Mexico’s peso-denominated government bonds to 6.6 percent this year in dollar terms, six times the average in emerging markets , according to Bank of America Corp. Policy makers led by central bank Governor Agustin Carstens said the rate cut “doesn’t represent the start of a cycle,” bolstering confidence the bank will keep rates on hold for now and reducing the likelihood looser monetary policy will erode the allure of local-currency debt for foreigners. Mexico’s bond market attracted a record $8.78 billion last year from overseas investors tracked by EPFR Global as they sought to profit from steady interest rates and growth that outpaced Brazil’s for a second year. “It’s not the beginning of an easing cycle,” Claudio Irigoyen, the head of Latin America fixed-income and foreign- exchange strategy at Bank of America, said in a telephone interview from New York. “You had a rally in the currency because people said, ‘OK, this is a one-off and therefore the cut story is out of the way.’” Yields Fall Bill Gross , Pacific Investment Management Co.’s co-chief investment officer, said last month the peso was a “great currency” while praising the nation’s low debt level and interest-rate stability. Pimco is the biggest owner of peso bonds due in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. E-mail and voice messages left today with Pimco’s press office weren’t immediately returned. Yields on bonds due in December fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to a record 4.11 percent on March 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The peso’s 1 percent rally pushed it to 12.6279 per dollar, its strongest close since Feb. 1. Mexico trimmed rates for the first time in more than three years after signaling in January that slowing inflation made loosening monetary policy “advisable.” While 21 of 22 analysts in a survey released last week by Citigroup Inc.’s local Banamex unit expected a rate reduction this year, the median estimate was for a 0.5 percentage point cut in April. First Cut Carstens’s first rate cut was forecast by seven of 25 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The rest predicted the rate would stay on hold. Latin America’s second-largest economy was the only nation in the Group of 20 to leave borrowing costs unchanged and refrain from buying bonds to ease monetary conditions since July 2009. Cost-of-living increases have been below the 4 percent ceiling of the central bank’s target range for three straight months, with the rate at 3.55 percent in the year through February. In its policy statement, the bank said the cut shouldn’t prevent inflation from slowing to the bank’s target of 3 percent. Its target range is one percentage point below and above the central target. Alberto Bernal, the head of fixed-income research at Bulltick Capital Markets in Miami, says the rate cut hasn’t shaken his bullish outlook on Mexican peso debt and predicts that the currency will appreciate further. ‘Inflation Jolts’ “What I’m recommending to my clients, is to go aggressive into the long end of the curve,” he said by telephone. Yields on Mexico ’s benchmark bonds maturing 2024 increased five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.01 percent on March 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on the country’s longest-dated peso bond, those maturing in 2042, surged nine basis points to 6.02 percent. Enrique Alvarez, the head of Latin America fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal in New York, says investors in longer- maturity bonds may have sold their debt on March 8 on concern that lower borrowing costs will accelerate inflation and erode returns. “By lowering rates you’re exposing higher inflation jolts further ahead,” he said in a telephone interview. The rate cut also means “you have less elements that are going to support a stronger peso.” The extra yield investors demand to own Mexican dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries was unchanged today at 169 basis points at 8:10 a.m. in Mexico City, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBIG index. Mexico’s peso increased 0.5 percent to 12.5682 per dollar. Default Swaps The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for five years with credit-default swaps dropped one basis point to 93 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on interbank rate futures due in December, known as TIIE, fell two basis points to 4.45 percent on March 8. Bernd Berg, a currency strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich, said lower borrowing costs will help boost domestic growth and ultimately support the peso’s appreciation. “Mexico’s growth rates will outperform other regional players like Brazil ,” Berg said in an e-mailed response to questions. “Strong U.S. data in combination with domestic growth boosted by the rate cut are supportive for peso appreciation as capital flows will continue to flow in.” To contact the reporters on this story: Ben Bain in Mexico City at  bbain2@bloomberg.net ; Eric Martin in Mexico City at  emartin21@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael Tsang at  mtsang1@bloomberg.net ; David Papadopoulos at  papadopoulos@bloomberg.net",['Ben BainEric Martin'],"Pimco-Led Peso Bulls Cheer One-and-Done Rate Cut: Mexico Credit Foreign investors banking on currency gains to amplify their Mexican debt returns can breathe easier after the central bank signaled its first interest-rate cut since 2009 would be a one-time reduction.

Bernd Berg, a currency strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich, said lower borrowing costs will help boost domestic growth and ultimately support the peso’s appreciation. “Mexico’s growth rates will outperform other regional players like Brazil ,” Berg said in an e-mailed response to questions. “Strong U.S. data in combination with domestic growth boosted by the rate cut are supportive for peso appreciation as capital flows will continue to flow in.” To contact the reporters on this story: Ben Bain in Mexico City at  bbain2@bloomberg.net ; Eric Martin in Mexico City at  emartin21@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael Tsang at  mtsang1@bloomberg.net ; David Papadopoulos at  papadopoulos@bloomberg.net",5608,908,-1

China Passenger-Vehicle Sales Top Estimates as India Demand Dips,['Bloomberg News'],2013-03-11 18:31:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/china-february-passenger-vehicle-sales-beat-estimates-on-suvs.html,"China ’s passenger-vehicle market had its strongest start since 2010, while sales in India shrank for a third month, illustrating the contrast in automobile demand in the world’s two most populous nations. China’s wholesale deliveries of cars, multipurpose and sport-utility vehicles, rose 20 percent to 2.84 million units in January and February, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. India’s passenger vehicle deliveries in the same period fell 11 percent to 468,914 units, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. Car sales in China and India, where one in three people in the world live, are diverging. Ford Motor Co. (F) and Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , which reported deliveries in China surged more than 40 percent during the first two months, introduced new variants and offered discounts helping the car market buck the slowing growth seen in overall Chinese retail sales and industrial output. In India, the two automakers posted declines in sales. “The numbers reconfirm that India is still a minor operation in the global scheme of things, whereas earnings for companies are very dependent on China,” said Ashvin Chotai , managing director of Intelligence Automotive Asia in London. “The only similarity between India and China are their large populations.” Japanese Slump While sales in the world’s biggest car market fell last month because of the Lunar New Year holidays, they beat the average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg by 11 percent. General Motors Co. (GM) ’s China sales rose 7.9 percent to 525,835 vehicles during January and February, widening its lead over Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) in the country. Toyota, Nissan Motor Co. (7201) and Honda Motor Co. reported declines in January-to-February sales, as Japanese auto brands continued to struggle with a consumer backlash sparked by a territorial dispute over a group of disputed islands. Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi, the top-selling luxury brand in China, said its China sales rose 16 percent in the first two months. Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz said its January-February sales in China and Hong Kong fell 39 percent from a year earlier to 26,829 vehicles. German brands gained market share in China in February, accounting for 20 percent of passenger-vehicle sales last month, followed by American, Japanese and South Korean nameplates, according to Chen Shihua, head of statistics at the auto association. Local brands remain weak and cars sold by these companies are mainly low-priced, FAW Group Chairman Xu Jianyi said at a meeting of the National People’s Congress in Beijing on Mar. 6. Worsening Pollution Li Weidou, head of export and import business at state- owned China FAW Group Corp.

The auto industry may face increasing restrictions in China as the central and provincial governments step up efforts to deal with air pollution and traffic congestion. Pollution has become a focus of the two-week session of the National People’s Congress now under way in Beijing, with Premier Wen Jiabao saying March 5 the country must balance economic development with environmental protection. State media have criticized the government this year for failing to sufficiently address the problem of tainted soil, air and water. Demand for vehicle license plates in Shanghai still outstrips supply despite auction prices exceeding 80,000 yuan ($12,865), which are “too expensive,” Shanghai Party Chief Han Zheng said at the People’s Congress. ‘Bottoming Out’ Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the local unit of Suzuki Motor Corp. in the South Asian nation, closed one of its factories for a day last week to pare inventory. The automaker’s deliveries in India fell 3.7 percent to 200,981 units in the first two months of this year. Hyundai’s sales in the January-February period in India declined 3.4 percent to 68,304. Ford’s India deliveries declined 39 percent to 10,552 units. Tata Motors Ltd., maker of the world’s cheapest car, the Nano, reported a 63 percent drop in passenger-vehicle sales through January and February. “We still hope we’re bottoming out and hope we’ll improve in future,” said Sugato Sen, the deputy director general of India’s automakers group. Local deliveries fell 4.6 percent in the 11 months ended in February, according to the group, and are set to post an annual decline for the first time in a decade. Asia’s third-biggest economy expanded 4.5 percent in the three months through Dec. 31 from a year earlier, the weakest pace in almost four years, a report showed Feb. 28.

India Car Sales Poised for First Fall in Decade on Demand,['Karthikeyan Sundaram' 'Siddharth Philip'],2013-03-11 09:15:22,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/india-car-sales-poised-for-first-fall-in-decade-on-demand.html,"India’s annual car sales are poised to decline for the first time in a decade as faster inflation, slowing economic growth and high interest rates continue to keep buyers from showrooms. Local deliveries declined 4.6 percent to 1.71 million cars in the 11 months ended in February, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. Annual deliveries last declined in the year ended March 2003, the group said. Carmakers from Suzuki Motor Corp.

Portugal’s $9 Million Villas Draw Investors to Crisis: Mortgages,['Henrique Almeida'],2013-03-12 11:31:56,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/portugal-s-9-million-villas-draw-investors-to-crisis-mortgages.html,"At “ The Keys ,” a cluster of luxury villas on the Atlantic coast modelled on Miami’s palm- tree resorts, builders and gardeners are busy trying to finish before the summer tourist season. The $300 million investment is on the other side of the ocean from Florida , at Quinta do Lago in the Algarve region of Portugal , a country more synonymous of late with economic collapse than new real-estate projects. The villas are on sale for as much as 7 million euros ($9 million) each and a quarter have buyers, according to the developer, U.K.-based E3 Property. “The recession was very strong, but based on our sales in Portugal, we now feel there’s a strengthening of the prime property market,” said Mark Lenherr, who runs the company. Sun, sand and golf have long attracted tourists to Portugal, with the Algarve accounting for one in three visitors. As property prices fall after the overbuilding of hotels and resorts that never filled up, investors are now picking over the debris from Europe ’s financial crisis, including funds acquiring soured commercial mortgages from banks and a Saudi sheikh returning to the market. While investment in Portuguese real estate is still down more than 50 percent from the 2007 peak, it rose 68 percent to 424.5 million euros in 2012, according to data compiled by realtor Cushman & Wakefield Inc. Three-quarters of the investment was in residential property, boosted by banks selling non-performing loans to funds, said Luis Rocha Antunes, the firm’s director of investment in Lisbon. Saudi Sheikh “While we remain cautious about the real estate market amid a weak economy in Portugal, we expect investment volumes to increase this year,” Antunes said. Saudi Sheikh Mohamed bin Issa al Jaber is looking at four- and five-star hotels in Portugal, he said while visiting the country this month. Al Jaber, Saudi Arabia ’s third-richest man based on data compiled by Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, may sell some budget hotels that are no longer part of the strategy of his company, JJW Hotels & Resorts Ltd. He declined to say which assets he may sell or buy. “Where there are difficulties there will always be opportunities,” Al Jaber said by telephone. MBI International & Partners Inc., the holding company founded by Al Jaber that controls JJW Hotels, bought three resorts in the Algarve in 2008 from Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT) for $268 million. In February, he repaid all his mortgage debt to Portuguese banks. Carlton Group Clients of the Carlton Group Inc., a U.S. real-estate investment bank, set aside 7.5 billion euros for purchases in Spain and Portugal over the next 12 to 18 months as the risk of a euro break-up diminishes and prices adjust to what buyers expect to pay, said Javier Beltran, who’s in charge of Carlton’s Iberian operation. “Since the beginning of this year, the prospects for Portugal’s real estate market have started to improve,” Beltran said, whose group is looking to buy luxury hotels with occupancy rates that exceed 65 percent. Property prices declined for a second straight year in 2012, losing 2.2 percent, according to Confidencial Imobiliario, a company that collects data on the Portuguese real estate market. For some assets, such as residential and retail space, prices will decline another 10 percent to 15 percent before recovering in early 2014, according to Beltran. Values since 2008, though, are little changed, down 1.6 percent, Confidencial Imobiliario figures show. Unlike in neighboring Spain, the market experienced no boom and bust, said Antonio Souto, a board member at Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) , Portugal’s biggest publicly traded bank. No Bubble “Portugal never had a real estate bubble, prices were always moderate,” said Souto. “Let’s say now there is a certain stabilization, but no improvement yet.” Portugal was the third euro member to seek an emergency bailout when it secured 78 billion euros in May 2011 following Greece and Ireland. The economy is in its third year of recession and unemployment is the highest since at least 1998. Less than 30 miles west of the Quinta do Lago, ghost resorts and half-finished apartments in the once-bustling tourist town of Albufeira illustrate Portugal’s recent past. At the 450 million-euro Herdade dos Salgados Resort , a sign on a fence blocking the entrance to the main hotel states that “the building company has exercised the right to retain this property.” Leaves wither on the palm trees that surround the two vacant hotels, apartments and empty swimming pools. It had opened a month before Portugal requested its bailout. White Elephants “Have you heard of a white elephant?” William Blair, a 60-year-old Canadian, asked as he walked with his wife near the beach alongside the Herdade dos Salgados on Feb. 18. “This is like looking at four white elephants.” At another complex in Albufeira, two stray dogs run around a half-empty swimming pool. The 96 units have remained unfilled since they were completed in 2008. “All these blocks have been empty for years,” said Oliver Michel, a security guard standing outside. “I’m here alone all day. It’s actually quite sad.” A few feet below, more than 50 unfinished red brick apartment buildings lead down to a half-empty marina. The site has been empty since the construction workers downed tools two years ago, said Jose Carlos Rolo , the president of Albufeira. He estimates more than 1 billion euros was lost on now-zombie real estate projects in Albufeira during the last three years. “Neither the politicians, nor the banks, nor the building companies foresaw such a crisis,” Rolo said on Feb. 18. ‘Lots of Cash’ As The Keys project, which is costing 230 million euros, moves toward completion by June, investors are also looking at the ghost resorts, betting that the tourism industry is in recovery. “The type of investors in the prime property market aren’t affected by the economic cycle,” Lenherr, 46, of E3, which also has operations in the Caribbean and Southern Europe, said on Feb. 25 “We’re talking about captains of industry, heads of banks and funds with lots of cash available.” The Herdade dos Salgados Resort is scheduled to reopen this year after ECS Capital, a Lisbon-based private equity fund, acquired its loans from Portuguese banks and took over management, said an ECS spokesman, who asked not to be identified, citing company policy. Banco Espirito Santo (BES) was among the banks that sold the loans to the ECS fund, said Souto, the board member. He declined to say how much debt from real estate developers the bank sold in the same manner. “This is an experience that’s working well,” he said. “Some of these companies would otherwise end up insolvent and thousands of jobs and value would be lost.” Hotel Factory The tourism and real estate market’s recovery is crucial for Portugal’s economy, which the government projects will return to growth next year, after shrinking an estimated 1 percent in 2013 and 3.2 percent in 2012. Tourism accounts for about 10 percent of the gross domestic product, compared with 17 percent in Greece. In the Algarve, about eight in 10 jobs are in the tourism industry. Unemployment in the region reached 17.9 percent last year, the highest level in all of Portugal. The number of hotels in Portugal almost doubled to 992 in the past decade, according to Portugal’s National Statistics Institute. The occupancy rate , the proportion of beds booked, fell to 41.3 percent in 2012 from 42.8 percent the previous year, according to data compiled by the Tourism Office. In 2002, the rate was 49.7 percent. “If the hotel business was a factory, more than 50 percent of its output wouldn’t make it out of the plant,” Frederico Costa, the head of Portugal’s Tourism Office, said in an interview on Feb. 14. “The problem with some of the existing hotels is that they simply had too much debt.” Room Bookings At the top end of the market in the Algarve, demand from customers is picking up, said Joachim Hartl, the director of the Conrad Algarve Hotel in Quinta do Lago that opened in September. The occupancy rate for five-star hotels in Portugal rose 2.7 percentage points in 2012 to 54.9 percent, while all other hotel categories saw occupancy rates decline, according to data compiled by the Tourism Office. The parking lot of the 200 million-euro Conrad, part of the Hilton chain owned by Blackstone Group LP (BX) , had a handful of Porsches, BMWs and Mercedes-Benz cars. Some belonged to second- home-owners in the Quinta do Lago spending time at the hotel’s Spa and Health Club or steak and seafood restaurant. Luxury Niche Guests at the 154-room hotel built in the form of an 18th century Portuguese palace pay as much as 4,000 euros a night to stay in the Rose Garden suite in the off-season, rising to about 4,450 euros later in the year, said Hartl. “Is the destination under a lot of price pressure? Yes it is,” Hartl said. “That’s why I believe there is even more of an opportunity to come up with a luxury property because there’s a niche for that and we’re really carving out a new market.” The Keys is firmly in that niche. Workers are completing the last set of houses with swimming pools alongside an artificial lake. A gardener waters the lawn of one of the 72 properties, which have names such as “The Bel Air” or “The Melrose.” The sales brochure says the development is taken from the “elegant modernism of Miami and the luster of Hollywood.” “Gone are the days of the buying and selling frenzy,” said Alison Buechner Hojbjerg, an agent at Quinta Properties who’s involved in selling villas at The Keys. “Buyers now are on the lookout for the best plots at the best prices.” To contact the reporter on this story: Henrique Almeida in Lisbon at halmeida5@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: Jerrold Colten at jcolten@bloomberg.net ; Rob Urban at robprag@bloomberg.net",['Henrique Almeida'],"Portugal’s $9 Million Villas Draw Investors to Crisis: Mortgages At “ The Keys ,” a cluster of luxury villas on the Atlantic coast modelled on Miami’s palm- tree resorts, builders and gardeners are busy trying to finish before the summer tourist season. The $300 million investment is on the other side of the ocean from Florida , at Quinta do Lago in the Algarve region of Portugal , a country more synonymous of late with economic collapse than new real-estate projects. The villas are on sale for as much as 7 million euros ($9 million) each and a quarter have buyers, according to the developer, U.K.-based E3 Property. “The recession was very strong, but based on our sales in Portugal, we now feel there’s a strengthening of the prime property market,” said Mark Lenherr, who runs the company. Sun, sand and golf have long attracted tourists to Portugal, with the Algarve accounting for one in three visitors. As property prices fall after the overbuilding of hotels and resorts that never filled up, investors are now picking over the debris from Europe ’s financial crisis, including funds acquiring soured commercial mortgages from banks and a Saudi sheikh returning to the market. While investment in Portuguese real estate is still down more than 50 percent from the 2007 peak, it rose 68 percent to 424.5 million euros in 2012, according to data compiled by realtor Cushman & Wakefield Inc. Three-quarters of the investment was in residential property, boosted by banks selling non-performing loans to funds, said Luis Rocha Antunes, the firm’s director of investment in Lisbon. Saudi Sheikh “While we remain cautious about the real estate market amid a weak economy in Portugal, we expect investment volumes to increase this year,” Antunes said. Saudi Sheikh Mohamed bin Issa al Jaber is looking at four- and five-star hotels in Portugal, he said while visiting the country this month. Al Jaber, Saudi Arabia ’s third-richest man based on data compiled by Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, may sell some budget hotels that are no longer part of the strategy of his company, JJW Hotels & Resorts Ltd. He declined to say which assets he may sell or buy. “Where there are difficulties there will always be opportunities,” Al Jaber said by telephone. MBI International & Partners Inc., the holding company founded by Al Jaber that controls JJW Hotels, bought three resorts in the Algarve in 2008 from Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT) for $268 million. In February, he repaid all his mortgage debt to Portuguese banks. Carlton Group Clients of the Carlton Group Inc., a U.S. real-estate investment bank, set aside 7.5 billion euros for purchases in Spain and Portugal over the next 12 to 18 months as the risk of a euro break-up diminishes and prices adjust to what buyers expect to pay, said Javier Beltran, who’s in charge of Carlton’s Iberian operation. “Since the beginning of this year, the prospects for Portugal’s real estate market have started to improve,” Beltran said, whose group is looking to buy luxury hotels with occupancy rates that exceed 65 percent. Property prices declined for a second straight year in 2012, losing 2.2 percent, according to Confidencial Imobiliario, a company that collects data on the Portuguese real estate market. For some assets, such as residential and retail space, prices will decline another 10 percent to 15 percent before recovering in early 2014, according to Beltran. Values since 2008, though, are little changed, down 1.6 percent, Confidencial Imobiliario figures show. Unlike in neighboring Spain, the market experienced no boom and bust, said Antonio Souto, a board member at Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) , Portugal’s biggest publicly traded bank. No Bubble “Portugal never had a real estate bubble, prices were always moderate,” said Souto. “Let’s say now there is a certain stabilization, but no improvement yet.” Portugal was the third euro member to seek an emergency bailout when it secured 78 billion euros in May 2011 following Greece and Ireland. The economy is in its third year of recession and unemployment is the highest since at least 1998. Less than 30 miles west of the Quinta do Lago, ghost resorts and half-finished apartments in the once-bustling tourist town of Albufeira illustrate Portugal’s recent past. At the 450 million-euro Herdade dos Salgados Resort , a sign on a fence blocking the entrance to the main hotel states that “the building company has exercised the right to retain this property.” Leaves wither on the palm trees that surround the two vacant hotels, apartments and empty swimming pools. It had opened a month before Portugal requested its bailout. White Elephants “Have you heard of a white elephant?” William Blair, a 60-year-old Canadian, asked as he walked with his wife near the beach alongside the Herdade dos Salgados on Feb. 18. “This is like looking at four white elephants.” At another complex in Albufeira, two stray dogs run around a half-empty swimming pool. The 96 units have remained unfilled since they were completed in 2008. “All these blocks have been empty for years,” said Oliver Michel, a security guard standing outside. “I’m here alone all day. It’s actually quite sad.” A few feet below, more than 50 unfinished red brick apartment buildings lead down to a half-empty marina. The site has been empty since the construction workers downed tools two years ago, said Jose Carlos Rolo , the president of Albufeira. He estimates more than 1 billion euros was lost on now-zombie real estate projects in Albufeira during the last three years. “Neither the politicians, nor the banks, nor the building companies foresaw such a crisis,” Rolo said on Feb. 18. ‘Lots of Cash’ As The Keys project, which is costing 230 million euros, moves toward completion by June, investors are also looking at the ghost resorts, betting that the tourism industry is in recovery. “The type of investors in the prime property market aren’t affected by the economic cycle,” Lenherr, 46, of E3, which also has operations in the Caribbean and Southern Europe, said on Feb. 25 “We’re talking about captains of industry, heads of banks and funds with lots of cash available.” The Herdade dos Salgados Resort is scheduled to reopen this year after ECS Capital, a Lisbon-based private equity fund, acquired its loans from Portuguese banks and took over management, said an ECS spokesman, who asked not to be identified, citing company policy. Banco Espirito Santo (BES) was among the banks that sold the loans to the ECS fund, said Souto, the board member. He declined to say how much debt from real estate developers the bank sold in the same manner. “This is an experience that’s working well,” he said. “Some of these companies would otherwise end up insolvent and thousands of jobs and value would be lost.” Hotel Factory The tourism and real estate market’s recovery is crucial for Portugal’s economy, which the government projects will return to growth next year, after shrinking an estimated 1 percent in 2013 and 3.2 percent in 2012. Tourism accounts for about 10 percent of the gross domestic product, compared with 17 percent in Greece. In the Algarve, about eight in 10 jobs are in the tourism industry. Unemployment in the region reached 17.9 percent last year, the highest level in all of Portugal. The number of hotels in Portugal almost doubled to 992 in the past decade, according to Portugal’s National Statistics Institute. The occupancy rate , the proportion of beds booked, fell to 41.3 percent in 2012 from 42.8 percent the previous year, according to data compiled by the Tourism Office. In 2002, the rate was 49.7 percent. “If the hotel business was a factory, more than 50 percent of its output wouldn’t make it out of the plant,” Frederico Costa, the head of Portugal’s Tourism Office, said in an interview on Feb. 14. “The problem with some of the existing hotels is that they simply had too much debt.” Room Bookings At the top end of the market in the Algarve, demand from customers is picking up, said Joachim Hartl, the director of the Conrad Algarve Hotel in Quinta do Lago that opened in September. The occupancy rate for five-star hotels in Portugal rose 2.7 percentage points in 2012 to 54.9 percent, while all other hotel categories saw occupancy rates decline, according to data compiled by the Tourism Office. The parking lot of the 200 million-euro Conrad, part of the Hilton chain owned by Blackstone Group LP (BX) , had a handful of Porsches, BMWs and Mercedes-Benz cars. Some belonged to second- home-owners in the Quinta do Lago spending time at the hotel’s Spa and Health Club or steak and seafood restaurant. Luxury Niche Guests at the 154-room hotel built in the form of an 18th century Portuguese palace pay as much as 4,000 euros a night to stay in the Rose Garden suite in the off-season, rising to about 4,450 euros later in the year, said Hartl. “Is the destination under a lot of price pressure?

India Said to Summon Italy Envoy to Protest Decision on Marines,['Lorenzo Totaro' 'Andrew Mac Askill'],2013-03-12 11:58:30,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/italian-marines-charged-with-killing-in-india-to-remain-in-italy.html,"India will summon the Italian ambassador to protest the decision by his government not to return two marines charged with killing Indian fishermen they suspected of being pirates in seas off Kerala state. The Ministry of External Affairs will ask envoy Daniele Mancini why the men will not be coming back to New Delhi to face trial, according to an Indian official, who asked not be named because he is not authorized to discuss the matter. In a petition to India’s Supreme Court, the Italian government had guaranteed that the men would return. The prosecution of the Italians was the first attempt to hold armed maritime guards accountable for the deaths of innocent people in an anti-piracy operation. Relations between the two countries were further strained by allegations that bribes were paid by a unit of Italy ’s Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) to secure the contract to supply 12 civilian helicopters to the Indian government. “They will never face justice now,” said John Churchill, a Catholic priest who is general secretary of the South Asian Fishermen Fraternity and a cousin of one of the dead fishermen. “It is an insult to all of India.” Opposition lawmakers disrupted India’s parliament to protest the Italian decision. Legislators in both chambers demanded to know what the Indian government would do to bring the men back after they returned home to vote in Italy’s elections. A person who answered the phone at the Italian embassy in New Delhi asked for all queries to be sent by e-mail. An e-mail sent seeking comment from Mancini was not immediately returned. ‘Conspiracy’ Mancini had informed the Indian authorities that Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone “won’t return to India,” the European nation’s Foreign Ministry said yesterday. The Italian government said India failed to respond to a request to negotiate a diplomatic solution. India’s government was informed of the Italian move late yesterday and will make no further comment until it has reviewed its position, said Syed Akbaruddin, a spokesman for the Ministry of External Affairs. The main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party accused the government of working with the Italian government to end the diplomatic standoff. “This is unacceptable and we will not allow the government to get away with this criminal conspiracy,” Tarun Vijay, a BJP lawmaker, told reporters. The marines were due to return to New Delhi to be tried for the killing of the two fisherman in waters off the southern state of Kerala in February 2012. The marines were acting as guards on the Italian-flagged Enrica Lexie tanker as it sailed to Egypt from Singapore , a route that includes crossing the Indian Ocean, where Somali pirates operate. Christmas Leave They were allowed to return to Italy for Christmas after the Italian ambassador gave a guarantee the men would be returned. Mancini gave the same guarantee that the men would return in petition to the Supreme Court. The arrest of the Italians triggered a diplomatic rift between Italy and India as they presented different versions of the attack. Italy has argued that the men shot the two fishermen in self-defense and that the marines should be tried in their own country because the incident occurred in international waters outside of India’s jurisdiction. Ferrari Protest Ferrari SpA, the Italian sports carmaker, even weighed in, having two of its cars carry the flag of the Italian navy during the Oct. 28 Formula One grand-prix race in New Delhi. India’s Chief Justice ruled in January that the two men could be put on trial in New Delhi, ordering hearings before a specially convened court in the capital. Separately, India’s government has ordered an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the alleged graft in the helicopter purchase and is threatening to cancel the deal if any wrongdoing is uncovered.

US Air CEO Defies Buffett Adage Seeing American on Top,['Mary Schlangenstein'],2013-03-11 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/us-air-ceo-defies-buffett-adage-seeing-american-on-top.html,"Doug Parker, returning to the carrier where he began his career, has a vision: He sees American Airlines (AAMRQ) vaulting to the top of the industry’s major financial benchmarks just three years after the merger he orchestrated with US Airways Group Inc. Don’t take his visions lightly. Parker was chief executive officer of the eighth-largest U.S. carrier and the youngest airline CEO in America when he began calling for consolidation in the U.S. Twelve years later, the industry is about to shrink to three airlines with international reach, and the 51-year-old US Airways CEO was central to making that happen. The man poised to run the new American as it becomes the world’s biggest airline is propelled by a mix of relentless determination, pragmatism, patience, risk, energy and a kind of Reaganesque confidence that tends to rub off on a room. Asked at an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York whether he has sometimes felt like actor-director Ben Affleck , who said at the Oscars that being knocked down is less important than getting up, Parker looked quizzical for a moment and responded, “I’ve never felt knocked down.” That’s quite a statement for someone who became CEO of already struggling America West Holdings Corp. 10 days before the 9/11 attacks; was caught up in airlines’ deepest cutbacks in flying since World War II; had his company dissed as “the ugly girl” amid three rebuffs by potential merger partners; and was elbowed away when he first suggested that US Airways take over bankrupt AMR Corp.’s much-bigger American. ‘Bad Business’ “From the time I started in this business, people would say, ‘It’s the airline business; it’s romantic and we don’t make money,’” Parker said. “But none of that ever made sense to me. It’s not romantic. It’s bad business.” Speaking quickly, in full sentences with few pauses, Parker gives the impression of someone who knows where a paragraph ends before he even starts, much as he says he always knew airlines would have to consolidate to survive. The son of a Kroger Co. meat cutter who rose to vice president, Parker received an MBA at Vanderbilt University and said he’s not an “airline geek” who “breathes jet fuel.” Instead, asked why he likes the job, he talked about the complexities, from finance to marketing to operations to maintenance. “I love the business,” he said. “The business we do is hard. I like the challenge of the business, the logistics. I like how everything is important in it.” Bearish Buffett The odds against Parker can’t be overstated. Warren Buffett likes to say that the airline industry , as a whole, hasn’t made a penny since the Wright Brothers flew at Kitty Hawk. The Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) chairman has sworn off airline investments since a 1989 investment in US Airways that he once dubbed a “mistake.” Parker will need to blend two airlines with almost 94,000 employees, more than 900 mainline jets, eight hubs and 99 million loyalty plan members. He also must build a common identity for employees, woo back corporate fliers lost to the wider networks of United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) , and repair operations that left American last among seven major U.S. carriers in on-time arrivals in 2012. “The execution of this has got to be close to perfect,” said George Hamlin, president of Hamlin Transportation Consulting in Fairfax, Virginia. “You have companies with different cultures, a lot of different systems. There’s an awful lot of moving parts. And one of the parties in this marriage has come somewhat unwillingly.” Profit Streak Some believe Parker can pull it off. Fourteen of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg recommend buying Tempe, Arizona-based US Airways, which has more than tripled since AMR’s bankruptcy filing on Nov. 29, 2011; one has a hold rating. Parker has led US Airways to annual profits since 2010 and will extend the streak this year and next on a stand-alone basis, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. By passenger traffic, the airline he runs now is only half as big as the one he is about to lead, and ranks fifth in the U.S. to American’s No. 3. “He’s clearly not afraid of risk or to take chances,” said Hunter Keay , an analyst with Wolfe Trahan & Co. in New York. “I don’t think Doug ever wants to look back and say, ‘I wish I had done that.’ He’s willing to embrace commercial risk so he can effect change, given his small size in the industry.” Parker’s first job out of college was in the financial planning department at Fort Worth , Texas-based American, working with a young man named Tom Horton. ‘Best Airline’ “I was there from ’86 to ’91,” said Parker, who started a year after Bob Crandall became American’s CEO and ushered in more than a decade of growth marked by new routes, planes and alliances. American employees believed then that they worked for “the best airline in the world,” Parker said. “They lost some of that.” Parker left American in 1991 to be Northwest Airlines Corp.’s vice president and assistant treasurer, and was hired as chief financial officer at America West in 1995, the year after the airline emerged from bankruptcy. In 2001, at age 39, Parker was named CEO of the carrier dubbed “America Worst” for its poor operations and service. Parker was among early proponents of consolidation as a way to bring much-needed stability to the industry, letting carriers focus on so-called fortress hubs instead of battling for market share everywhere. That could help produce profits, damp troughs in the business and allow airlines to stay profitable when fuel prices surge, he said. Sept. 11 He was barely into his tenure when he went before Congress seeking federal aid following the Sept. 11 attacks. Without help, he said, America West would be forced into bankruptcy within days. The airline and US Airways were the only two major carriers to receive loans backed by the U.S. government. From 2001 through 2004, Parker’s first four years as CEO at America West, operating losses bled $22.5 billion from U.S. airlines, U.S. statistics show. In Parker’s view, the 9/11 attacks didn’t cause industry consolidation -- the post-Sept. 11 travel slump only accelerated an inevitable shake-out for U.S. airlines saddled with unsustainable expenses and overseas networks inferior to foreign competitors. “Their costs were too high and they didn’t provide what business customers really wanted, which was to take them anywhere they wanted to go globally,” Parker said. “Those airlines had to get their costs down.” ‘Real Value’ In 2005, Parker secured about $1.57 billion from planemaker Airbus SAS, former Air Canada parent ACE Aviation Holdings Inc. and hedge funds Par Capital Management Inc. and Peninsula Investment Partners LP to acquire bankrupt US Airways, which was 60 percent larger than America West. It was an unprecedented group of investors for an airline takeover. “There’s real value in consolidation,” he said. “We took two airlines that probably wouldn’t have made it, and put them together to create an airline that’s making record profits.” Parker said he learned a critical lesson from that first merger: America West kept its processes and computer systems for the combined airline even though US Airways was larger, because he and his team felt those were better and certainly more familiar. That decision led to delays and long lines at some airports in 2007 when the carriers’ reservation systems were combined and some passengers couldn’t check in. Parker later realized that the bigger airline’s systems must subsume the smaller, an approach he says he will bring to the new deal. Adopt, Go “Management teams get wedded to their systems and processes,” he said. “We’ve stolen this from Delta: to ‘adopt and go.’ Just get yourself running by adopting the larger airline’s processes and just go. We need to get the integration done.” That includes labor unions. Under Parker, pilots from the old US Airways and America West failed to move to one labor contract, forcing them to operate with separate work rules and pay scales for more than seven years. Negotiations stopped when leaders for each union became embroiled in a legal battle over how to combine seniority lists. Parker maintained that he was ready to negotiate a combined accord once the two unions settled their dispute. Pilot unions at American and US Airways already have agreed on a transitional contract and a system to handle seniority integration. US Airways flight attendants didn’t approve their first joint contract since the America West merger until Feb. 28, after rejecting two prior accords. Going Hostile The US Airways deal didn’t sate Parker’s appetite for combinations. In late 2006, he made a hostile bid for Delta, an effort that collapsed two months later amid opposition from the Atlanta-based airline’s bankruptcy creditors and employees. Hours after US Airways admitted defeat and withdrew its Delta offer, Parker was arrested for drunken driving in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale. He had spent the evening at a party tent at a golf tournament , where he said he had consumed three beers. Parker later apologized for making such a mistake and for the “embarrassment” the incident caused US Airways. He pleaded guilty, paid a fine and was sentenced to one day in jail. The Delta failure taught another vital lesson, Parker said: move early on a takeover in bankruptcy and build support from workers and other groups first, because hostile moves rarely succeed. A little more than a year later, Delta acquired Northwest, which also had gone through bankruptcy. Industry Benefit “We were disappointed we didn’t end up with that transaction, but we were elated to see the results -- that the creditors put in place a board that was directed to go look at mergers and acquisitions, put in place a CEO who was directed to go look at mergers and consolidation,” he said. “Of all the things we’ve done to add value to our shareholders, the Delta hostile is certainly No. 2 or 3.” The Delta-Northwest deal stirred a flurry of merger talks around the industry in early 2008. Former United parent UAL Corp. considered a tie-up with US Airways, then walked away. In 2010, as US Airways and UAL prepared to announce a merger agreement -- a press release and a website for the combined company had already been prepared -- Continental Airlines Inc. CEO Jeff Smisek swooped in and engineered a deal with his counterpart at United, Glenn Tilton. “I didn’t want him to marry the ugly girl,” Smisek said as he and Tilton announced the creation of United Continental Holdings. ‘Odd Moment’ Parker got another chance for consolidation when American sought court protection in 2011. On the day American announced the move, his colleague from the old days, Tom Horton, became CEO and they talked on the phone. “It was a bit of an odd moment,” Parker recalled. “He filed and was named CEO the same day, so it was ‘Congratulations and I’m sorry you’re in bankruptcy.’” Parker said he believes that even in that first call, he broached the idea of a merger. Horton turned down Parker’s suggestions to begin talks, saying he wanted American to exit Chapter 11 on a stand-alone basis and then consider possible combinations. “In the early days of the restructuring , merger talk was premature,” Horton said. “It was essential to first complete the substance of the restructuring to create value for American. This allowed the merger to be negotiated from a position of much greater strength.” Move Fast Parker said he remembered his lessons from the aborted Delta merger: Work with investors and employees first and move fast. “We knew we couldn’t wait,” he said. “We knew we had to get something done early, before the deal got baked.” Parker and US Airways President Scott Kirby began detailing their plan and its benefits to AMR creditors and bondholders. In April, after a series of secret talks, they secured the backing of unions representing American’s pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and baggage handlers and signed them to contracts conditioned upon a merger. The unions had negotiated as much as six years with American before the bankruptcy without reaching new labor agreements. Parker knew the unions had expressed a lack of confidence in Horton and his management team and might be open to a deal. He also knew that pursuing a merger with labor’s blessing could be a game-changer. ‘Strategic Move’ “That was a brilliant strategic move,” said Jim Corridore , an analyst with S&P Capital IQ in New York. “He was able to make sure he got respect at the bargaining table from AMR and other stakeholders because of the way he got the unions on board.” US Airways used the growing base of support to help win over members of American’s creditors committee, which has a voice in major decisions made during bankruptcy and helped persuade AMR and its board to accept the merger. Still, considering the last-minute rejections of the past and American’s early resistance, Parker said he wasn’t sure the merger would occur until the day AMR’s board approved it, “or maybe the day before.” That vote came Feb. 13, and he found himself in Fort Worth, alongside Horton, to announce the tie-up the next morning: Valentine’s Day. Now Parker has to persuade regulators to approve the deal. Some consumer advocates are concerned that less competition will mean higher ticket prices, an issue already raised in congressional hearings. US Airways has said it expects the merger to close in the third quarter. Big Three American Airlines Group Inc., as the new company will be called, will join United and Delta as the only U.S. carriers with full-service cabins and international networks, down from seven airlines in 2000. They’re joined at the top of the industry by one dominant discounter, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) -- a realization of Parker’s consolidation goal. One of his sounding boards has been the man linked with the expansion of the old American: Crandall, 77, who retired as CEO and chairman in 1998. “I think the world of Bob Crandall. I have turned to him for advice a number of times throughout my career and through this process,” said Parker, who declined to talk about what the two have discussed. Crandall praised Parker and his team for doing a “superior job” in improving operations at US Airways. “Doug’s been pursuing the notion of enlarging US Airways for a long time,” said Crandall, who also wouldn’t comment on any conversations with Parker. “For this deal, he is in the right place at the right time, and they put the story together in a very persuasive way.” Industry Benchmarks Success for the merger will be based on the new American’s profitability relative to its peers, profit margins as good as or better than others in the U.S. industry, a return on capital and a return on equity to shareholders, Parker said. He will be “disappointed” if the airline isn’t leading its largest competitors on those metrics within three years, he said. “It’s a much more healthy industry structurally,” Parker said. “We now have an industry that’s positioned, at least, to be able to provide real returns to investors like they’ve never seen before.” Has Parker always been such an optimist?

Don’t take his visions lightly. Parker was chief executive officer of the eighth-largest U.S. carrier and the youngest airline CEO in America when he began calling for consolidation in the U.S. Twelve years later, the industry is about to shrink to three airlines with international reach, and the 51-year-old US Airways CEO was central to making that happen. The man poised to run the new American as it becomes the world’s biggest airline is propelled by a mix of relentless determination, pragmatism, patience, risk, energy and a kind of Reaganesque confidence that tends to rub off on a room. Asked at an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York whether he has sometimes felt like actor-director Ben Affleck , who said at the Oscars that being knocked down is less important than getting up, Parker looked quizzical for a moment and responded, “I’ve never felt knocked down.” That’s quite a statement for someone who became CEO of already struggling America West Holdings Corp. 10 days before the 9/11 attacks; was caught up in airlines’ deepest cutbacks in flying since World War II; had his company dissed as “the ugly girl” amid three rebuffs by potential merger partners; and was elbowed away when he first suggested that US Airways take over bankrupt AMR Corp.’s much-bigger American. ‘Bad Business’ “From the time I started in this business, people would say, ‘It’s the airline business; it’s romantic and we don’t make money,’” Parker said. “But none of that ever made sense to me. It’s not romantic. It’s bad business.” Speaking quickly, in full sentences with few pauses, Parker gives the impression of someone who knows where a paragraph ends before he even starts, much as he says he always knew airlines would have to consolidate to survive. The son of a Kroger Co. meat cutter who rose to vice president, Parker received an MBA at Vanderbilt University and said he’s not an “airline geek” who “breathes jet fuel.” Instead, asked why he likes the job, he talked about the complexities, from finance to marketing to operations to maintenance. “I love the business,” he said. “The business we do is hard. I like the challenge of the business, the logistics. I like how everything is important in it.” Bearish Buffett The odds against Parker can’t be overstated. Warren Buffett likes to say that the airline industry , as a whole, hasn’t made a penny since the Wright Brothers flew at Kitty Hawk. The Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) chairman has sworn off airline investments since a 1989 investment in US Airways that he once dubbed a “mistake.” Parker will need to blend two airlines with almost 94,000 employees, more than 900 mainline jets, eight hubs and 99 million loyalty plan members. He also must build a common identity for employees, woo back corporate fliers lost to the wider networks of United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) , and repair operations that left American last among seven major U.S. carriers in on-time arrivals in 2012. “The execution of this has got to be close to perfect,” said George Hamlin, president of Hamlin Transportation Consulting in Fairfax, Virginia. “You have companies with different cultures, a lot of different systems. There’s an awful lot of moving parts. And one of the parties in this marriage has come somewhat unwillingly.” Profit Streak Some believe Parker can pull it off. Fourteen of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg recommend buying Tempe, Arizona-based US Airways, which has more than tripled since AMR’s bankruptcy filing on Nov. 29, 2011; one has a hold rating. Parker has led US Airways to annual profits since 2010 and will extend the streak this year and next on a stand-alone basis, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. By passenger traffic, the airline he runs now is only half as big as the one he is about to lead, and ranks fifth in the U.S. to American’s No. 3. “He’s clearly not afraid of risk or to take chances,” said Hunter Keay , an analyst with Wolfe Trahan & Co. in New York. “I don’t think Doug ever wants to look back and say, ‘I wish I had done that.’ He’s willing to embrace commercial risk so he can effect change, given his small size in the industry.” Parker’s first job out of college was in the financial planning department at Fort Worth , Texas-based American, working with a young man named Tom Horton. ‘Best Airline’ “I was there from ’86 to ’91,” said Parker, who started a year after Bob Crandall became American’s CEO and ushered in more than a decade of growth marked by new routes, planes and alliances. American employees believed then that they worked for “the best airline in the world,” Parker said. “They lost some of that.” Parker left American in 1991 to be Northwest Airlines Corp.’s vice president and assistant treasurer, and was hired as chief financial officer at America West in 1995, the year after the airline emerged from bankruptcy. In 2001, at age 39, Parker was named CEO of the carrier dubbed “America Worst” for its poor operations and service. Parker was among early proponents of consolidation as a way to bring much-needed stability to the industry, letting carriers focus on so-called fortress hubs instead of battling for market share everywhere. That could help produce profits, damp troughs in the business and allow airlines to stay profitable when fuel prices surge, he said. Sept. 11 He was barely into his tenure when he went before Congress seeking federal aid following the Sept. 11 attacks. Without help, he said, America West would be forced into bankruptcy within days. The airline and US Airways were the only two major carriers to receive loans backed by the U.S. government. From 2001 through 2004, Parker’s first four years as CEO at America West, operating losses bled $22.5 billion from U.S. airlines, U.S. statistics show. In Parker’s view, the 9/11 attacks didn’t cause industry consolidation -- the post-Sept. 11 travel slump only accelerated an inevitable shake-out for U.S. airlines saddled with unsustainable expenses and overseas networks inferior to foreign competitors. “Their costs were too high and they didn’t provide what business customers really wanted, which was to take them anywhere they wanted to go globally,” Parker said. “Those airlines had to get their costs down.” ‘Real Value’ In 2005, Parker secured about $1.57 billion from planemaker Airbus SAS, former Air Canada parent ACE Aviation Holdings Inc. and hedge funds Par Capital Management Inc. and Peninsula Investment Partners LP to acquire bankrupt US Airways, which was 60 percent larger than America West. It was an unprecedented group of investors for an airline takeover. “There’s real value in consolidation,” he said. “We took two airlines that probably wouldn’t have made it, and put them together to create an airline that’s making record profits.” Parker said he learned a critical lesson from that first merger: America West kept its processes and computer systems for the combined airline even though US Airways was larger, because he and his team felt those were better and certainly more familiar. That decision led to delays and long lines at some airports in 2007 when the carriers’ reservation systems were combined and some passengers couldn’t check in. Parker later realized that the bigger airline’s systems must subsume the smaller, an approach he says he will bring to the new deal. Adopt, Go “Management teams get wedded to their systems and processes,” he said. “We’ve stolen this from Delta: to ‘adopt and go.’ Just get yourself running by adopting the larger airline’s processes and just go. We need to get the integration done.” That includes labor unions. Under Parker, pilots from the old US Airways and America West failed to move to one labor contract, forcing them to operate with separate work rules and pay scales for more than seven years. Negotiations stopped when leaders for each union became embroiled in a legal battle over how to combine seniority lists. Parker maintained that he was ready to negotiate a combined accord once the two unions settled their dispute. Pilot unions at American and US Airways already have agreed on a transitional contract and a system to handle seniority integration. US Airways flight attendants didn’t approve their first joint contract since the America West merger until Feb. 28, after rejecting two prior accords. Going Hostile The US Airways deal didn’t sate Parker’s appetite for combinations. In late 2006, he made a hostile bid for Delta, an effort that collapsed two months later amid opposition from the Atlanta-based airline’s bankruptcy creditors and employees. Hours after US Airways admitted defeat and withdrew its Delta offer, Parker was arrested for drunken driving in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale. He had spent the evening at a party tent at a golf tournament , where he said he had consumed three beers. Parker later apologized for making such a mistake and for the “embarrassment” the incident caused US Airways. He pleaded guilty, paid a fine and was sentenced to one day in jail. The Delta failure taught another vital lesson, Parker said: move early on a takeover in bankruptcy and build support from workers and other groups first, because hostile moves rarely succeed. A little more than a year later, Delta acquired Northwest, which also had gone through bankruptcy. Industry Benefit “We were disappointed we didn’t end up with that transaction, but we were elated to see the results -- that the creditors put in place a board that was directed to go look at mergers and acquisitions, put in place a CEO who was directed to go look at mergers and consolidation,” he said. “Of all the things we’ve done to add value to our shareholders, the Delta hostile is certainly No. 2 or 3.” The Delta-Northwest deal stirred a flurry of merger talks around the industry in early 2008. Former United parent UAL Corp. considered a tie-up with US Airways, then walked away. In 2010, as US Airways and UAL prepared to announce a merger agreement -- a press release and a website for the combined company had already been prepared -- Continental Airlines Inc. CEO Jeff Smisek swooped in and engineered a deal with his counterpart at United, Glenn Tilton. “I didn’t want him to marry the ugly girl,” Smisek said as he and Tilton announced the creation of United Continental Holdings. ‘Odd Moment’ Parker got another chance for consolidation when American sought court protection in 2011. On the day American announced the move, his colleague from the old days, Tom Horton, became CEO and they talked on the phone. “It was a bit of an odd moment,” Parker recalled. “He filed and was named CEO the same day, so it was ‘Congratulations and I’m sorry you’re in bankruptcy.’” Parker said he believes that even in that first call, he broached the idea of a merger. Horton turned down Parker’s suggestions to begin talks, saying he wanted American to exit Chapter 11 on a stand-alone basis and then consider possible combinations. “In the early days of the restructuring , merger talk was premature,” Horton said. “It was essential to first complete the substance of the restructuring to create value for American. This allowed the merger to be negotiated from a position of much greater strength.” Move Fast Parker said he remembered his lessons from the aborted Delta merger: Work with investors and employees first and move fast. “We knew we couldn’t wait,” he said. “We knew we had to get something done early, before the deal got baked.” Parker and US Airways President Scott Kirby began detailing their plan and its benefits to AMR creditors and bondholders. In April, after a series of secret talks, they secured the backing of unions representing American’s pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and baggage handlers and signed them to contracts conditioned upon a merger. The unions had negotiated as much as six years with American before the bankruptcy without reaching new labor agreements. Parker knew the unions had expressed a lack of confidence in Horton and his management team and might be open to a deal. He also knew that pursuing a merger with labor’s blessing could be a game-changer. ‘Strategic Move’ “That was a brilliant strategic move,” said Jim Corridore , an analyst with S&P Capital IQ in New York. “He was able to make sure he got respect at the bargaining table from AMR and other stakeholders because of the way he got the unions on board.” US Airways used the growing base of support to help win over members of American’s creditors committee, which has a voice in major decisions made during bankruptcy and helped persuade AMR and its board to accept the merger. Still, considering the last-minute rejections of the past and American’s early resistance, Parker said he wasn’t sure the merger would occur until the day AMR’s board approved it, “or maybe the day before.” That vote came Feb. 13, and he found himself in Fort Worth, alongside Horton, to announce the tie-up the next morning: Valentine’s Day. Now Parker has to persuade regulators to approve the deal. Some consumer advocates are concerned that less competition will mean higher ticket prices, an issue already raised in congressional hearings. US Airways has said it expects the merger to close in the third quarter. Big Three American Airlines Group Inc., as the new company will be called, will join United and Delta as the only U.S. carriers with full-service cabins and international networks, down from seven airlines in 2000. They’re joined at the top of the industry by one dominant discounter, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) -- a realization of Parker’s consolidation goal. One of his sounding boards has been the man linked with the expansion of the old American: Crandall, 77, who retired as CEO and chairman in 1998. “I think the world of Bob Crandall. I have turned to him for advice a number of times throughout my career and through this process,” said Parker, who declined to talk about what the two have discussed. Crandall praised Parker and his team for doing a “superior job” in improving operations at US Airways. “Doug’s been pursuing the notion of enlarging US Airways for a long time,” said Crandall, who also wouldn’t comment on any conversations with Parker. “For this deal, he is in the right place at the right time, and they put the story together in a very persuasive way.” Industry Benchmarks Success for the merger will be based on the new American’s profitability relative to its peers, profit margins as good as or better than others in the U.S. industry, a return on capital and a return on equity to shareholders, Parker said. He will be “disappointed” if the airline isn’t leading its largest competitors on those metrics within three years, he said. “It’s a much more healthy industry structurally,” Parker said. “We now have an industry that’s positioned, at least, to be able to provide real returns to investors like they’ve never seen before.” Has Parker always been such an optimist? He smiled at the question and responded, in one of those full paragraphs: “I believe it, so it’s easy. This is a great business that has a really nice future ahead of it, and we have a very good airline that we’re going to build. I’m excited about it. None of this is surprising to me.

State Troopers Lose Jobs Over 2012 Sports Car Death Race,['Erik Larson'],2013-03-11 20:21:48,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/new-jersey-state-troopers-forfeit-jobs-over-2012-death-race-.html,"A New Jersey State Police sergeant who escorted a high-speed caravan of Lamborghinis, Ferraris and other sports cars to Atlantic City pleaded guilty to altering the license plates of his troop vehicle to avoid detection. Nadir Nassry, 47, agreed to forfeit his job, as did a second trooper, 29-year-old Joseph Ventrella, who had joined the unauthorized escort at Nassry’s request, New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey S. Chiesa said today in an e-mailed statement. Prosecutors will recommend Nassry receive a probationary term at his sentencing hearing scheduled for April 29, Chiesa said. “These troopers violated” policing standards “and betrayed the public’s trust, undermining public safety and the reputation of the force,” Chiesa said in the statement. “They are justly paying a high price for their poor judgment.” Motorists reported two state-police cruisers on March 30, 2012, leading a group of more than 20 cars in a “Death Race” convoy at speeds of 100 miles (160 kilometers) an hour toward Atlantic City, according to complaints filed with the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. The convoy, which also included several Porsches, started in Fort Lee , New Jersey, across the Hudson River from the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan ; it finished about 133 miles away at the end of the Atlantic City Expressway, near the Trump Taj Mahal casino, according to the attorney general’s office. Records Tampering Nassry, a police officer for 26 years, entered the plea today before Superior Court Judge Bradley Ferencz in Middlesex County. Ventrella, who didn’t plead guilty, agreed to waive indictment and be charged “by accusation” with fourth-degree falsifying or tampering with records, Chiesa said today. “Sergeant Nassry apologizes to motorists endangered on that day” and to Ventrella, “whose career was lost as a result of this one-time act of stupidity,” Nassry’s lawyer, Charles Sciarra, said in an e-mailed statement. While some motorists characterized the high-speed convoy as a “Death Race,” the vehicles weren’t racing each other and no one was killed in the incident. Sciarra said in July 2012 that Nassry led the caravan at the request of Brandon Jacobs , who was a player on the National Football League ’s San Francisco 49ers. Chiesa said at the time that neither Jacobs nor any other drivers escorted by troopers would face criminal charges. A New Jersey pension board must decide whether Nassry will keep his pension, because the crime to which he pleaded guilty isn’t among the offenses that result in automatic forfeiture, said Peter Aseltine, a spokesman for the attorney general, today in a phone interview.

Mexico Peso Reaches Strongest Since August 2011 as U.S. Jobs Lag,['Ben Bain'],2013-04-06 01:06:24,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-06/mexico-peso-reaches-strongest-since-august-2011-as-u-s-jobs-lag.html,"Mexico ’s peso reached its strongest level since August 2011 as sputtering U.S. job creation boosted speculation that the Federal Reserve will maintain its record stimulus. The currency jumped 1.1 percent, the biggest daily advance since Jan. 2, to 12.1752 per U.S. dollar at 3 p.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s increased 1.3 percent against the dollar on the week, fueling a 5.6 percent advance this year, which is the biggest rally against the dollar’s 16 most-traded counterparts. Payrolls in the U.S., Mexico’s biggest trading partner, posted the smallest gain in nine months in March, Labor Department data showed today in Washington. Fed officials have have said they are waiting for sustained signs of job-market resilience before winding down their $85 billion of monthly bond purchases. The U.S. jobs data spurred investor speculation that the Fed will continue the so-called quantitative easing, or QE, according to Mike Moran, a senior currency strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in New York. “After the number that we say today you can pretty much kiss goodbye the possibility of the Fed reducing the speed of QE anytime soon,” Alberto Bernal the head of fixed-income research at Miami-based brokerage Bulltick Capital Markets. “One of the best ways of playing quantitative easing is to be long the peso.” The payrolls grew by 88,000 in March, less than the most- pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey, after a revised 268,000 February increase. The jobless rate fell to 7.6 percent from 7.7 percent. Carstens Comments Central bank Governor Agustin Carstens said today at an event in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico that the peso is a reflection of the nation’s economic strength. “To the extent that we have a strong economy, we’re going to have a strong currency,” he said. “This is a good combination of factors.” The difference between the number of wagers by hedge funds and other large speculators on a peso advance versus those on a drop -- so-called net longs -- was 142,755 on April 2, compared with 128,162 a week earlier, according to data compiled by the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Latin America’s second-biggest economy is expected to grow faster than Brazil for a third-straight year in 2013, according to the median forecast of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

Small Caps Rule Bovespa as Stimulus Skips Vale: Corporate Brazil,['Marisa Castellani' 'Josue Leonel' 'Ney Hayashi'],2012-09-21 14:01:53,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/small-caps-rule-bovespa-as-stimulus-skips-vale-corporate-brazil.html,"Brazilian small-cap shares are surging to their most expensive level in three years relative to the Bovespa index as government stimulus sparks rallies in stocks from education company Anhanguera Educacional Participacoes SA (AEDU3) to bus maker Marcopolo SA. (POMO4)  The BM&FBovespa Small Cap (SMLLBV) index rose 23 percent this year, more than twice the main stock measure’s 8.9 percent gain. The rally helped push shares in the index to 1.59 times their book value this month, up from a three-year low of 1.33 in June and the highest compared with the Bovespa since February 2009. The index contains stocks with a combined market value of less than 15 percent of the total market capitalization of all publicly traded Brazilian companies. Government stimulus from tax cuts on appliances to increased infrastructure investment is fueling a recovery that is benefiting small-cap companies more than their larger peers. Consumer stocks account for 30 percent of the small-cap index, almost three times as much as their share of the Bovespa. Commodities producers, which are being hurt by slowing demand from China , account for 43 percent of the benchmark’s weighting. “We look at the domestic market as the main factor to allocate our resources,” said Herculano Alves, the head of equities at BRAM Bradesco Asset Management, which manages 279 billion reais ($137.8 billion) in Sao Paulo , including small-cap stocks such as Marcopolo and Anhanguera. “The economy isn’t growing overseas, and here we have growth in credit and wages.” Top Performer Minerva SA, Brazil ’s third-largest beef producer, was the best performer among the small-cap gauge’s 71 members this year, jumping 116 percent. Marcopolo has added 70 percent, and Anhanguera rallied 62 percent. Brazil’s economy in July expanded at the fastest pace in almost a year, the central bank said. The economic activity index, a proxy for gross domestic product, rose 2.34 percent from a year earlier after rising 0.99 percent in June, according to data released on Sept. 14. The forecast was for a 2.1 percent expansion, according to the median estimate of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Anhanguera’s competitor, Kroton Educacional SA (KROT3) , has jumped 89 percent this year. Education companies are benefiting from the government’s decision to expand the student-loan program known as FIES, which gives graduates as many as three times the number of years taken to get a college degree to pay the debt, said Alves. ‘Good Expectations’ In addition to recent acquisitions made by the company, “there are good expectations in general for the educational sector, which is helping the perception of the company’s stock,” Kroton Investor Relations Director Carlos Lazar said in an e-mailed statement. Anhanguera declined to comment. While small caps rally, gains among stocks with the heaviest weightings on the Bovespa, such as oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) and iron-ore producer Vale SA (VALE3) , are being limited by the slowdown in China, Brazil’s top trading partner, which pushed commodities lower, said Pedro Galdi , head strategist at SLW Corretora. Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-run oil company is known, has added 7 percent this year. The producer in the second quarter reported its first loss in 13 years. Vale, the world’s largest iron-ore miner, has declined 0.7 percent. Both companies are based in Rio de Janeiro. Vale’s press office declined to comment. Cars, Buses, Trucks Caxias do Sul, Brazil-based Marcopolo has benefited as the government steps up purchases of vehicles and cuts payroll taxes to bolster the recovery in Latin America ’s largest economy, Carlos Zignani, director of institutional relations at Marcopolo, said in an interview. Brazil added 6.6 billion reais to money set aside this year to purchase buses, tractors, trucks and other equipment, Finance Minister Guido Mantega said in June. “Small-cap stocks have benefited from Brazil’s plans to increase investments in infrastructure, boosting companies that operate with ports, railroads and logistics,” Galdi said by phone from Sao Paulo. The government’s policy to boost Brazil’s domestic market should keep pushing small-cap stocks higher, even now that the Bovespa index trades at cheaper valuations, Bradesco’s Alves said. “If we think Brazil will grow 3.5 percent to 4 percent in 2013, those companies should continue to do well,” Alves said. “What’s the better option, to put money in fixed income, with interest rates falling, or to invest in a company that’s expanding?” Still Cheap While the small-cap index is expensive when compared with the Bovespa, the Brazilian gauge for companies with lower market capitalization is still cheap when compared with similar measures in the U.S. and Europe , Alves said. Stocks in Brazil’s small-cap index trade at an average of 20.8 times analysts earnings’ estimates for this year, compared with a ratio of 24.9 for the S&P 600 Small Cap (SML) index in the U.S. and 29.4 for the FTSE Small Cap (SMX) index in the U.K. The Bovespa trades at a ratio of 20.5 times its earnings estimates and 1.25 its book value, a measure of a company’s net worth calculated by taking the value of assets and subtracting the value of liabilities. ‘More Risky’ The small-cap index will outperform the Bovespa for the next three years, as the outlook for the Brazil’s growth improves while the global economy struggles to rebound, said Roberta Kosaka, who manages small-cap funds at Banco Itau BBA SA. “If we look at the Brazilian economy, things have improved a lot in the past 10 years,” Kosaka said by phone from Sao Paulo. “The outlook for Brazil in the next three years is positive, while for the world, if it’s not catastrophic, it’s more risky.” To contact the reporters on this story: Marisa Castellani in Sao Paulo at  mcastellani7@bloomberg.net ; Josue Leonel in Sao Paulo at  jleonel@bloomberg.net ; Ney Hayashi in Sao Paulo at  ncruz4@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Walsh at  bwalsh8@bloomberg.net ; Jessica Brice at  jbrice1@bloomberg.net",['Marisa CastellaniJosue LeonelNey Hayashi'],"Small Caps Rule Bovespa as Stimulus Skips Vale: Corporate Brazil Brazilian small-cap shares are surging to their most expensive level in three years relative to the Bovespa index as government stimulus sparks rallies in stocks from education company Anhanguera Educacional Participacoes SA (AEDU3) to bus maker Marcopolo SA.

Tesla’s Musk Sidesteps 2012 Model S Sales Target,['Alan Ohnsman' 'Betty Liu'],2012-09-22 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/tesla-s-musk-sidesteps-2012-model-s-goal-sees-20-000-in-2013.html,"Elon Musk, co-founder and chief executive officer of Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , declined to confirm that the electric-car maker will be able to meet its initial delivery target for Model S sedans this year. Tesla, which began building the luxury cars in June in Fremont, California , will deliver 20,000 of the sedans next year and achieve a gross margin of more than 20 percent, Musk said yesterday in a Bloomberg Television interview on “In the Loop with Betty Liu .” The company in July said it was confident of delivering 5,000 Model S cars this year. Musk wouldn’t comment on that goal yesterday, saying that “I need to be very hesitant about talking about any near-term metrics for Tesla.” The carmaker, which counts Daimler AG (DAI) and Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) as customers and investors, has set a goal of becoming profitable by as early as next year from sales the $57,400 Model S and Model X sport-utility vehicle due in late 2013. Tesla is trying to balance investor demands to expand its business as quickly as possible while also avoiding quality problems and delays that have hit rechargeable vehicle competitors including Fisker Automotive Inc. “Should the company not meet the 5,000-unit goal, that will have some negative impact on revenue in the fourth quarter,” said Alan Baum, principal of auto-industry forecaster Baum & Associates in West Bloomfield, Michigan. That may not be an immediate concern for Tesla’s customers, he said. Tesla ‘Supporters’ “People that are buying this vehicle now are supporters of the company, so to some extent whether the volume is 5,000 or 4,000 or even 3,000 this year, it doesn’t really matter,” Baum said yesterday. “In the longer term, it’s more important that the product be thought of positively. The last thing the company needs is to disappoint buyers. They haven’t yet and they don’t intend to.” Along with starting production ahead of schedule in June, and producing at least 20,000 vehicles next year, the South African-born Musk said he’s confident of Tesla’s future profitability. “The third thing is that we would achieve a gross margin in excess of 25 percent,” he said. “Of those three things, I stand by those.” Since June, there have been “no recalls, no fires, no anything” in terms of assembly problems, Musk said. “First impressions matter.” U.S. Loans Fisker, a maker of luxury plug-in hybrid cars backed by U.S. government loans, said last month it planned to recall all of its $103,000 Karma sedans to fix a flawed cooling fan linked to a California fire. Fisker’s battery supplier, A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) , recalled flawed packs in March. Tesla has said has said it plans to begin repaying the Energy Department loan it received in 2009 late this year. The company, which sold shares to public for the first time in 2010, continues to study additional fundraising steps including a secondary share offering, Musk said yesterday, without elaborating. Musk also declined to elaborate on the current production pace at Palo Alto , California-based Tesla’s factory. Musk, 41, said in a Twitter post on Sept. 16 that the rate had risen to 100 vehicles a week. “Demand is not a problem for Tesla,” he said. “Probably the biggest reason people don’t put down a reservation for our cars is they have to wait too long to get it.” Separately, Tesla said yesterday in a statement on its website that it’s adding 10 more stores this year, including one that was scheduled to open yesterday at the Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City , New York. The new stores will give Tesla 24 North American outlets and 34 worldwide, the company said. The company is scheduled to unveil its “supercharger” system on Sept. 24 at its design studio in Hawthorne, California. Tesla fell 2.8 percent to $30.02 at the close yesterday in New York. The shares have gained 5.1 percent this year.

Tesla is trying to balance investor demands to expand its business as quickly as possible while also avoiding quality problems and delays that have hit rechargeable vehicle competitors including Fisker Automotive Inc. “Should the company not meet the 5,000-unit goal, that will have some negative impact on revenue in the fourth quarter,” said Alan Baum, principal of auto-industry forecaster Baum & Associates in West Bloomfield, Michigan. That may not be an immediate concern for Tesla’s customers, he said. Tesla ‘Supporters’ “People that are buying this vehicle now are supporters of the company, so to some extent whether the volume is 5,000 or 4,000 or even 3,000 this year, it doesn’t really matter,” Baum said yesterday. “In the longer term, it’s more important that the product be thought of positively. The last thing the company needs is to disappoint buyers. They haven’t yet and they don’t intend to.” Along with starting production ahead of schedule in June, and producing at least 20,000 vehicles next year, the South African-born Musk said he’s confident of Tesla’s future profitability. “The third thing is that we would achieve a gross margin in excess of 25 percent,” he said. “Of those three things, I stand by those.” Since June, there have been “no recalls, no fires, no anything” in terms of assembly problems, Musk said. “First impressions matter.” U.S. Loans Fisker, a maker of luxury plug-in hybrid cars backed by U.S. government loans, said last month it planned to recall all of its $103,000 Karma sedans to fix a flawed cooling fan linked to a California fire. Fisker’s battery supplier, A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) , recalled flawed packs in March. Tesla has said has said it plans to begin repaying the Energy Department loan it received in 2009 late this year. The company, which sold shares to public for the first time in 2010, continues to study additional fundraising steps including a secondary share offering, Musk said yesterday, without elaborating. Musk also declined to elaborate on the current production pace at Palo Alto , California-based Tesla’s factory. Musk, 41, said in a Twitter post on Sept. 16 that the rate had risen to 100 vehicles a week. “Demand is not a problem for Tesla,” he said. “Probably the biggest reason people don’t put down a reservation for our cars is they have to wait too long to get it.” Separately, Tesla said yesterday in a statement on its website that it’s adding 10 more stores this year, including one that was scheduled to open yesterday at the Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City , New York. The new stores will give Tesla 24 North American outlets and 34 worldwide, the company said. The company is scheduled to unveil its “supercharger” system on Sept. 24 at its design studio in Hawthorne, California. Tesla fell 2.8 percent to $30.02 at the close yesterday in New York. The shares have gained 5.1 percent this year.

Honda to Double Auto Sales Over 5 Years Led by Small Cars,['Anna Mukai' 'Yuki Hagiwara' 'Ma Jie'],2012-09-21 06:17:40,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/honda-plans-to-double-auto-sales-over-5-years-led-by-small-cars.html,"Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan ’s third- biggest carmaker, plans to double sales in five years, driven by demand for small cars such as the Fit compact and new models in emerging markets including China and India. Honda is targeting to sell 6 million vehicles annually by March 2017, up from 3.1 million last fiscal year, President Takanobu Ito said today. The maker of the Accord sedan will introduce 10 new and refreshed models in China by 2016, and a diesel car in India in the year ending March 2014, he said. “To reach sales of 6 million units, our Fit compact will be very important and be the leader in volume sales,” Ito said at a briefing at the Tokyo-based automaker’s headquarters. “In terms of volume sales, our Brio compact, which we expect to expand sales of in emerging markets, will be the next biggest.” Honda, recovering from last year’s natural disasters that hobbled supply chains in Japan and Thailand , is banking on a broadened lineup to bolster sales in emerging markets. The company is also counting on lower priced compact models such as the Fit to support sales in Japan as government subsidies come to an end. “The target seems feasible, and looks like a target that will match global growth,” Satoru Takada , a Tokyo-based auto analyst at Toward the Infinite World Inc., a securities research company, said by telephone. “It also shows that small vehicles will be Honda’s focus.” Worldwide Sales Global sales of passenger vehicles, excluding trucks and buses, will climb to 100.3 million units in 2017, a 27 percent increase from this year, according to estimates by industry researcher IHS Automotive. Honda fell 0.4 percent to 2,612 yen as of 2:33 p.m. in Tokyo trading, compared with the 0.7 percent gain for Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average. Honda will build the new Fit, its best seller in Japan this year, and another compact model at a Mexico factory slated to open in the spring of 2014, Ito said. The company will introduce a new sports car in Japan in 2013 and redesigned versions of its luxury Acura brand in the next three years, he said. Ito said Honda hasn’t fully recovered in China , where it reopened factories after anti-Japan protests eased. There are still safety concerns and problems with parts procurement, he said, without being more specific. The automaker’s plans for the world’s largest vehicle market remain unchanged, Ito said. Angry mobs attacked dealerships and smashed Japanese cars in Chinese cities after tensions between China and Japan flared up over ownership of a group of islands. A Honda Civic was set ablaze in front of a dealership in Shanghai on Sept 13. Honda targets expanding deliveries of motorcycles to 25 million units by March 2017 from 15 million in the period ended March this year, Ito said. The world’s largest motorcycle maker, which is developing a super sports bike, plans to produce large two-wheelers in Japan next year for sale to North America , and strengthen sales in Brazil , he said.

Lan Kwai Fong to Build Retail Project in China’s Wuxi City,['Kelvin Wong'],2012-09-21 16:00:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/lan-kwai-fong-to-build-retail-project-in-china-s-wuxi-city.html,"Lan Kwai Fong Holdings Ltd. , the developer of Hong Kong’s iconic stretch of bars and restaurants, will expand into Wuxi, China , as the nation’s growing middle class demands more entertainment choices. The developer signed a memorandum of understanding with the city government yesterday to jointly build a 140,000 square meter (1.5 million square feet) retail and restaurant complex, Chairman Allan Zeman said in a phone interview. The project will be the Hong Kong-based company’s third in mainland China. Lan Kwai Fong is seeking to expand in so-called second-tier cities in the country, where per-capita disposable income for urban households almost doubled in the last six years. The company, which has properties in Chengdu and Hainan Island, is also in talks to develop projects in cities including Qingdao, Ningbo and Chongqing, Zeman said. “Those in the second-tier cities have money and cars, but they also want to enjoy their lifestyle,” said Zeman, 64. “If you look at cities like Qingdao, when we go for dinner with the government officials, they ask if we actually want to go out; but there’s no place to go.” Zeman declined to say how much the company will invest in the Wuxi project. The project will have 40,000 square meters of bars and restaurants, 60,000 square meters of shops and 40,000 square meters of hotels and serviced apartments, he said. Hamburger Joint Hong Kong ’s Lan Kwai Fong, in the center of the former British colony’s central business district, has more than 100 restaurants and bars, not all controlled by the company. Zeman said in December the company plans to raise as much as $800 million to fund its China expansion and may consider a public offering. The original Lan Kwai Fong in Hong Kong started in the 1980s with a restaurant that served hamburgers, according to the company’s website. The stretch is now an after-work hangout for white-collar workers. A two-year redevelopment plan, which includes adding a 28- story building with terraces on every floor for smokers, who are banned from lighting up indoors, is scheduled to be completed by 2013, Zeman said in a January interview.

Otis Seeks 10% Growth Wooing China After Escalator Death,['Bloomberg News'],2012-09-21 12:32:15,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/united-technologies-opens-elevator-plant-targeting-western-china.html,"United Technologies Corp. (UTX) expects Chinese orders at its Otis elevator unit to grow at least 10 percent next year as the business wins customers back following a fatal escalator accident in Beijing. “What we are booking for next year is very good,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Louis R. Chenevert said today in an interview in Chongqing, China. “I am optimistic we will see double-digit order growth for next year.” United Technologies opened a new plant in Chongqing today, boosting its presence in a country that accounts for about half of worldwide elevator sales. Otis’s global head of strategy has moved to Shanghai as the company repairs its reputation after last year’s accident in the capital city’s subway system. About 30 people fell and one person died when an upward- bound escalator at a Beijing Zoo station exit abruptly changed direction in July 2011. The city suspended purchases of the company’s escalators after an investigation blamed faulty parts for the malfunction. China ’s equipment orders at Otis, the parent company’s third-biggest business, tumbled 13 percent in the second quarter after dropping 9 percent in the previous three months. Additional causes of the decline were China’s slowing economic growth and a price increase Otis adopted last year amid rising costs for rare-earth components, Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said yesterday at the Citi Global Industrials conference in Boston. China’s GDP China’s gross domestic product expanded 7.6 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the smallest gain in three years and the sixth quarterly deceleration. Growth may cool to 7.4 percent this quarter, based on the median estimate of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News from Sept. 11 to Sept. 18. The new factory, operating under the Xizi Otis brand, will build the Gen2 line of elevators targeting 20- to 40-story buildings in the region, Chenevert said today. The plant, which has an initial capacity to build 15,000 units a year, will help the company pare transportation costs as it caters to central and western provinces that account for 40 percent of its sales in the country. “There’s a lot of momentum embedded in the passion of Chinese here to adopt higher-standard of living,” he said. “They want their apartment, they want their cars, they want their air conditioning. This presents a lot of opportunities.” United Technologies also opened a “high-rise center of excellence” in Shanghai and streamlined the unit’s management structure, with China CEO Tom Vining now reporting directly to Otis President Pedro Baranda. Hangzhou Metro The moves are showing signs of paying off, Chenevert said Sept. 13 at the Morgan Stanley Industrials & Autos Conference in New York. The Hangzhou Metro ordered 299 escalators and 50 elevators from Otis for the first phase of its second line, the company said June 18 in a statement. Otis is on pace to regain an 18 percent to 19 percent share of the Chinese market by the end of this year, about the same level as before the Beijing subway accident and up from 11 percent at the end of the first quarter, Hayes said at the conference in Boston. United Technologies’ $16.5 billion Goodrich Corp. acquisition , which closed in July after approval by U.S., European and Canadian regulators, will be a “strong driver” for the company’s earnings next year, Chenevert said today.

Government bonds dropped. Overseas sales rose 0.4 percent from a year earlier, less than the 1.8 percent gain forecast in a Bloomberg survey, data showed today. Consumer prices climbed 1.3 percent, the least since August, according to a separate report. North Korea said on March 30 that a “state of war” exists with the South and threatened to shut a jointly run industrial zone in its border city of Gaeseong. Tensions have been rising since North Korea detonated a nuclear device in February and the U.S. and South Korea began military exercises last month. “A less-than-expected export growth and concerns stemming from North Korea are both negative for the won,” said Jeon Seung Ji, analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. in Seoul. “Still, a trade surplus and exporters’ dollar sales may keep the won from falling further.” The won was 0.3 percent weaker at 1,114.73 per dollar in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,116.88, the weakest since March 22. One-month implied volatility in the currency, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, increased 47 basis points, or 0.47 percentage point, to 7.91 percent.

Rousseff’s Stimulus Measures to Spur Brazil Economy: Timeline,['David Biller'],2013-04-01 18:19:18,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/rousseff-s-stimulus-measures-to-spur-brazil-economy-timeline.html,"Brazil ’s President Dilma Rousseff has implemented a series of measures since taking office to boost domestic demand and protect industry from imports. April 1: The finance ministry extends until the end of the year a tax cut on car sales that would have expired. The so-called IPI tax on cars was scheduled to increase from 2 percent to 3.5 percent on April 1. The measure will cost the government 2.2 billion reais ($1.1 billion) in tax revenue from April to December. March 9: Rousseff announces the elimination of the 9.25 percent PIS/Cofins taxes on staple foods. The measure, which will reduce tax revenue by 7.3 billion reais annually, is intended to increase consumption of food and other goods while helping to boost economic growth. Rousseff also eliminated the IPI tax for soap and sugar. Dec. 27, 2012: Brazil’s central bank eases reserve requirements on large banks. Banks with a minimum of 6 billion reais in total equity that provide credit for capital-goods investment may deduct as much as 20 percent of reserve requirements for their so-called “on call” deposits that can be withdrawn at any time. Dec. 24, 2012: Rousseff’s Cabinet chief Gleisi Hoffmann announces reduction of taxes on income from profit sharing programs. Dec. 19, 2012: Finance Minister Guido Mantega announces the extension of IPI tax cuts for automobiles, furniture, appliances and other goods through June, though at lower levels. Tax cuts for automobiles will ease gradually from January to June, and in February for other goods. Tax cuts for some goods, such as trucks and washing machines, will remain in place. Mantega also announces that retailers, excluding supermarkets, will be exempt from payroll taxes starting in April. This brings the number of sectors receiving the tax benefit to 42. Dec. 18, 2012: The central bank eases reserve requirements on short dollar positions. Financial institutions will be required to collect reserve requirements on short dollar positions above $3 billion, up from the previous $1 billion level. Dec. 6, 2012: Ports Secretary Leonidas Cristino announces a plan to increase private investment in the port system. The plan entails a new regulatory framework and investment of 54.2 billion reais through 2017, and includes a line of financing for port investments at the long-term lending rate, known as TJLP, plus up to 2.5 percent with a three-year grace period. The ports of Manaus, Porto Sul, Espirito Santo , Ilheus and Imbituba will be offered for private concession. Dec 5, 2012: Mantega announces that state development bank BNDES in January will cut its TJLP lending rate to 5 percent from 5.5 percent. He also says BNDES will extend for another year by 100 billion reais an emergency credit line established during the 2009 credit freeze to fund the purchase of capital goods. Private banks can join the lending program by counting up to 15 billion reais in loans against deposits they’re required to hold at the central bank. The central bank reduces the maturity of foreign loans subject to a 6 percent tax to one year from two years. Dec. 4, 2012: Mantega announces exemption of payroll tax and reduction of other taxes for civil construction. The tax relief for the sector totals 2.85 billion reais annually and the government will offer a line of credit to help finance new construction.

The central bank reduces the maturity of foreign loans subject to a 6 percent tax to one year from two years.

South Korea Exports Rise Less Than Estimated on Weaker Yen,['Eunkyung Seo' 'Cynthia Kim'],2013-04-01 00:28:47,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/south-korea-exports-rise-less-than-estimated-on-weaker-yen.html,"South Korean exports rose less than forecast last month as improving global demand for the country’s electronics and cars was tempered by a weaker Japanese yen. Overseas shipments rose 0.4 percent in March from a year earlier, after an 8.6 percent drop in February, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 11 economists was for a 1.8 percent gain. Consumer prices rose 1.3 percent last month from a year ago, according to a Statistics Korea report. Policy makers’ efforts to boost growth in Asia ’s fourth- largest economy have been aided by a won that’s declined 4.6 percent against the dollar since Jan. 1. President Park Geun Hye’s government has pledged to enact new stimulus measures this month after cutting the 2013 growth forecast to 2.3 percent from 3 percent last week. “Overall global demand is improving, though the pace is still slow,” Lee Sang Jae, a Seoul-based economist at Hyundai Securities Co., said before the release. “Policy makers want to drive the growth faster with every possible means.” Imports fell 2 percent from a year earlier in March, the ministry said today. The trade surplus widened to $3.4 billion from $2 billion in February. Even as the won fell against the dollar, the South Korean currency gained about 21 percent against the yen in the past six months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The economy expanded last year at the slowest pace since 2009. Weakening Yen South Korean companies have complained that the weakening Japanese yen is blunting their competitiveness. The Federation of Korean Industries, the nation’s largest business lobby group, said in February that with Haruhiko Kuroda leading the Bank of Japan (8301) , the yen will likely decline further. Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) said in January that currency gains could reduce its operating profit by 3 trillion won ($2.8 billion) this year. Kia Motors Corp. (000270) reported a 51 percent slump in operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2012, saying a difficult year is expected with a strengthening won.

Tesla Forecasts First Quarterly Profit on Model S Sales,['Rose Kim' 'Craig Trudell'],2013-04-01 13:49:48,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/tesla-forecasts-first-quarterly-profit-on-model-s-sales.html,"Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the electric-car maker headed by billionaire Elon Musk, climbed to a record after saying it turned its first quarterly profit on higher-than- forecasted sales of its Model S sedan, overcoming a controversy about the car’s performance. Tesla rose 13 percent to $42.94 at 9:42 a.m. New York time after surging as much as 14 percent to $43.33. The stock gained 12 percent this year through March 28, topping the 10 percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Tesla’s best closing price was $39.48 on Feb. 7. Tesla reached “full profitability” as Model S sales were more than 250 units higher than the 4,500 that the electric-car maker projected in mid-February, according to a company statement yesterday that didn’t specify the profit figure. The average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg calls for a loss of 11 cents a share, excluding some items. Tesla reached a profitability goal set by Musk, 41, as the Palo Alto , California-based company disputed a story about its Model S sedan by the New York Times that questioned the car’s driving range. Musk called the report “fake” and told Bloomberg Television it trimmed Tesla’s stock-market value by as much as $100 million. The public editor for the newspaper said its reporter didn’t use good judgment and “left himself open to valid criticism.” “It’s an important milestone that everyone has been waiting for, but it’s certainly not time to break out the champagne,” Michelle Krebs, an analyst for Santa Monica , California-based auto researcher Edmunds.com, said by telephone. “They’ve got to sustain sales and profits every quarter. This is just a step along a path that’s going to be bumpy.” ‘Exciting’ News Tesla said that its revised estimates are separate from the “really exciting” announcement that Musk alluded to in a Twitter post last week. That disclosure will be made tomorrow and is “arguably more important,” Musk said in a separate message on Twitter. Tesla said last month that it will repay by December 2017 the $465 million in U.S. Energy Department loans that it received to develop and build electric cars. The company’s fortunes are diverging from fellow loan recipient and electric- car maker Fisker Automotive Inc., which last week lost a potential automotive partner in China ’s Dongfeng Motor Group Co. and furloughed employees. Fisker also hired restructuring lawyers from Kirkland & Ellis LLP, a person familiar with the matter said last week. Tesla has forecast that deliveries of the battery-powered Model S will rise to a record 20,000 in 2013. The car starts at $59,900 and has a range of as far as 300 miles (483 kilometers) in ideal conditions when its 85-kilowatt-hour battery pack is fully charged.

"Panasonic Avionics Under U.S. Bribery Probe, WSJ Reports",['Grace Huang'],2013-04-01 14:08:14,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/panasonic-s-avionics-unit-under-u-s-bribery-probe-wsj-reports.html,"A Panasonic Corp. (6752) unit that makes inflight entertainment and communications systems for airlines is under a bribery investigation by U.S. regulators, the Wall Street Journal reported. The legal department of Panasonic Avionics, based in Lake Forest , California , told executives and employees to preserve documents that may be relevant to the government investigation, the newspaper said today, citing company documents. Chieko Gyobu, a spokeswoman for the Osaka , Japan-based parent company , declined to comment when reached by phone today. Employees were asked to preserve documents related to gifts or benefits offered to airline employees or government officials, as well as any that reported rumors, concerns or complaints of alleged bribery or corruption, the report said, citing a Jan. 20 company notice. Panasonic Avionics received a subpoena from government investigators last month, the Journal said, citing a March 25 company notice. Both notices reference the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S. companies and those listed on U.S. stock exchanges from paying bribes to foreign government officials, the report said. Spokespeople for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department , which enforce the act, declined to comment. The January notice said Panasonic intends to cooperate with the investigation and that the existence of any inquiry doesn’t mean the company broke the law, the newspaper said. Panasonic fell 3.4 percent to 632 yen in Tokyo trading, compared with a 2.1 percent drop in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. Revival Plan The company’s avionics unit is the “world leader” in inflight entertainment and communications, with the most systems installed and serving the most airlines, according to its website. Panasonic began expanding into avionics in 1979 and was among the first to market video equipment to airlines, it says. United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) , the world’s largest carrier and a customer of Panasonic Avionics’ satellite wireless Internet technology, declined to comment on whether it was involved in the probe, Rahsaan Johnson, a spokesman for the Chicago-based carrier, said in an e-mail. Other customers including Latam Airlines Group SA, Emirates and Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) didn’t immediately return calls or e-mails seeking comments. Record Loss Panasonic is struggling to recover from a record loss in the year ended March 2012. The company said last week it plans to revive profit at its TV-making unit and boost sales of housing products to meet a target for operating income of 350 billion yen ($3.7 billion) in three years. The company is targeting growth in business-to-business segments, which include the avionics unit and navigation systems and batteries for cars. Its revival measures also include selling control of its logistics unit and the possible sale of a stake in its health-care division. Panasonic has forecast a net loss of 765 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, following a 772 billion-yen loss the previous 12 months.

Mazda3 Seen Crucial to Extending Rally on Weaker Yen,['Ma Jie' 'Masatsugu Horie'],2013-04-02 09:24:31,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/mazda3-seen-crucial-to-extending-rally-on-weaker-yen.html,"The slide in the yen has turned Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) ’s biggest weakness into its biggest strength. All Japan ’s most export-dependent automaker has to do now is sell more cars. Japan’s fifth-largest car company has the wind of the yen’s 16 percent descent in the past six months in its sails. Shares have tripled to their highest level since 2008 as more- profitable exports and cost reductions steer Mazda toward its first annual profit in five years. Despite Mazda’s status as the top performer on Japan’s benchmark stock index over the past six months, the Hiroshima- based carmaker needs to make a hit out of a new version of the Mazda3, its top seller, due this fiscal year, to prove it doesn’t require a weak yen to compete against its bigger rivals. “It’s very critical,” Ashvin Chotai , London-based managing director of Intelligence Automotive Asia , said of the Mazda3, which accounts for a third of the automaker’s sales. “Mazda is a small company and they can’t afford to make any mistakes.” Few companies better illustrate how Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is reversing Japan’s fortunes by weakening the yen. About a year ago, Mazda was so desperate for cash that it printed 1.22 billion new shares, equivalent to almost 70 percent of outstanding stock, at the expense of existing investors, who saw their holdings diluted. The stock fell to record lows. Now, the cheaper local currency is giving Mazda Chief Executive Takashi Yamanouchi, 68, breathing room to show his turnaround efforts are bearing fruit and for the company to focus on rolling out new models. Profit Boost The yen’s drop to a 3 1/2-year low -- it is about 93 to the dollar now -- has turned its operations in the U.S., Mazda’s biggest market, more profitable. For the fiscal year that ended March 31, Mazda has projected it would post a profit of 26 billion yen ($279 million), emerging from a loss of 107.7 billion yen the previous year, though its global sales target was only slightly higher. Mazda said it may report earnings at the end of this month. The weaker yen is projected to boost profit for the January-March quarter. Mazda based its 25.4 billion yen quarterly operating income forecast on rates of 85 yen per dollar and 110 per euro. The Japanese currency has never been that strong in 2013. It’s still expensive based on its average of about 107 to the dollar over the past 20 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A one-yen change against the dollar, euro, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar has a 9.1 percent impact on Mazda’s operating profit, according to estimates of Bank of America Corp., based on Mazda’s own forecast for the current fiscal year. That compares with 4.7 percent at Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (7270) , which makes Subaru cars, and 3.1 percent at Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  Positive View The cheaper yen has encouraged analysts to boost their ratings on Mazda. About 50 percent of those who cover the stock rated it a buy at the start of March, the highest level since August 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock fell 2.6 percent to 262 yen at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined 1.1 percent. It has gained 51 percent this year, compared with a 15 percent rise in the Nikkei index. Mazda shares are trading at about 10 times estimated earnings for the coming fiscal year, in line with other Japanese automakers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Honda Motor Co. is valued at 10 times estimated earnings, while Toyota shares have a multiple of 11. Advanced Research Japan analyst Koji Endo said his view is “positive” even though Mazda’s price has tripled from its historic low last year. “As long as the yen stays at around 90-95 against the dollar, Mazda’s profits could double in the fiscal year to March 2014,” he said. Environmentally Friendly Takashi Aoki, a fund manager at Mizuho Asset Management, said he has also expected a jump in Mazda earnings this year. However, Mazda is still too reliant on the yen, he said. “If the Japanese currency goes up to more than 90 yen versus dollar once again, which is not unlikely, it can be a risk to Mazda,” he said. The company’s drive to more than triple profit by 2016 calls for car sales to increase by more than one-third. Top- selling models are being reintroduced with fuel-saving engines Mazda spent billions of dollars developing as its own answer to the demand for more environmentally friendly cars. The Mazda6, on sale in the U.S. since January, and the Mazda3, expected later this year, will compete against market leaders like Toyota’s Camry and Corolla. Together, the pair make up about half of all Mazda sales. Elusive Details Details about the next Mazda3, including when it will be introduced, remain elusive. Mazda won’t comment on whether the car follows similar design lines to the Mazda6. The Mazda6, also set to go on sale in China later this year, will probably shed light on how the new generation of cars might fare in the market. The Mazda6 was designed to convey the company’s determination to do things its own way, according to project manager Hiroshi Kajiyama. “We are a small carmaker, so we wanted to make it a distinct car with Mazda’s characteristics, make it the flagship car,” Kajiyama said, speaking in an interview in March. Five Drivers Kajiyama said the Mazda6 design project involved finding five Mazda fans in different countries and studying their lifestyle, interests, driving habits for about a week. The goal was to figure out what their ideal Mazda would be, Kajiyama said. The car’s external shape is sculpted to cut wind resistance and boost handling, and heated seats are supposed to mold themselves to the shape of their occupiers. It’s an embodiment of Mazda’s philosophy of “car and driver as one,” he said. Mazda was inspired by the fans’ suggestions to move the driver and passenger compartment toward the rear of the car, giving its nose and bonnet a sloping, aerodynamic look without compromising on trunk space. The accelerator pedal is also made more sensitive to driver foot pressure. Satomi Hamada, a Tokyo-based analyst at IHS Automotive, said Mazda’s choice with the Mazda6 design shows the company’s determination to make cars that stand out. “It is extremely rare for carmakers to design a mainstream car using just five people as a data sample,” Hamada said. Ford Stake The global economic slowdown that followed the 2008 financial crisis, combined with the yen’s rise to near post- World War II record levels, sent Mazda to losses. A long-standing relationship with Ford frayed. Having once owned about a third of Mazda, the U.S. automaker began cutting its stake in 2008 to raise cash as it struggled to cope with the impact of the financial crisis. It now owns 2 percent of the Japanese company. As demand for environmentally friendly vehicles grew, industry rivals developed hybrid gasoline-electric cars or plug- in battery-powered vehicles. Mazda went its own way. It began work on what it calls SkyActiv cars, named for a suite of technology applications based on conventional diesel and gasoline engines. These includes new automatic transmissions and lighter car frames to cut down on fuel use while increasing engine output. Mazda declines to say how much it has invested in SkyActiv. The automaker typically spends about 100 billion yen each year on research and development, according to its financial statements. Mazda will incorporate SkyActiv technologies in the Lafester minivan it will produce for Nissan and an open-top sports car it has agreed to produce for Fiat SpA (F) under the Alfa Romeo brand. Cutting Costs Mazda has cut production costs by 20 percent and boosted profit margins by increasing efficiency in logistics and eliminating waste, according to the company. It says the SkyActiv technology means it can break even on exports even when the yen is stronger than now: Its CX-5 sport-utility vehicle, the first to make full use of SkyActiv systems, would make money even if the yen traded at 77 to the dollar, Mazda says. The early response to the CX-5, introduced in February 2012, offers Mazda some hope. It was named Japan’s “Car of the Year” last November by the industry panel that oversees the annual award and has sold more than 190,938 units in its first year in market, compared with Mazda’s target of 190,000 units. Mazda aims to raise operating income to 150 billion yen and introduce a total of eight models that fully adopt SkyActiv by March 2016. The company says its annual sales target by then will be 1.7 million cars, more than a third above current levels. Mexico Plant Mazda is opening a plant in Mexico that’s scheduled to start production in 2014. It also raised the planned initial production capacity at the plant in Salamanca City, Guanajuato State to 230,000 cars from 140,000 in order to meet the increasing global demand for SkyActiv models, as well as for production of a vehicle for Toyota, it said last year. Mazda declined to say whether the cars it produces for Toyota in Mexico will also use the technologies. Still, Mazda’s sensitivity to yen’s fluctuations will not change, at least until production begins in Mexico. “Eventually, you need to have higher localization rate in the longer term. Mazda is in the right direction,” said Goldman’s Yuzawa. “But it’s too early to say their sensitivity is going to go down, so we have to bet on currency when we invest in Mazda.” To contact the reporters on this story: Ma Jie in Tokyo at  jma124@bloomberg.net ; Masatsugu Horie in Osaka at  mhorie3@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at  ycho2@bloomberg.net",['Ma JieMasatsugu Horie'],"Mazda3 Seen Crucial to Extending Rally on Weaker Yen The slide in the yen has turned Mazda Motor Corp.

Environmentally Friendly Takashi Aoki, a fund manager at Mizuho Asset Management, said he has also expected a jump in Mazda earnings this year. However, Mazda is still too reliant on the yen, he said. “If the Japanese currency goes up to more than 90 yen versus dollar once again, which is not unlikely, it can be a risk to Mazda,” he said. The company’s drive to more than triple profit by 2016 calls for car sales to increase by more than one-third. Top- selling models are being reintroduced with fuel-saving engines Mazda spent billions of dollars developing as its own answer to the demand for more environmentally friendly cars. The Mazda6, on sale in the U.S. since January, and the Mazda3, expected later this year, will compete against market leaders like Toyota’s Camry and Corolla. Together, the pair make up about half of all Mazda sales. Elusive Details Details about the next Mazda3, including when it will be introduced, remain elusive. Mazda won’t comment on whether the car follows similar design lines to the Mazda6. The Mazda6, also set to go on sale in China later this year, will probably shed light on how the new generation of cars might fare in the market. The Mazda6 was designed to convey the company’s determination to do things its own way, according to project manager Hiroshi Kajiyama. “We are a small carmaker, so we wanted to make it a distinct car with Mazda’s characteristics, make it the flagship car,” Kajiyama said, speaking in an interview in March. Five Drivers Kajiyama said the Mazda6 design project involved finding five Mazda fans in different countries and studying their lifestyle, interests, driving habits for about a week. The goal was to figure out what their ideal Mazda would be, Kajiyama said. The car’s external shape is sculpted to cut wind resistance and boost handling, and heated seats are supposed to mold themselves to the shape of their occupiers. It’s an embodiment of Mazda’s philosophy of “car and driver as one,” he said. Mazda was inspired by the fans’ suggestions to move the driver and passenger compartment toward the rear of the car, giving its nose and bonnet a sloping, aerodynamic look without compromising on trunk space. The accelerator pedal is also made more sensitive to driver foot pressure. Satomi Hamada, a Tokyo-based analyst at IHS Automotive, said Mazda’s choice with the Mazda6 design shows the company’s determination to make cars that stand out. “It is extremely rare for carmakers to design a mainstream car using just five people as a data sample,” Hamada said. Ford Stake The global economic slowdown that followed the 2008 financial crisis, combined with the yen’s rise to near post- World War II record levels, sent Mazda to losses. A long-standing relationship with Ford frayed. Having once owned about a third of Mazda, the U.S. automaker began cutting its stake in 2008 to raise cash as it struggled to cope with the impact of the financial crisis. It now owns 2 percent of the Japanese company. As demand for environmentally friendly vehicles grew, industry rivals developed hybrid gasoline-electric cars or plug- in battery-powered vehicles. Mazda went its own way. It began work on what it calls SkyActiv cars, named for a suite of technology applications based on conventional diesel and gasoline engines. These includes new automatic transmissions and lighter car frames to cut down on fuel use while increasing engine output. Mazda declines to say how much it has invested in SkyActiv. The automaker typically spends about 100 billion yen each year on research and development, according to its financial statements. Mazda will incorporate SkyActiv technologies in the Lafester minivan it will produce for Nissan and an open-top sports car it has agreed to produce for Fiat SpA (F) under the Alfa Romeo brand. Cutting Costs Mazda has cut production costs by 20 percent and boosted profit margins by increasing efficiency in logistics and eliminating waste, according to the company. It says the SkyActiv technology means it can break even on exports even when the yen is stronger than now: Its CX-5 sport-utility vehicle, the first to make full use of SkyActiv systems, would make money even if the yen traded at 77 to the dollar, Mazda says. The early response to the CX-5, introduced in February 2012, offers Mazda some hope. It was named Japan’s “Car of the Year” last November by the industry panel that oversees the annual award and has sold more than 190,938 units in its first year in market, compared with Mazda’s target of 190,000 units. Mazda aims to raise operating income to 150 billion yen and introduce a total of eight models that fully adopt SkyActiv by March 2016. The company says its annual sales target by then will be 1.7 million cars, more than a third above current levels. Mexico Plant Mazda is opening a plant in Mexico that’s scheduled to start production in 2014. It also raised the planned initial production capacity at the plant in Salamanca City, Guanajuato State to 230,000 cars from 140,000 in order to meet the increasing global demand for SkyActiv models, as well as for production of a vehicle for Toyota, it said last year. Mazda declined to say whether the cars it produces for Toyota in Mexico will also use the technologies. Still, Mazda’s sensitivity to yen’s fluctuations will not change, at least until production begins in Mexico. “Eventually, you need to have higher localization rate in the longer term. Mazda is in the right direction,” said Goldman’s Yuzawa. “But it’s too early to say their sensitivity is going to go down, so we have to bet on currency when we invest in Mazda.” To contact the reporters on this story: Ma Jie in Tokyo at  jma124@bloomberg.net ; Masatsugu Horie in Osaka at  mhorie3@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at  ycho2@bloomberg.net",9733,1650,12
Tesla Advances to Record on First Quarterly Profit,['Rose Kim' 'Craig Trudell'],2013-04-01 20:17:59,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/tesla-says-it-turned-profitable-as-model-s-sales-beat-forecast.html,"Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the electric-car maker headed by billionaire Elon Musk, climbed to a record after saying it turned its first quarterly profit on higher-than- forecast sales of its controversial Model S sedan. Tesla (TSLA) rose 16 percent to $43.93 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 30 percent this year, topping the 9.5 percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Tesla’s previous closing high was $39.48 on Feb. 7. Tesla’s profitability is a milestone for a company that has been at the center of debate over the future of electric cars. The Palo Alto, California-based company sold more Model S sedans than it had previously projected, as Musk, 41, led the defense against a New York Times story in February that questioned the car’s driving range. “For Tesla to be in the black is a positive sign, and it’s a little bit surprising given the lukewarm reception we’ve seen with a lot of the other electric vehicles in the marketplace today,” Alec Gutierrez, an analyst with auto-market researcher Kelley Blue Book, said by telephone. Tesla sold at least 250 more Model S sedans than the 4,500 units it had forecast in February. As a result, the company reached “full profitability” during the first quarter, according to a Tesla statement yesterday that didn’t specify the profit figure. The average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg calls for a loss of 11 cents a share, excluding some items. Tesla hasn’t previously reported a quarterly profit in its three years as a public company. Reduced Risk “The progress on sales and profitability significantly reduces risk around TSLA’s cash flows, which have been a primary area of investor concern,” Elaine Kwei, an analyst at Jefferies Group, wrote today in a report. “We expect a high level of media attention over the next several days and correspondingly higher levels of activity in the stock,” wrote Kwei, who has a buy rating on the stock. Tesla’s Model S has been at the center of disputes over the viability of electric cars that intensified following a Feb. 8 story in the New York Times. The article detailed a test drive between Washington and Boston that ended with a stalled Model S being loaded onto a tow truck. Musk called the Times’ report “fake” and told Bloomberg Television that it trimmed Tesla’s stock-market value by as much as $100 million. The public editor for the newspaper said its reporter didn’t use good judgment and “left himself open to valid criticism.” Bumpy Path “All that publicity certainly didn’t hurt, and it might have helped,” Michelle Krebs, an analyst for Santa Monica, California-based auto researcher Edmunds.com, said by telephone. “They’ve got to sustain sales and profits every quarter. This is just a step along a path that’s going to be bumpy.” Tesla said in yesterday’s statement that it will no longer produce the smallest battery option for Model S, citing lack of demand. The 40-kilowatt-hour version of the car contributed only 4 percent of orders for Model S, the company said. Tesla said that its revised profitability forecast is separate from the “really exciting” announcement that Musk alluded to in a Twitter post last week. That disclosure will be made tomorrow and is “arguably more important,” Musk said in a separate message on Twitter. Leasing Program Musk told analysts on a conference call in February that Tesla would like to begin to offer leasing in the second half of this year. Tomorrow’s announcement could be related to details of a Model S leasing program in the U.S., Ben Schuman, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst who rates the shares the equivalent of a hold, wrote today in a report. Tesla said last month that it will repay by December 2017 the $465 million in U.S. Energy Department loans that it received to develop and build electric cars. The company’s fortunes are diverging from fellow loan recipient and electric- car maker Fisker Automotive Inc., which last week lost a potential automotive partner in China ’s Dongfeng Motor Group Co. and furloughed employees. Fisker, based in Anaheim, California , also hired restructuring lawyers from Kirkland & Ellis LLP, a person familiar with the matter said last week. Tesla has forecast that deliveries of the battery-powered Model S will rise to a record 20,000 in 2013. The car starts at $59,900 and has a range of as far as 300 miles (483 kilometers) in ideal conditions when its 85-kilowatt-hour battery pack is fully charged.

Japan Auto Sales Fall on Subsidy End as Korea Extends Drop,['Anna Mukai' 'Masatsugu Horie' 'Rose Kim'],2013-04-02 07:49:16,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/japan-auto-sales-fall-on-end-of-subsidies-as-korea-extends-slump.html,"Japanese vehicle sales fell the most in six quarters after government subsidies ended, while deliveries in South Korea extended their slump. The number of vehicles sold in Japan, Asia ’s second-largest auto market, fell 9.4 percent to 1.53 million during the quarter, with Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) seeing a 15 percent drop, according to association data released yesterday. In South Korea , the region’s fourth-largest vehicle market, deliveries declined 2.5 percent as Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) saw a 0.7 percent contraction, based on company statements. Slumping demand at home underscores how Asian carmakers may need to increase their reliance on overseas markets this year. Toyota-led Japan Inc. is better off because the yen has depreciated against all major currencies since mid-November, while Hyundai and other Korean exporters have seen the won appreciate more than 13 percent against the yen. Japanese vehicle sales -- including cars and buses -- dropped for a second straight quarter after government subsidies on fuel-efficient cars expired in September. Deliveries will probably shrink 12 percent to 4.74 million units this year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. “There won’t be many major launches this year,” said Yoshiaki Kawano, a Tokyo-based analyst at industry researcher IHS Automotive said by phone. “Until the Tokyo Motor Show at the end of the year, the sales decline will likely drag on.” Deliveries in the quarter at Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan’s second-largest carmaker, fell 6 percent to 165,931 units in its home market and Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s sales tumbled 43 percent to 92,579 units. In Korea, vehicle sales fell to 321,420 units last quarter, based on tallies of company statements. The Korean government last week cut its economic growth forecast for the second time in four months, prompting the Finance Ministry to say it will unveil a stimulus package this month.

"Ethanol Has Its Place, but Not in Gasoline",['the Editors'],2013-04-01 22:30:02,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/etahnol-has-its-place-but-not-in-gasoline.html,"U.S. oil production has reached a 20-year high and, since March 2012, demand for gasoline has fallen almost 5 percent. So why have prices at the pump jumped? From mid-December through the end of February they rose almost 20 percent, though they have declined a bit in recent weeks. Some of the blame for the increase goes to the federal mandate on ethanol use in the U.S. fuel supply. Fuel blenders are required to mix 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol with gasoline this year, under an energy bill passed in 2005 and revised two years later -- at a time before domestic energy production surged and motorists began using less gasoline. Now, the fixed ethanol mandate could force blenders to make gasoline that’s more than 10 percent ethanol -- more than some cars are equipped to burn. Some automakers have said that using a mix of 15 percent ethanol , which the Environmental Protection Agency plans to order blenders to produce, might void engine warranties. The solution for blenders is to buy credits, which give them a break on how much ethanol they must mix into the gasoline they sell. The price of credits has soared, however, reaching more than $1 a gallon in early March, after trading at just 7 cents in January. Court Ruling The same law, the Energy Independence and Security Act, requires refiners and blenders to use ethanol derived from cellulosic fiber, such as grass, wood and agricultural waste. The trouble is, there’s not enough ethanol from these materials to meet EPA targets. A federal appeals court in January had the good sense to reject that mandate, though it seems as if the EPA didn’t get the message: The agency increased the amount of cellulosic ethanol that blenders are supposed to use next year. Some members of Congress asked the EPA to suspend the ethanol mandate amid last summer’s drought , the worst in more than 50 years. Most U.S. ethanol is produced from corn; about 40 percent of the nation’s harvest, the world’s largest, goes to fuel production. Although corn prices have dropped from the highs of last year, they are still about a fourth higher than they were in June. The ethanol mandate has been blamed for an array of market distortions, including soaring farmland prices, environmental degradation (as marginal soils and wetlands are cultivated) and higher global food costs. Ethanol from corn may not even be a net positive in terms of energy output -- some scientists say the amount of energy used to produce ethanol from corn is larger than the amount it yields. That undermines claims that ethanol use reduces greenhouse-gas emissions. Rather than require blenders to mix a fixed quantity of ethanol into gasoline, the EPA should let them use the amount needed to maintain a 10 percent mix and abandon plans to require a 15 percent blend. If gasoline consumption keeps falling, consumers should be able to benefit from lower prices. Better yet, Congress should end the outdated mandate altogether. Ethanol may have its place. It can help gasoline burn more efficiently in older car engines , and is less toxic than the alternatives used to boost fuel octane ratings. Those advantages shouldn’t be compromised by a rigid rule that contributes to higher gasoline prices.

Mumbai Gets Closure on Its 20-Year Terror Trauma,['Ch' 'rahas Choudhury'],2013-04-01 20:39:55,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/mumbai-gets-closure-on-its-20-year-terror-trauma.html,"(Corrects sequence of events in 25th paragraph of article published April 1.) In late 1992 and early 1993, a series of violent events took place in India that damaged, perhaps irredeemably, the commitment of both state and society to the country's hard-won secularism and vulnerable interfaith harmony.  First, on Dec. 6, 1992, in the northern town of Ayodhya, a small army of frenzied Hindu right-wing activists tore down the Babri Masjid, a 16th-century mosque built by the Mughal dynasty. In India's civilizational memory, Ayodhya is the birthplace of Rama, the legendary Hindu king of the epic t he Ramayana and a central figure in the political imagination. Through the 1980s, India had been racked by agitation among Hindu militant groups to rebuild a temple that had once stood on the site of the mosque.  After the mosque was ignominiously brought down, without the state or central governments having done enough to protect it, Hindus and Muslims across the country were inflamed variously by triumph, vindication, rage, resentment and despair. Religious riots broke out across the country, killing more than 2,000 people, a substantial number of them in Bombay (now Mumbai), India's financial capital and its most liberal and cosmopolitan city. The secular fabric of the city was destroyed by the rioting , much of it instigated by the thuggish demagogue Bal Thackeray (who died late last year) and his party, the Shiv Sena.   Most of those killed in Bombay were Muslims, who comprised more than 15 percent of the city's population. Bombay was on edge for days, as citizens locked themselves in their homes and gangs rampaged. I was then a schoolboy living in a city suburb, and memories of those terrible days are still vivid to me. When peace was finally brokered, it didn't last long. On the afternoon of March 12, 1993, powerful bombs went off simultaneously in 13 locations in Bombay, including the Stock Exchange, three prominent hotels and two marketplaces, killing more than 250 people and maiming hundreds. As the city reeled with shock once again, the police ran down many leads .  Within days, the bombings were revealed to have been the plot of the underworld boss Dawood Ibrahim , who had earned his stripes in murderous gang wars in the 1970s and 1980s and now ran his international crime syndicate, the D-Company, out of Dubai.  With help from Pakistan's nebulous intelligence service the ISI (which has a long history of supporting terrorism ) and his many local contacts in Bombay, the city of his birth, Dawood had designed the attacks as retribution for the violence visited on  Muslims during the communal riots.  In the days after the bombings, hundreds of suspects were rounded up (even as it became clear that the mastermind, Dawood's henchman, Tiger Memon, had already left the country). People were arrested and put into jail, charges were filed and a trial began that, including appeals, would last two decades. Eleven days ago, India's Supreme Court passed final judgment upon the matter, upholding the death sentence handed down to the gangster Yakub Memon (Tiger's brother) in 2006, while commuting the death sentences of 10 others to life imprisonment. The judgment was received in India, as an editorial in the Hindu newspaper judiciously observed, "" with a sense of ending, not closure ."" This was because the state hadn't been able to secure the two ""absconding key conspirators,"" Dawood Ibrahim and Tiger Memon -- both of whom are known to reside in Pakistan, and in Dawood's case, in a state of pharaonic pomp , his international syndicate stronger than ever.  While much of the media attention focused on the five-year jail sentence for the actor Sanjay Dutt for the illegal possession of arms, note was also taken of the sentences in the Supreme Court judgment that dealt with the Pakistani intelligence establishment's role in the bombings. As the prominent Indian lawyer Soli Sorabjee noted in the Indian Express : The 1993 Mumbai blasts have come to occupy a more prominent place in Indian public memory than subsequent terrorist attacks, such as the equally heinous ones of 2008 for which the Pakistani terrorist Mohammed Ajmal Kasab was hanged late last year.  For one thing, the 1993 attacks were the first major terrorist incidents in a city that has since become resigned to facing them.  Second, they were plotted by a man who was at that point an Indian national -- in fact, the son of a Bombay police constable -- and a gangster of whom many Bombayites were secretly quite proud. Many locals were employed to drop off the cars laden with bombs, and the explosive RDX used for the blasts was shipped into the country by paying off Indian customs officers. The blasts revealed serious flaws in India's internal security and civil society that haven't yet been adequately addressed. Third, the bombings and their major and minor protagonists have been extensively and memorably depicted in journalism and cinema, such as in the journalist S.Hussain Zaidi 's extensively researched book ""Black Friday: The True Story of the Bombay Bomb Blasts"" and Anurag Kashyap's magnificent film based on that book. It wasn't just Dawood Ibrahim who acquired near-mythic status. Other protagonists of the case, such as the policeman Rakesh Maria and the publicity-shy judge hearing the trial, Pramod Kode , did too. The same goes for Zaidi himself, who recently produced a book tracing Dawood's family background, his beginnings in Bombay's gang wars and his many connections to the city's elites.  As Zaidi observed in an interview last year, Bollywood, Bombay's glitzy and all-pervading film industry, "" idolised Dawood as India's Don Corleone .""

In late 1992 and early 1993, a series of violent events took place in India that damaged, perhaps irredeemably, the commitment of both state and society to the country's hard-won secularism and vulnerable interfaith harmony.  First, on Dec. 6, 1992, in the northern town of Ayodhya, a small army of frenzied Hindu right-wing activists tore down the Babri Masjid, a 16th-century mosque built by the Mughal dynasty. In India's civilizational memory, Ayodhya is the birthplace of Rama, the legendary Hindu king of the epic t he Ramayana and a central figure in the political imagination. Through the 1980s, India had been racked by agitation among Hindu militant groups to rebuild a temple that had once stood on the site of the mosque.  After the mosque was ignominiously brought down, without the state or central governments having done enough to protect it, Hindus and Muslims across the country were inflamed variously by triumph, vindication, rage, resentment and despair. Religious riots broke out across the country, killing more than 2,000 people, a substantial number of them in Bombay (now Mumbai), India's financial capital and its most liberal and cosmopolitan city. The secular fabric of the city was destroyed by the rioting , much of it instigated by the thuggish demagogue Bal Thackeray (who died late last year) and his party, the Shiv Sena.   Most of those killed in Bombay were Muslims, who comprised more than 15 percent of the city's population. Bombay was on edge for days, as citizens locked themselves in their homes and gangs rampaged. I was then a schoolboy living in a city suburb, and memories of those terrible days are still vivid to me. When peace was finally brokered, it didn't last long. On the afternoon of March 12, 1993, powerful bombs went off simultaneously in 13 locations in Bombay, including the Stock Exchange, three prominent hotels and two marketplaces, killing more than 250 people and maiming hundreds. As the city reeled with shock once again, the police ran down many leads .  Within days, the bombings were revealed to have been the plot of the underworld boss Dawood Ibrahim , who had earned his stripes in murderous gang wars in the 1970s and 1980s and now ran his international crime syndicate, the D-Company, out of Dubai.  With help from Pakistan's nebulous intelligence service the ISI (which has a long history of supporting terrorism ) and his many local contacts in Bombay, the city of his birth, Dawood had designed the attacks as retribution for the violence visited on  Muslims during the communal riots.  In the days after the bombings, hundreds of suspects were rounded up (even as it became clear that the mastermind, Dawood's henchman, Tiger Memon, had already left the country). People were arrested and put into jail, charges were filed and a trial began that, including appeals, would last two decades. Eleven days ago, India's Supreme Court passed final judgment upon the matter, upholding the death sentence handed down to the gangster Yakub Memon (Tiger's brother) in 2006, while commuting the death sentences of 10 others to life imprisonment. The judgment was received in India, as an editorial in the Hindu newspaper judiciously observed, "" with a sense of ending, not closure ."" This was because the state hadn't been able to secure the two ""absconding key conspirators,"" Dawood Ibrahim and Tiger Memon -- both of whom are known to reside in Pakistan, and in Dawood's case, in a state of pharaonic pomp , his international syndicate stronger than ever.  While much of the media attention focused on the five-year jail sentence for the actor Sanjay Dutt for the illegal possession of arms, note was also taken of the sentences in the Supreme Court judgment that dealt with the Pakistani intelligence establishment's role in the bombings. As the prominent Indian lawyer Soli Sorabjee noted in the Indian Express : The 1993 Mumbai blasts have come to occupy a more prominent place in Indian public memory than subsequent terrorist attacks, such as the equally heinous ones of 2008 for which the Pakistani terrorist Mohammed Ajmal Kasab was hanged late last year.  For one thing, the 1993 attacks were the first major terrorist incidents in a city that has since become resigned to facing them.  Second, they were plotted by a man who was at that point an Indian national -- in fact, the son of a Bombay police constable -- and a gangster of whom many Bombayites were secretly quite proud. Many locals were employed to drop off the cars laden with bombs, and the explosive RDX used for the blasts was shipped into the country by paying off Indian customs officers. The blasts revealed serious flaws in India's internal security and civil society that haven't yet been adequately addressed. Third, the bombings and their major and minor protagonists have been extensively and memorably depicted in journalism and cinema, such as in the journalist S.Hussain Zaidi 's extensively researched book ""Black Friday: The True Story of the Bombay Bomb Blasts"" and Anurag Kashyap's magnificent film based on that book. It wasn't just Dawood Ibrahim who acquired near-mythic status. Other protagonists of the case, such as the policeman Rakesh Maria and the publicity-shy judge hearing the trial, Pramod Kode , did too. The same goes for Zaidi himself, who recently produced a book tracing Dawood's family background, his beginnings in Bombay's gang wars and his many connections to the city's elites.  As Zaidi observed in an interview last year, Bollywood, Bombay's glitzy and all-pervading film industry, "" idolised Dawood as India's Don Corleone ."" It helped, of course, that even though he is a Muslim, Dawood wasn't an Islamist in the mold of Osama bin Laden. His relationship with Pakistani terror networks is one of convenience, not of shared ideological convictions. Zaidi conducted the last available interview with Dawood, in 1997. It's worth reading both for how Dawood cleverly plays the ingenue, disclaiming responsibility for all the charges against him, while also baring his fangs. (""Zaidi Saheb, because I respect you, I pardon such an irreverent line of questioning."")  A survey by Forbes magazine in 2009 listed Dawood at No. 50 among the world's most powerful people.

Five-Car Families Seen Deterring Thai Rate Cuts: Southeast Asia,['Suttinee Yuvejwattana'],2013-04-02 03:51:46,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/five-car-families-seen-deterring-thai-rate-cuts-southeast-asia.html,"Chitwalai Srisaengchai bought a car last year to take advantage of a Thai tax rebate and now spends 70 percent of her salary on the loan. She’s also giving the central bank another reason to resist monetary easing. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra’s stimulus measures have stoked spending and contributed to rising household debt, prompting the Bank of Thailand to say it will monitor “persistently high” credit growth. About 1.25 million Thais have taken up the car-buying incentive the government introduced to boost domestic consumption after the 2011 floods, helping drive local car sales to a record last year. “It was a very tempting offer,” said Chitwalai, a 27- year-old English teacher in Bangkok who will receive a 100,000- baht ($3,400) rebate on a black Mazda 2 sedan she bought for 705,000 baht, adding to her family’s four cars. “Something like this may not happen ever again, so I had to do it.” Chitwalai’s purchase highlights why Thailand’s central bank may resist government pressure to cut interest rates tomorrow as Yingluck seeks to sustain growth. Lower borrowing costs may spur demand for personal loans that jumped 22 percent in 2012, the biggest increase in seven years, adding debt risks that threaten to heighten the economy’s vulnerability to a slowdown. “The BoT has already sounded warnings and is likely to pursue a more moderate pace of consumer-loan growth,” said Eugene Leow, an economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore. “The fast pace of consumer debt accumulation could lead to an increase in non-performing loans when the cycle turns. It suggests the policy rate is not going lower.” Cool Inflows The baht has risen 4.3 percent against the dollar this year. On March 20 it reached the strongest level since the currency’s devaluation in July 1997 sparked the Asian financial crisis. The benchmark SET Index rose to its highest since 1994 on March 15. Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong last month reiterated his call for lower rates and a weaker currency to cool inflows and help exporters. Central bank Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul has said no special measures are needed to stem inflows, even as he added that the baht has strengthened too fast recently. Automakers Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. have stepped up production in Thailand as the tax rebates boosted demand. Fitch Ratings raised its assessment of the nation last month, citing a resilient economy and a more stable political climate, while the central bank said in March it may raise its gross domestic product estimate for this year to more than 5 percent after faster-than-estimated growth in the fourth quarter. ‘Tough Call’ “It will be a tough call for the central bank, with the baht strength and pressure from the government,” said Santitarn Sathirathai, a Singapore-based economist at Credit Suisse Group AG. “The better economic growth outlook and the sharp growth in personal loans show that no further easing is needed.” Seventeen of 18 economists in a Bloomberg survey predict borrowing costs will be held at 2.75 percent for a fourth meeting tomorrow. One expects a quarter percentage-point cut. Policy makers across Asia are battling the risk of asset- price bubbles from increased inflows. Emerging Asia stocks had $9.5 billion of inflows in the first quarter this year, according to Citigroup Inc., compared with $1.8 billion of inflows in the same period a year earlier. Credit Growth Average Thai household debt rose from 82,485 baht per household in 2002 to 134,900 baht in 2011, according to the National Statistics Office. The rebate program has cost the state about 90 billion baht, according to government estimates. The government’s increased spending has resulted in a slow deterioration in its balance sheet and the “high-speed credit growth” could pose financial risks for Thailand, Kim Eng Tan, senior director at Standard & Poor’s , said on Jan. 24. The central bank will closely monitor risks stemming from “the ongoing high credit growth, particularly for consumer credit , as well as a surge in household debts which have had some effects on households’ debt servicing abilities,” the monetary policy committee said in the minutes of its Feb. 20 meeting published on March 6. The Thai excise department set up a team of 10 in February to monitor delinquency after a number of buyers defaulted on their loans, said Director-General Somchai Poolsavasdi. So far, about 2,000 have dropped out, he said, adding that “the number is still very small, so we are not worried.” Debt Trap Personal loans without repayment for more than three months rose 20.5 percent to 56.6 billion baht, or 22.3 percent of total bad debt in the fourth quarter, according to central bank data. Household savings grew 0.7 percent in 2011 compared with a 12.8 percent pace in 2010, according to the National Economic and Social Development Board. About 45 percent of Thai households, or 9.09 million people, can’t save because their expenses and debt exceed their incomes, according to NESDB. “We have to monitor household debts closely because they continue to rise and our savings rate is very low,” said Suwannee Khamman, deputy secretary-general of the NESDB. While Chitwalai said she’s relieved to finally have her own car to drive to work in, for some first-time buyers, the euphoria has faded with the pressure of monthly payments. “It would have been wiser for me to wait longer and save more money to buy a car,” said Sureephon Withitkul, a 24-year- old officer at Federal Express Corp. She bought a car under the rebate program last year and now spends half her monthly salary on installments. “It’s difficult to make ends meet.” To contact the reporter on this story: Suttinee Yuvejwattana in Bangkok at suttinee1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephanie Phang at sphang@bloomberg.net",['Suttinee Yuvejwattana'],"Five-Car Families Seen Deterring Thai Rate Cuts: Southeast Asia Chitwalai Srisaengchai bought a car last year to take advantage of a Thai tax rebate and now spends 70 percent of her salary on the loan.

"Foreigners Sell Most Korean Stocks Since May on Yen, Tension",['Saeromi Shin'],2013-04-02 01:16:52,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/global-funds-sell-most-korean-stocks-since-may-on-yen-tensions.html,"International investors sold the most South Korean equities in 10 months in March amid concerns the nation’s exporters will lose market share to Japanese rivals and as tension with North Korea rose. Foreign funds unloaded a net 2.6 trillion won ($2.3 billion) of Kospi index shares last month, the most since May when they dumped 3.7 trillion won, Korea Exchange Inc. data show. Purchases by domestic institutional and retail investors helped the stock gauge to trim its monthly loss to 1.1 percent. The measure lost 0.1 percent at 10:10 a.m. in Seoul today, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index slipped 0.5 percent. Global funds have reduced their holdings of South Korean equities as concerns deepened a weaker yen would give Japanese electronics and car makers an advantage over Korean producers.

The yen weakened to a four-year low against the won on March 8 as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for more monetary easing to end deflation, making the nation’s exporters more competitive versus South Korean rivals. While Japan’s currency has gained 4.9 percent since then, Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group, said last month investors need to watch the won “very carefully” to see if it strengthens versus the yen.

The move was estimated by Barclays Plc in a Feb. 4 report to lead to $9 billion of outflows from Korean stocks in the first quarter. Inflows by local investors are likely to make up for foreign selling toward the second half of this year, Barclays analysts led by Chanik Park wrote in a March 25 note, saying they are turning more “positive” on Korean equities.

Tax Breaks South Korea announced on March 28 it will unveil a stimulus package this month to revive the economy after cutting its growth forecast for the second time in four months. The country said yesterday it will give tax breaks to home buyers and cut borrowing costs as the government seeks to revive home sales that tumbled to the lowest level since 2006. “The expected pump-priming policy from the new government will help support domestic demand,” Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-based fund manager at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management Co., which oversees about $29 billion, said by phone on March 28. “I believe South Korean markets will be able to outperform, catching up with gains in other markets.” To contact the reporter on this story: Saeromi Shin in Seoul at  sshin15@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Darren Boey at  dboey@bloomberg.net",['Saeromi Shin'],"Foreigners Sell Most Korean Stocks Since May on Yen, Tension International investors sold the most South Korean equities in 10 months in March amid concerns the nation’s exporters will lose market share to Japanese rivals and as tension with North Korea rose.

Dollar Ends Five-Week Rally as Economy-Fueled Momentum Fades,['Joseph Ciolli'],2013-03-16 04:00:11,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-16/dollar-ends-five-week-rally-as-economy-fueled-momentum-fades.html,"The dollar halted a five-week rally against the euro that was backed by signals of a strengthening economy, as bullish momentum waned and a report yesterday showed March consumer sentiment trailed forecasts. The 17-nation currency gained versus the greenback as European political chiefs paved the way for a rescue package for Cyprus, boosting optimism regional debt-crisis issues are being addressed. The pound rose even as Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said in a television interview he sees a case for additional central-bank asset purchases. The Federal Reserve begins a two-day meeting March 19 as inflation below the central bank’s target may provide scope to maintain monetary stimulus. “The market had gotten pretty darn long on the dollar since mid-January, based on expectation of U.S. outperformance, rather than risk-on sentiment,” Greg Anderson, New York-based head of Group of 10 currency strategy at Citigroup Inc., said in a telephone interview. “We had a little bit of a positioning squeeze and there was a run on those dollar longs.” A long position is a bet that an asset will increase in value. The dollar depreciated 0.6 percent this week to $1.3067 per euro in New York, touching the weakest level since Dec. 10. The greenback fell 0.8 percent to 95.28 yen. The Japanese currency increased 0.2 percent to 124.58 per euro. Winners, Losers The Australian dollar was the biggest winner among the U.S. currency’s 16 most-traded counterparts this week while Brazil ’s real dropped the most. The yen gained versus the majority of its major peers after touching the weakest level against the dollar since August 2009. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe overcame opposition and saw his nominees to lead the Bank of Japan confirmed by lawmakers, paving the way for expended monetary stimulus to pull Japan out of 15 years of deflation. Japan’s currency has been the worst performer this year among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, depreciating 7.6 percent. The euro gained 1.5 percent, and the dollar increased 2.5 percent. Futures traders increased bets that the yen will decline against the U.S. dollar, figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and other large speculators on a decline in the yen compared with those on an increase -- so- called net shorts -- was 93,763 on March 12, up from 73,351 the week before. Euro Positions Net-short bets that the euro will fall against the dollar decreased to 24,787 as of March 12, compared with 26,116 a week earlier, CFTC figures showed. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe must act to support Cyprus as euro-area officials sought to overcome differences on losses for investors and the role of the International Monetary Fund in a bid to end nine months of bailout talks. Merkel said while euro countries won’t provide assistance “under any conditions,” the currency union needed to prevent Cyprus from lurching toward insolvency. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary U.S. consumer sentiment index for March fell to 71.8, the lowest level since December 2011, from 77.6 in February. The gauge was projected to increase to 78, according to the median estimate of 67 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. U.S. consumer prices increased 2 percent in the 12 months ended in February, after a 1.6 percent year-over-year gain the prior month, a Labor Department report showed yesterday. Fed View “Even as economic indicators improve, I expect the Fed to continue monetary easing and that will weigh on the dollar,” Kengo Suzuki, a currency strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo , said in an interview. “There isn’t inflation concern yet in the U.S.” Sales at U.S. retailers rose 1.1 percent in February, the most in five months and exceeding all projections in a Bloomberg survey, Commerce Department figures showed on March 13. “We’re typically getting better dollar data, but we’re not seeing any follow-through,” Jerry Urwin, director of spot foreign-exchange in New York at Barclays Plc, said yesterday in a telephone interview. “This week has been a frustrating week for the market from a fundamentally based positioning point of view.” The pound rose to a one-week high against the dollar as King said told ITV News March 14 that “markets determine the level of exchange rate, not us.” Pound Trading Sterling has tumbled 3.7 percent against the greenback since the start of last month. In that time, minutes of the Bank of England’s February decision showed King and two other policy makers were defeated in a push for more stimulus and Moody’s Investors Service cut the U.K.’s top credit rating. Australia ’s dollar rose against all 16 of its most-traded counterparts as the statistics bureau said on March 14 the number of people employed rose by 71,500 in February from the previous month, when it increased 13,100. That compared with a 10,000 increase estimated by economists in a Bloomberg survey. The Aussie rose 1.7 percent to $1.0409, after climbing to the strongest level since Feb. 5. The Mexican peso appreciated versus all but one of its 16 main peers after policy makers led by central-bank Governor Agustin Carstens said on March 11 that a rate cut made on March 8 “doesn’t represent the start of a cycle,” bolstering confidence the bank will keep rates on hold.

Volkswagen to Recall Cars in China Over Gearbox Defects,['Bloomberg News'],2013-03-18 10:44:53,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-16/china-orders-recall-of-volkswagen-cars-with-direct-shift-gearbox.html,"Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe ’s largest automaker, plans to recall vehicles in China after drawing scrutiny from the nation’s quality inspector and state broadcaster over defective gearbox systems. The company will conduct a voluntary recall related to its direct-shift gearbox system, Volkswagen said in March 16 statement, without providing details. The statement came after China’s General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said it told the German automaker to conduct a recall, and after Volkswagen was featured in China Central Television’s annual show about anti-consumer practices - - a program that also featured Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co. this year. The Volkswagen case may test China’s recall laws introduced this year, which give the watchdog broader powers to order investigations and impose fines should manufacturers and importers fail to recall faulty products in a timely manner. The nation’s legislature approved plans last week to expand the authority of the food and drug regulator amid growing public discontent over quality and safety. “Any manufacturer, under the new law, should be aware that there’s an increase in the chances that they’ll be ordered to recall,” said Paolo Beconcini, managing partner at Carroll, Burdick & McDonough LLP in Beijing, whose firm advises European and U.S. automakers on product liability and intellectual property issues in China. Recall Estimate As many as 680,000 units sold in China, including Bora, Golf, Passat and Lavida models, might be equipped with the DSG system involved, according to estimates by auto research LMC Automotive. Volkswagen is currently “figuring out the different scenarios,” Christoph Ludewig, a spokesman for the company in Beijing, said in an e-mail today. “We are in touch with AQSIQ and will announce more when we have details.” The company said in May last year that it had sold almost 1 million DSG-equipped vehicles in China. Chinese owners of VW vehicles fitted with the technology -- a system with two gearboxes that help enhance gear changes and improve fuel economy -- have reported abnormal vibrations, loss of power and sudden acceleration, according to CCTV’s report. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker has addressed issues with the system in China since last year. In May, it said its Chinese division agreed to extend the warranty for the automatic transmission technology to 10 years in response to customer complaints. The standard warranty is two years. Driver Feedback Only a “few hundred” of DSG-fitted vehicles had faults that prompted driver feedback, according to a Bloomberg News interview with Harthmuth Hoffmann, a company spokesman, on May 31. Companies operating in China, both domestic and foreign, are increasingly bracing for the annual CCTV show, broadcast every March 15 for World Consumer Rights Day, as the world’s second-biggest economy continues to expand. Last year, France ’s Carrefour SA (CA) shut an outlet in central China after being featured on CCTV. The year before, Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development Co. shares tumbled 10 percent after CCTV reported the company bought pigs that were fed an illegal additive. The broadcast comes as China ushers in new state leadership for the first time in a decade, with Premier Li Keqiang yesterday pledging to improve consumer safety by tackling food problems and the environment with an “iron fist.” Gearbox Problems In its March 16 statement, the Chinese quality watchdog didn’t say how many Volkswagen vehicles would be involved in the recall and calls to its news department seeking comment went unanswered over the weekend. The regulator said it will compel the automaker to call back the vehicles if it doesn’t comply. In its March 15 program, CCTV also investigated alleged flaws in the after-sales service of Cupertino, California-based Apple. Carolyn Wu, the company’s spokeswoman in Beijing, said the company has established a network of more than 500 authorized service centers in 270 cities across China to provide “unmatched” support to owners of its devices. “Apple is dedicated to making the best products in the world and delivering unmatched customer service everywhere we do business,” Wu said in a phone interview today. “Our team is always striving to exceed our customers’ expectations, and we take any customer concerns very seriously.” Apple Sales Apple slipped to sixth place from fourth in China’s smartphone market in the third quarter of 2012. Samsung leads the China smartphone market in share, and four domestic suppliers also now outsell the iPhone in the nation, according to market researcher IDC. Even so, Apple’s sales in China in its fiscal first quarter climbed 67 percent from a year earlier to $6.83 billion, the company said in January. CCTV said in its broadcast that Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co. sold cars with rusted chassis. The company said in a statement on its website on March 16 that a “lack of experience” resulted in the failure to ensure the body structure was properly painted to put off rust. The company said it has fixed the rust issue of 6,579 affected vehicles and will work with the quality regulator to issue a recall. The consumer program also reported on impure gold made in a workshop in Shenzhen and sold in shops in Tianjin and Hebei, and on some Chinese medical companies, including one in Henan province, who hired actors to masquerade as doctors to promote products. CCTV also investigated the use of substandard concrete by some developers in the southern city of Shenzhen who used low- quality sea sand instead of river sand. The Shenzhen Housing and Construction Bureau found 31 concrete-mixing plants violated industry rules, according to a statement posted on its website on March 16.

Farmer’s Daughter Haugerud Reaps Riches on Drought-Struck Corn,['Kambiz Foroohar'],2012-09-19 04:00:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/farmer-s-daughter-haugerud-reaps-riches-on-drought-struck-corn.html,"For three excruciating weeks in May, Renee Haugerud, the founder of New York hedge fund Galtere Ltd., agonized that her wager on corn was a massive mistake. She had started buying in March, when futures contracts averaged about $5.59 a bushel, expecting steady to rising demand from ethanol refiners and feedlots to boost prices. Instead, on May 10, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported record planting and forecast a bumper crop. Prices began a 12 percent slide for the month. Other hedge funds bailed. Haugerud, 57, the daughter of a part-time farmer, fought the temptation to join the crowd, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its October issue. Instead, she and her team got to work. They rechecked past corn yields and plowed through ethanol production and export numbers to reconfirm their calculation of strong demand for a so-so crop. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency bolstered their case in April when it raised the limit for ethanol in gasoline to 15 percent from 10 percent for cars made after 2001, later aiding the buying Haugerud had forecast. As for supply, Haugerud thought the USDA was overoptimistic in its harvest prediction. If farmers were planting in amounts not seen since 1937, her farm upbringing and commodities experience told her they were tapping marginal land. This all didn’t add up to a corn bonanza. “Our research said that, at best, we were going to get an average yield,” she says. “The market was pricing in perfection.” ‘Tire Kicker’ For a gut check, at month’s end, Haugerud flew to the firm’s research farm in southern Minnesota , near where she had grown up. As she scooped a handful of dirt, her confidence in her corn bet swelled. The dry soil crumbled. And the stalks were less than knee-high, with some well below average at 6 inches (15 centimeters). Her analyst, swinging through Iowa , Illinois and Indiana, reported that farmers were complaining about heat -- a sign of impending drought. “I was shocked how short the crop was,” Haugerud recalls in her corner office in the Scribner Building on Fifth Avenue, where, when not touring fields and mines, she’s chief investment officer overseeing five analysts and traders. “I’m a tire kicker, not a screen watcher.” ‘Knock on Wood’ Haugerud is using her crop smarts to trounce rivals. Thirty-two states, from South Carolina to Nevada , have baked in the worst drought since 1956 during a year that toppled the 117- year-old U.S. heat record. Corn contracts hit $8.1775 a bushel on July 30, more than $2.50 above March levels. Haugerud, who sold her futures position that day, says grains and soybeans will keep up the momentum. Farmers are expected to harvest 10.7 billion bushels of corn, the smallest crop in six years, the USDA said in September. Soybeans have gained 37 percent this year through mid-September, the most among the 24 commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index. “The second half of 2012 is going to be fantastic,” Haugerud says, adding that Galtere still holds options to gain from corn prices. “I better knock on wood,” she adds, jumping up to tap her desk. “I’ve had a breakout year every five to 10 years, and my last one was in 2002. I’d better knock on wood again.” Haugerud has good reasons not to tempt fate. After a disastrous 2011 that saw her Galtere International Master Fund fall 10.4 percent, her corn bet is yielding profits. Galtere gained 5.3 percent in July, more than double the 2 percent for the Newedge Commodity Trading Index, which monitors hedge funds that trade in agricultural and other commodities. The fund was up 0.5 percent in August. 11 Percent The fund’s returns have averaged 11 percent a year since 1999, topping 4.9 percent for the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index compiled by Hedge Fund Research Inc. Through the end of August, Galtere is up 9.3 percent in 2012. Although Galtere invests in equity, bond and currency markets , commodities underpin Haugerud’s decisions. “We have a commodity lens through which we view every trade,” she says. Last year, she shorted Chile’s peso when she thought copper was heading lower. Copper futures fell 20 percent in the second half. Haugerud is unique in the world of commodities-focused hedge funds -- a woman from a Midwestern farm whose $600 million hedge fund is beating some of Wall Street’s top players. Female managers oversee just 3 percent of the $2 trillion in hedge-fund assets, according to HFR. Tricky Business Commodities have proved a tricky business in the past 18 months. Concerns over China’s growth, Europe ’s economy and Iran’s nuclear ambitions have made predicting price swings tougher. Clive Capital LLP, a $3.3 billion London hedge fund that invests in oil, currencies and farm commodities, lost 3 percent in July. Fortress Investment Group LLC said in May it would close its $500 million commodities fund after shedding almost 13 percent in four months amid bets on oil and metals. BlueGold Capital Management LLP, which soared 200 percent in 2008 on rising oil prices, closed in April after tumbling 34 percent last year. “Fundamental analysis doesn’t always work because of the political environment,” says Marcus Storr, head of hedge funds at Bad Homburg , Germany-based Feri Trust GmbH, which manages about $20 billion. ‘Deep Homework’ Arpad Busson, chairman of EIM SA, a fund-of-funds firm in Nyon, Switzerland, says Haugerud’s 30 years of trading commodities and currencies help her overcome setbacks. “She has strong stamina and does deep homework,” says Busson, who met Haugerud in the mid-1990s and invests with her. “She has the kind of experience in commodities that very few people have.” Haugerud says commodities, especially agricultural products, will outperform stocks and bonds during the next two decades. In today’s economic climate, which she calls “inverse stagflation,” interest rates are low and money is plentiful, yet growth is anemic. Commodity prices had tripled as of the end of July since 1982, while stocks had soared 11-fold. Now, she predicts commodities and real assets like farmland will appreciate while stocks and bonds stagnate. Corporations won’t be able to pass rising costs to consumers, which will hurt share prices. ‘Regime Change’ So far, she has been right. For the five years ended in August, the commodities benchmark S&P GSCI Spot Index climbed 36 percent compared with a 4.6 percent drop for the S&P 500. “This is a regime change from the dominance of stocks and bonds,” she says. Farm prices will jump further as genetic engineering, irrigation and fertilizers fail to replenish overused land. “Productivity in yield enhancement is coming to an end,” she says. In the U.S., fewer young people are taking up the plow just as Brazil , Turkey and Indonesia consume more food. “That will put pressure on agricultural prices,” she says. Haugerud grew up amid the farms and forests of Fillmore County, Minnesota , rising before dawn to feed the cattle. Her father, Neil, was sheriff, and their home doubled as the jail. Young Renee helped serve breakfast to the prisoners in the rear of the house. When she was 5, her dad took her in a single-engine plane to check cornfields, explaining how investors could sell corn on a futures exchange without actually owning it. “I was mesmerized,” she recalls. ’Pragmatic Simplicity’ Haugerud headed to the University of Montana , Missoula, for a forestry degree. After graduation in 1980, she became a trader at Minnesota commodities giant Cargill Inc. Genesis Capital Fund LP, a hedge fund based in Fairfield, Iowa, headhunted her in 1993 to run proprietary trading. She moved to Hong Kong two years later with the U.K.’s NatWest Markets Ltd. Longing for her own company, she put up $5 million in 1997 to found Galtere, a name she invented to convey “pragmatic simplicity.” Galtere climbed 61 percent in 2002, Haugerud’s breakout year. Gold futures rose 25 percent, and she shorted the S&P 500, which fell 24 percent. The company, however, had only $12 million in assets and couldn’t attract investors. “There is a subliminal feeling, which I don’t agree with, that women won’t lose you money but won’t be able to make you big money,” she says. Haugerud approached Cargill’s hedge fund, Black River Asset Management LLC, run by former boss Gary Jarrett. Cargill invested $60 million, and Black River took a 49 percent stake in 2003. ‘Ka-ching, Ka-ching’ “The minute Cargill said they’d invested in me, ka-ching, ka-ching, and the money started pouring in,” she says. When Black River offered to buy the rest, Haugerud and investors instead bought back Black River’s stake. “She’s very entrepreneurial and didn’t want to work in a corporate environment,” Jarrett says. Galtere’s assets soared to $2.4 billion before Haugerud suffered through three down years. The flagship fund fell 1.7 percent in 2008 and 0.1 percent in 2009. In 2011, her wager on resource-rich nations backfired. In one instance, Haugerud bought the Brazilian real and Mexican peso and sold the dollar, calculating that those nations would grow faster than the U.S. Instead, Greek debt buffeted Europe, the dollar rose and commodities fell. “We got the big picture wrong,” Haugerud says. Her strategy to manage risk forced her to close trades after 2 percent losses. “Even though I traded for 30 years, it depressed me,” she says. Art, Science Haugerud’s second fund, Galtere Ultra, convinced her to keep going. Ultra makes the same bets as the flagship but tolerates more risks. As of the end of July, the fund was up 43 percent since its inception in October 2008. “There’s a science of trading and an art of trading,” she says. “The science of trading ponders the past; the art of trading focuses on the future. In a good hedge fund, you need both.” That’s the message Haugerud wants to instill at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga’s College of Business. She and her husband, John Murphy , a retired Axa SA executive and university alumnus, have a home in the city and donated $2 million to the school. Of that sum, $1.5 million went to start the Galtere Institute, which aims to imbue finance with a female perspective via courses such as the neuroscience of trading. “One goal of the program is to give women access to trading, which can make them a lot of money,” Haugerud says. “I believe in women getting their fair share.” As Haugerud interviewed candidates to head the center in July, she kept an eye on grain estimates and weather patterns. In the fall, she’ll visit Minnesota to check on crops again, before heading to silver mines in Mexico and coffee fields in Brazil -- trying to spot any signs that could derail her prediction for a profitable second half.

Lithium Boom Spurs Production From Brine: Commodities,['Lydia Mulvany' 'Jack Kaskey'],2012-09-21 16:56:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/lithium-boom-spurs-production-from-california-brine-commodities.html,"Lithium demand, seen doubling in the next eight years on sales of batteries used in electric vehicles, is spurring a U.S. company to build a factory to extract the metal from brine in California. Simbol Materials LLC ’s proposed Imperial Valley plant near the Mexican border would slash the time and cost needed to extract lithium from salty water, Chief Executive Officer Luka Erceg said in an interview. The closely held, Pleasanton, California-based company may boost output from an initial 8,000 tons a year to as much as 64,000 tons by the end of the decade, Erceg said, equal to 21 percent of projected global demand. Simbol is among prospective lithium producers that are trying to break into a market dominated by four companies including Princeton, New Jersey-based Rockwood Holdings Inc. (ROC) The price of the lightest metal, used to make long-lasting batteries for laptops, power tools and now electric vehicles, jumped 35 percent in 18 months, according to Jonathan Lee, an analyst at Byron Capital Markets in Toronto. “Electric cars are eventually going to become a bigger part of auto sales, and given that they require hundreds of times the amount of lithium needed for laptops, that’s going to really increase demand,” Chris L. Shaw, a New York-based analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co., said yesterday in a telephone interview. Hybrid Demand Global demand will double to 300,000 tons by 2020, according analysts at Dahlman Rose & Co. Sales of 1 million electric vehicles a year would more than double battery-grade lithium use which is currently 40 million pounds (18,144 tons), Rockwood Chief Executive Officer Seifi Ghasemi said Sept. 11 in a presentation. Each electric vehicle uses about 50 pounds of lithium and hybrids each use about 20 pounds, compared with about 0.1 ounce for a mobile phone and about 1 ounce for an iPad, Ghasemi said. About 40,000 electric vehicles and hybrid plug-ins were sold globally last year, according to the EV City Casebook , a report published on the International Energy Association’s website. By 2020 there will be annual sales 3.9 million hybrid vehicles, 1.4 million plug-in hybrids and 2.8 million fully electric plug-in vehicles, Erceg said. While lithium is mined from ore, brine evaporation is the lowest-cost source. Simbol’s technology takes brine from geothermal power plants and extracts minerals via a so-called reverse osmosis filtration system in a process that takes 90 minutes to 2 hours. Conventional methods using evaporation can take 18 months, Erceg says. Evaporation Process Brian Jaskula, a mineral commodity specialist for the U.S. Geological Survey , said Simbol’s method could be a breakthrough. “If they can eliminate the evaporation process, they can produce at a much lower price point, which would be great for the industry,” he said. Toronto-born Erceg, 41, has a master’s in business administration degree from Rice University in Houston and a law degree from South Texas College of Law. He worked at El Paso LLC, CenterPoint Energy Inc. and Philip Services Corp. for 15 years before co-founding Simbol. The company’s other founders are Carol J. Bruton and Brian R. Viani, who previously worked at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and M. Scott Conley. The four are shareholders in Simbol, alongside Itochu Corp., Firelake Capital Management LLC and Mohr Davidow Ventures. Erceg said he expects construction on the first California plant to begin at the start of 2013. He declined to disclose the cost of the project. Quebec Mine “Our intent is to build multiple products and multiple plants concentrated in one region,” he said. Other companies are also planning more lithium capacity. Canada Lithium Corp. expects to start mining 20,000 tons annually in Quebec next year, said Olav Svela, a company spokesman. Perth, Australia-based Galaxy Resources Ltd., which started mining in 2010 and processing at a Chinese plant in April, is developing a lithium and potash project in Argentina. Rockwood, in addition to its own expansion plans, agreed last month to acquire Australian lithium miner Talison Lithium Ltd. for about C$724 million ($743 million). Rockwood, Talison, Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile SA and FMC Corp. (FMC) control about 90 percent of the global market, analysts at Jefferies & Co. said in a report in June. Rockwood has about 50 percent of the $900 million market for lithium, excluding Talison, Ghasemi said in his presentation. Rising demand allowed Rockwood to raise prices for lithium carbonate , the processed form of the material that’s used in lithium-ion batteries , by 20 percent in July 2011 and another 22 percent a year later, Ghasemi said. ‘Berserk’ Industry Whether Simbol and other companies planning to enter the market will break the dominance of the largest four producers depends on whether they execute their business plans and disregard price to focus on gaining market share, John McNulty, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG who has a buy rating on Rockwood, said in an interview. Erceg says high prices are unsustainable in the long term and that companies like Simbol using new technology will cut production costs. There are 23 new projects and expansions for lithium, which could turn a tight market into an oversupplied one, said Keith Evans, a retired geologist who worked in the lithium business for three decades. The industry has gone “berserk” with new projects since a report six years ago anticipated a shortage, and if all the companies produce as planned, global output will climb to as much as 642,000 tons a year by 2020, Evans said. Complex Product “Some of the new projects are quite good, but there’s no room for them at the moment,” Evans said in a telephone interview from San Diego. “They’ll just have to exercise patience and hope the demand after 2020 will increase dramatically.” Erceg says he’s not concerned about oversupply of lithium. He says that in 2009, he counted 72 companies talking about getting into the lithium industry, while now there are probably five -- including Simbol -- who have a chance of doing so. “Most companies, we don’t think they’re going to get there,” he said. “Lithium is not a smile-and-dial product, it’s a complex product.” To contact the reporters on this story: Lydia Mulvany in New York at  lmulvany1@bloomberg.net ; Jack Kaskey in Houston at  jkaskey@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Simon Casey at  scasey4@bloomberg.net",['Lydia MulvanyJack Kaskey'],"Lithium Boom Spurs Production From Brine: Commodities Lithium demand, seen doubling in the next eight years on sales of batteries used in electric vehicles, is spurring a U.S. company to build a factory to extract the metal from brine in California.

Rising demand allowed Rockwood to raise prices for lithium carbonate , the processed form of the material that’s used in lithium-ion batteries , by 20 percent in July 2011 and another 22 percent a year later, Ghasemi said. ‘Berserk’ Industry Whether Simbol and other companies planning to enter the market will break the dominance of the largest four producers depends on whether they execute their business plans and disregard price to focus on gaining market share, John McNulty, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG who has a buy rating on Rockwood, said in an interview. Erceg says high prices are unsustainable in the long term and that companies like Simbol using new technology will cut production costs. There are 23 new projects and expansions for lithium, which could turn a tight market into an oversupplied one, said Keith Evans, a retired geologist who worked in the lithium business for three decades. The industry has gone “berserk” with new projects since a report six years ago anticipated a shortage, and if all the companies produce as planned, global output will climb to as much as 642,000 tons a year by 2020, Evans said. Complex Product “Some of the new projects are quite good, but there’s no room for them at the moment,” Evans said in a telephone interview from San Diego. “They’ll just have to exercise patience and hope the demand after 2020 will increase dramatically.” Erceg says he’s not concerned about oversupply of lithium. He says that in 2009, he counted 72 companies talking about getting into the lithium industry, while now there are probably five -- including Simbol -- who have a chance of doing so. “Most companies, we don’t think they’re going to get there,” he said. “Lithium is not a smile-and-dial product, it’s a complex product.” To contact the reporters on this story: Lydia Mulvany in New York at  lmulvany1@bloomberg.net ; Jack Kaskey in Houston at  jkaskey@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Simon Casey at  scasey4@bloomberg.net",6514,1058,-1
Peugeot Heirs Invest in Nursing Homes as Automaker Slides,['Mathieu Rosemain'],2012-09-20 07:41:05,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/peugeot-heirs-invest-in-nursing-homes-as-automaker-slides.html,"As PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) uses up 200 million euros ($260 million) in cash every month, the family that founded the French automaker and can determine its fate is getting better returns from alternative investments -- like nursing homes. The acquisition of 7 percent of Orpea, which operates assisted-living facilities, is part of a diversification strategy in the last decade that has reduced the automaker’s share of assets in the family’s listed holding company to 35 percent from more than 90 percent in 2000. Signs that the family is wavering in its commitment complicates Peugeot’s efforts to reverse deepening losses that pushed its shares this year to a 23-year low. The shift coincides with clashes between the family over its role at the carmaker, including Thierry Peugeot blocking his cousin Robert’s effort to take an executive post at the automaker in 2006, two people familiar with the matter said. “As the number of descendants keeps growing, some of the younger ones may become less involved in the car business and may be tempted to leave the ship if it isn’t profitable enough,” said Bernard Jullien, an industrial economist with French automotive think-tank Gerpisa. “Peugeot managers are not given enough leeway to lead the company.” Peugeot, Europe ’s second-largest carmaker after Volkswagen AG (VOW) , lost 662 million euros ($860 million) at its automotive operations in the first half. Slow to expand outside Europe, Peugeot’s home region accounted for 76 percent of revenue last year, compared with 65 percent at VW. Gefco Sale To bolster its balance sheet, the manufacturer this year issued 1 billion euros in new shares and sold assets including its 48-year-old Paris headquarters. The company today agreed to sell a 75 percent stake in its Gefco trucking unit to OAO Russian Railways for 800 million euros and a special dividend of 100 million euros. The company was lowered to three levels below investment grade by Fitch Ratings yesterday. Having rebuffed previous partnership offers, Peugeot agreed in February to cooperate with General Motors Co. (GM) , making the American automaker the second-largest shareholder. As the European auto industry descends on Peugeot’s home town next week with the start of the Paris Motor Show, the company will be dropped from France ’s benchmark CAC 40 (CAC) index on Sept. 24. With the automaker faltering, Robert Peugeot has focused on running the family’s FFP holding company, still the carmaker’s biggest shareholder, and has diversified assets with purchases such as the Orpea stake, household appliance maker Groupe SEB and marketing services company DKSH. Family Holdings The holding company has benefited from those moves. FFP’s stock, traded in Paris, is off by just 3.3 percent this year, with holdings like Orpea (ORP) , which has gained 22 percent, offsetting the 35 percent decline in the shares of the automaker. Peugeot fell as much as 1.6 percent in Paris trading today, and was 0.4 percent lower as of 9:38 a.m. local time. The Peugeot family currently owns 25.4 percent of the company’s shares through FFP and Etablissements Peugeot Freres, another holding company that in turn controls FFP. All told, the family controls 38.1 percent of Peugeot’s voting rights, which means they can block decisions requiring shareholder approval. And five family members are on Peugeot’s 14-seat supervisory board. Thierry Peugeot, the carmaker’s chairman, declined to comment for this story. At an event this month at Peugeot’s Sochaux factory, the company’s oldest and largest assembly plant, he walked away when asked about the role of the family in the company. “Me, I don’t exist,” he said. Robert Peugeot didn’t respond to requests for an interview. In comments to French newspaper Le Figaro in March, he said FFP (FFP) planned to ensure its stability, while at the same time retaining its role as Peugeot’s anchor shareholder. Lack of Leadership Those aims may require further diversification beyond the minority stakes it holds in 10 other companies and the investments made with private equity firms. FFP reported a first-half net loss of 66 million euros as profits elsewhere only partially offset FFP’s 156 million-euro burden from Peugeot’s losses. The family hasn’t had clear leadership in 10 years, said Jean-Louis Loubet, a professor at the University of Evry-Val d’Essonne and author of a book on the Peugeot dynasty. “The decision-making process used to be centralized in the hands of Pierre Peugeot, the family’s strongman,” Loubet said in an interview. “Since his death in 2002, the family governance has become more collaborative.” Divergent Interests The family’s divergent views were evident when Robert Peugeot sought a front-line role after Jean-Martin Folz stepped down as chief executive officer in 2006. Thierry blocked the move, arguing that tradition was to choose outside CEOs, said two people who asked not to be identified because they wanted to maintain good relations with the family. Since then, Peugeot has had two CEOs, neither with auto industry experience. Christian Streiff, a former Airbus executive, lasted just over two years. Current CEO Philippe Varin is the former head of steelmaker Corus Group Ltd. The backing of a stable, long-term shareholder can be a key support in the auto industry, where cars require years of development. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) was saved from collapse in the 1960s after Herbert Quandt backed development of new models, allowing it to fend off a takeover bid from the parent of Mercedes-Benz. The Quandt family, BMW’s largest shareholder, still supports the luxury-car maker. For decades, VW has been backed by its home state of Lower Saxony , which can block major strategy decisions. Incomplete Alliances Renault SA (RNO) , which is 15 percent-owned by the French government, expanded outside Europe by partnering with Japan ’s Nissan Motor Co. (7201) in 1999. The alliance has continued to push into growth markets and agreed this year to buy 74.5 percent of Russia ’s dominant carmaker OAO AvtoVAZ. (AVAZ) Renault posted a first- half operating profit of 482 million euros. Peugeot’s efforts to secure partners have been less successful. A joint venture with BMW to develop electric powertrains and components broke down in July, and talks with Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211) about an alliance were called off in 2010 because of financing concerns. The February agreement with GM to cooperate on purchasing and vehicle development in Europe has yet to yield concrete results. The Detroit carmaker said in August that it may write down the value of its 7 percent stake in Peugeot that was part of the deal. Given Peugeot’s woes and the family’s divided interests, there may be little chance that the founder’s heirs will refocus on the carmaker. “FFP’s other investments have done well so far,” said Florent Couvreur, an analyst at CM-CIC Securities. “It now looks more like an investment fund than a family holding.” To contact the reporter on this story: Mathieu Rosemain in Paris at  mrosemain@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at  cthomas16@bloomberg.net",['Mathieu Rosemain'],"Peugeot Heirs Invest in Nursing Homes as Automaker Slides As PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) uses up 200 million euros ($260 million) in cash every month, the family that founded the French automaker and can determine its fate is getting better returns from alternative investments -- like nursing homes.

"China Must Move Past Japan’s War-Inflicted Wounds, Panetta Says",['Gopal Ratnam'],2012-09-19 08:56:31,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/china-must-move-past-japan-s-war-inflicted-wounds-panetta-says.html,"China must move beyond the “deep wounds” caused by Japan during World War II in addressing present-day issues such as the dispute over contested islands in the East China Sea , U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said. Panetta, speaking to military cadets in Beijing today after meeting with Vice President Xi Jinping, also said that the U.S. had urged its Japanese allies to resolve territorial issues with China peacefully. “I understand the deep wounds that China suffered during World War II and nobody understands those wounds better than the U.S., because the U.S. also suffered deep wounds” during the conflict, Panetta said. “At the same time we can’t live in the past, we must live in the future.” The standoff over control of the islands, known as Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese, has sparked the worst bilateral crisis since 2005, endangering a trade relationship that has tripled in the past decade to more than $340 billion. It also comes ahead of a once-a-decade leadership change this year in China that has already been clouded by a recent two-week absence by Xi Jinping , who is in line to be president, and the ouster of Politburo member Bo Xilai. More than a hundred police stood watch today over streets free of protesters outside the Japanese embassy in Beijing. Thousands of people yesterday waved flags and brandished portraits of Mao Zedong in demonstrations at the embassy as well as at the Japanese consulate in Shanghai. ‘Keep Walking’ The road in front of the Japanese embassy in the capital was reopened to traffic today after having been shut since at least Sept. 15 because of protests. Military police wearing helmets stood guarding the embassy gates and policemen standing on the sidewalk instructed those passing by to “keep walking along.” “They do not want things to get out of control,” Joseph Cheng , a political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong , said yesterday. “There will be more attempts to contain the protests.” Panetta said the Japan-U.S. alliance shouldn’t be viewed by China as American support for the Japanese point of view on the island dispute, likening the U.S. stance to its alliance with Israel. “We’ve made clear to Israel that it’s not the right time to strike Iran ,” he said. “We have made it clear to Japan’s leaders that they’ve a responsibility to resolve this dispute peacefully.” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei said at a regular briefing in Beijing today that the U.S. should “maintain its neutrality” in the island dispute. Ambassador’s Car Demonstrators in the capital yesterday caused minor damage to the official vehicle of U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke as it was about to enter the embassy grounds, spokesman Nolan Barkhouse said today. Some of the people had Chinese flags and looked to be leaving protests taking place at the nearby Japanese embassy, said a U.S. official who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Locke was in the car at the time, the official said. Japanese retailers in China have closed their doors and covered up their logos as protests spread to dozens of cities. The tensions complicate efforts to fortify growth in each country as Europe ’s debt crisis saps demand for exports. At the Japanese embassy in Beijing yesterday, protesters threw bottles and branches at the building’s walls, which were spattered with eggs and paint. In Shanghai, protesters marched through the streets waving Chinese flags and shouting slogans saying “Down With the Japanese.” The recent demonstrations escalated after Japan last week purchased the islands from a private Japanese owner. The islands have been under Japanese administrative control since 1895. Keep Cool “Sino-Japan relations are often described as hot in trade but cold in politics, but now even the trade relationship is getting cold,” said Zhang Jifeng, a researcher with the Institute of Japanese Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. “It’s hard to tell which side would suffer more from the cooling trade, but it’s sure that the pain will be deep for both.” Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Sony Corp. (6758) and Fast Retailing Co. (9983) were among companies that halted operations in China after protesters attacked Japanese cars and shops. “If our relationship remains strained for a long period, it will be harmful not only to our two countries but to the region and the world economy,” Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on TBS Television. “We should keep a cool head, but take a firm line. It is important to at least talk, exchange information and communicate.” Boats Sail Japan “totally caused” the current crisis and should “take responsibility,” Chinese Defense Minister Liang Guanglie told reporters in Beijing yesterday in a joint appearance with Panetta. “We will very closely watch the evolution with regards to this dispute and we reserve the right for further actions.” A Chinese fishing ban in waters surrounding the islands ended Sept. 16, and Chinese and Japanese media aired footage of fishing vessels heading out to sea. The state-run China News Service reported on Sept. 17 that 1,000 fishing boats typically go to the region and the government would send more vessels than in recent years. Hong Kong-based activists may go to the region as early as today, the Apple Daily newspaper reported. Xi met with Panetta at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing today, his first announced appearance with a foreign visitor after being absent in public for about two weeks. Panetta and Xi met in a ceremonial room at the Great Hall, which overlooks Tiananmen Square and is used for hosting state visits and for sessions of China ’s legislature. Wearing a dark blue suit and a light blue tie, Xi appeared healthy and shook hands with Panetta before greeting other U.S. officials.

Motor City Revival Means 14-Fold Return for Home Bet,['Kathleen M.Howley' 'Jeff Green'],2012-09-19 13:47:44,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/detroit-mortgage-column.html,"A two-story brick house in Detroit sold for $47,214 last month, two years after U.S. Bank seized it in a foreclosure. For the home, with blue-striped awnings and white shutters, it was the fourth owner since December, when investor Buy Right Properties LLC purchased it for $3,383. Real estate values in some Detroit neighborhoods are surging as the state’s automobile industry recuperates and investors flip bank-seized properties. Home prices gained 7.2 percent in July from a year earlier, the city’s biggest jump in more than a dozen years, according to mortgage-data firm FNC Inc. In comparison, an index of prices in the nation’s largest 100 cities increased 0.6 percent in the same period. “The combination of the auto industry comeback and the home market hitting bottom is pretty powerful,” said Robert Dorsey, FNC’s chief data officer, from his office in Oxford, Mississippi. “They’ve been going to round-the-clock shifts in some of the auto plants, and that translates into housing demand for a city that was as low as you can go.” Private-equity firms and other investors are snapping up foreclosed homes, helping to buoy prices in areas where values plunged during the recession, such as Southern California , Arizona and Florida. The hardest-hit regions are leading a nationwide housing recovery being fueled by a tight supply of homes and Federal Reserve efforts to keep mortgage rates low. Auto Market In Detroit, there’s the added element of the resurrected auto market. Ford Motor Co. (F) plants in Dearborn and Wayne, Michigan , near Detroit are operating overnight with rotating crews of workers, along with plants such as Chrysler Group LLC’s Warren, Michigan, metal-stamping factory, which run 24 hours a day. A Jeep plant in Detroit will add a third shift in November, with the U.S. auto industry heading for its strongest year since 2007. As recently as 2009, the automakers had ceased round-the- clock assembly after the worst recession since the Great Depression helped contribute to the bankruptcies of Chrysler and the predecessor to General Motors Co. (GM)  Home sales in the metropolitan Detroit area jumped 11 percent in August compared to a year earlier, according to Realcomp II Ltd., a Farmington Hills, Michigan, multiple-listing service operator. The inventory of properties on the market in August fell 16.1 percent to 26,404. Foreclosures comprised 11.8 percent of the market and short sales made up 21.3 percent. The housing recovery isn’t uniform, said Mike Shannon, a real estate broker in Dearborn, Michigan, who specializes in selling bank-owned properties in Detroit. Three out of 10 homes in the city are vacant, according to the Census Bureau. Almost half of properties are valued at $50,000 or less. Home Shortage “Detroit has a shortage of homes in good areas, and when one of those properties comes on the market, it usually goes in a day or two,” Shannon said. “Prices are going up neighborhood to neighborhood -- it’s not an across-the-board thing.” Hedge funds and private equity companies, which have been buying foreclosed homes in other parts of the U.S., have largely bypassed Detroit, said Randolph Barker, a director on the Detroit Association of Realtors. In Motor City, as Detroit is known for its concentration of automakers and parts suppliers, smaller investors have dominated the market, he said. “Detroit has a reputation that scared away a lot of big institutional investors because the market fell so far,” said Barker. The city is still reeling from a decades-long decline that since 2000 has shrunk its population by 25 percent. In April, it narrowly averted state takeover because of its budget deficit and $12 billion in long-term debt. The city is now under watch of an advisory board as part of an agreement with the state to prevent it from seeking bankruptcy. Cheapest Market The average home price in the city was $20,322 in July, according to the Michigan Association of Realtors, making it the cheapest urban market in the country. For all of Wayne County, including the higher-end neighborhoods of Grosse Pointe and Grosse Point Park, the average price was $108,616, according to the group. For the home with the blue striped awnings in city’s Conant Gardens neighborhood, the ownership trail starts with Buy Right Properties, which purchased it in December. MJ Income Property LLC paid $21,500 in March, followed by F Market Straights LLC, which bought it for $27,000 a few days later, according to the deeds. A private buyer purchased it on Aug. 17, the county records show. Home values in the state have stabilized as Michigan added 29,300 jobs at auto-assembly plants and factories that supply parts after GM emerged from a government-backed bankruptcy in July 2009, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor , Michigan. Resurgent Riverfront GM, the largest U.S. automaker, has its multitower world headquarters on Detroit’s resurgent riverfront. Ford Motor Co. is based in Dearborn, Michigan, 9 miles (14 kilometers) away. Chrysler Group LLC is headquartered in Auburn Hills , another Detroit suburb to the north. U.S. auto sales rose 19.9 percent in August, exceeding analysts’ estimates, and are on pace to exceed 14 million vehicles for the best year since 2007. Chrysler’s sales last month increased 14 percent, GM sales were up 10 and Ford rose 13 percent, according to Autodata Corp., which tracks auto sales. Michigan has had the fastest-improving economy in the U.S., after energy-rich North Dakota , from the third quarter of 2009 through the first quarter of this year, according to the Bloomberg Economic Evaluation of States, which tabulates economic recovery from employment and home values to performance of public companies. Michigan’s unemployment rate of 9 percent is down from 14.2 percent in August 2009. Neighborhoods Gaining Neighborhoods in the region where prices are gaining include Indian Village, the Boston-Edison area and Palmer Woods, where Republican Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney grew up. A home his father owned on Balmoral Drive was torn down two years ago after it fell into foreclosure. For some Detroit neighborhoods, the improvement in the market has come too late. Areas like Brightmoor and Delray have acres of dilapidated houses, their doors standing open after vandals stripped the structures of furnaces, water heaters, kitchen cabinets and copper pipes, said Shannon. “We have wide open plains where there used to be tight- knit neighborhoods, and we have other places where you drive two or three blocks and all you see are foreclosures with their doors hanging open and the houses trashed,” Shannon said. Where green fields cover the scars of entire blocks of homes that have been bulldozed, people have proposed plans to use the space as parks and even urban farms, said Barker. “We’ve got a blank slate in some parts of the city, because of bulldozers,” said Barker, the director on the city’s Realtor association. “A much better solution, though, is to have the market firm up and get more of these homes performing on the tax rolls.” To contact the reporters on this story: Kathleen M.

For the home, with blue-striped awnings and white shutters, it was the fourth owner since December, when investor Buy Right Properties LLC purchased it for $3,383. Real estate values in some Detroit neighborhoods are surging as the state’s automobile industry recuperates and investors flip bank-seized properties. Home prices gained 7.2 percent in July from a year earlier, the city’s biggest jump in more than a dozen years, according to mortgage-data firm FNC Inc. In comparison, an index of prices in the nation’s largest 100 cities increased 0.6 percent in the same period. “The combination of the auto industry comeback and the home market hitting bottom is pretty powerful,” said Robert Dorsey, FNC’s chief data officer, from his office in Oxford, Mississippi. “They’ve been going to round-the-clock shifts in some of the auto plants, and that translates into housing demand for a city that was as low as you can go.” Private-equity firms and other investors are snapping up foreclosed homes, helping to buoy prices in areas where values plunged during the recession, such as Southern California , Arizona and Florida. The hardest-hit regions are leading a nationwide housing recovery being fueled by a tight supply of homes and Federal Reserve efforts to keep mortgage rates low. Auto Market In Detroit, there’s the added element of the resurrected auto market. Ford Motor Co. (F) plants in Dearborn and Wayne, Michigan , near Detroit are operating overnight with rotating crews of workers, along with plants such as Chrysler Group LLC’s Warren, Michigan, metal-stamping factory, which run 24 hours a day. A Jeep plant in Detroit will add a third shift in November, with the U.S. auto industry heading for its strongest year since 2007. As recently as 2009, the automakers had ceased round-the- clock assembly after the worst recession since the Great Depression helped contribute to the bankruptcies of Chrysler and the predecessor to General Motors Co. (GM)  Home sales in the metropolitan Detroit area jumped 11 percent in August compared to a year earlier, according to Realcomp II Ltd., a Farmington Hills, Michigan, multiple-listing service operator. The inventory of properties on the market in August fell 16.1 percent to 26,404. Foreclosures comprised 11.8 percent of the market and short sales made up 21.3 percent. The housing recovery isn’t uniform, said Mike Shannon, a real estate broker in Dearborn, Michigan, who specializes in selling bank-owned properties in Detroit. Three out of 10 homes in the city are vacant, according to the Census Bureau. Almost half of properties are valued at $50,000 or less. Home Shortage “Detroit has a shortage of homes in good areas, and when one of those properties comes on the market, it usually goes in a day or two,” Shannon said. “Prices are going up neighborhood to neighborhood -- it’s not an across-the-board thing.” Hedge funds and private equity companies, which have been buying foreclosed homes in other parts of the U.S., have largely bypassed Detroit, said Randolph Barker, a director on the Detroit Association of Realtors. In Motor City, as Detroit is known for its concentration of automakers and parts suppliers, smaller investors have dominated the market, he said. “Detroit has a reputation that scared away a lot of big institutional investors because the market fell so far,” said Barker. The city is still reeling from a decades-long decline that since 2000 has shrunk its population by 25 percent. In April, it narrowly averted state takeover because of its budget deficit and $12 billion in long-term debt. The city is now under watch of an advisory board as part of an agreement with the state to prevent it from seeking bankruptcy. Cheapest Market The average home price in the city was $20,322 in July, according to the Michigan Association of Realtors, making it the cheapest urban market in the country. For all of Wayne County, including the higher-end neighborhoods of Grosse Pointe and Grosse Point Park, the average price was $108,616, according to the group. For the home with the blue striped awnings in city’s Conant Gardens neighborhood, the ownership trail starts with Buy Right Properties, which purchased it in December. MJ Income Property LLC paid $21,500 in March, followed by F Market Straights LLC, which bought it for $27,000 a few days later, according to the deeds. A private buyer purchased it on Aug. 17, the county records show. Home values in the state have stabilized as Michigan added 29,300 jobs at auto-assembly plants and factories that supply parts after GM emerged from a government-backed bankruptcy in July 2009, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor , Michigan. Resurgent Riverfront GM, the largest U.S. automaker, has its multitower world headquarters on Detroit’s resurgent riverfront. Ford Motor Co. is based in Dearborn, Michigan, 9 miles (14 kilometers) away. Chrysler Group LLC is headquartered in Auburn Hills , another Detroit suburb to the north. U.S. auto sales rose 19.9 percent in August, exceeding analysts’ estimates, and are on pace to exceed 14 million vehicles for the best year since 2007. Chrysler’s sales last month increased 14 percent, GM sales were up 10 and Ford rose 13 percent, according to Autodata Corp., which tracks auto sales.

China Foreign Investment Falls as Japan Spat Threatens Trade,['Bloomberg News'],2012-09-19 05:29:10,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/foreign-investment-in-china-fell-in-august-as-economy-slowed-1-.html,"Foreign direct investment in China fell in August for the ninth time in 10 months and the government indicated a diplomatic spat with Japan will hurt trade, adding to restraints on economic growth. Spending declined 1.4 percent from a year earlier to $8.33 billion, the ministry said in Beijing today. Shen Danyang, a ministry spokesman, said at a briefing that the dispute over islands claimed by Japan and China will “definitely” have a negative impact on trade, after protesters attacked Japanese cars and shops across China. China’s economy may grow the least in 22 years this year as Europe ’s debt crisis and slowing U.S. expansion crimp exports, and a property crackdown damps domestic demand. Further weakness may prompt the government to build on interest-rate cuts in June and July and accelerated investment approvals, with Premier Wen Jiabao saying last week that the nation has room for fiscal and monetary measures. “The smaller inflow of foreign investments will exacerbate the nation’s current economic slowdown,” said Joy Yang, chief Greater China economist at Mirae Asset Securities (HK) Ltd., who formerly worked for the International Monetary Fund. China’s leaders, following a political transition set to begin this year, may take further steps to support growth including measures to boost domestic investment and consumption, Yang said. Given the size of foreign investment relative to the economy, the effect on China’s slowdown “will be more in a sentimental rather than material sense,” Yang said. Yuan Shift The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) of stocks rose 0.2 percent at the 11:30 a.m. local-time break. The yuan strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 6.3151 against the U.S. dollar and is down about 0.4 percent this year after a 4.7 percent gain in 2011. Inbound investment in the first eight months of the year fell 3.4 percent to $75 billion, including a drop of about 10 percent in the property market , the ministry said. Outbound spending rose 39 percent to $47.7 billion. China doesn’t want to see the island dispute affect trade, Shen said at the briefing. China was the largest market for Japanese exports in 2011, while Japan was the fourth-largest market for Chinese exports. Japanese investment in China increased 16.2 percent in the first eight months from a year earlier, data showed today, down from a 50 percent rise in 2011. China’s investment in Japan fell 11.1 percent in the January-August period. Currency Sales Net sales of foreign currency by China’s central bank and financial institutions accelerated last month, People’s Bank of China data showed yesterday, suggesting capital outflows picked up as the nation’s economic slowdown deepened. People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said downward pressure on the economy is still “relatively large” and the external environment affecting China’s growth is “grim,” according to a commentary today in Financial News, a newspaper published by the central bank. Even so, officials in China have refrained from easing monetary policy since cutting interest rates and lowering banks’ reserve requirements three times from November to May. Authorities have signaled they won’t enact stimulus near the scale of a 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion at the time) package announced in 2008, amid a global crisis when 20 million migrant workers lost their jobs. Zhou said in the commentary that the central bank will keep the continuity of monetary policies and make more effective and targeted adjustments. Losing Status “China is gradually losing its favorite destination status for foreign investors because of its rising costs and slowing economy,” said Liu Li-Gang, chief Greater China economist in Hong Kong at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., who previously worked at the World Bank. At the same time, “given China’s huge surplus capital and its position to export capital, we do not think this is a worrying sign,” and companies will take advantage of China’s transition to a more consumption-driven society, Liu said. Inflation that accelerated for the first time in five months in August may limit any monetary easing. The government is also persisting with a campaign to rein in speculation in the property market and make housing more affordable. China needs to “moderately lower” interest rates, Li Daokui , a former central bank adviser, told reporters in Tianjin on Sept. 11. Growth will pick up in the fourth quarter and China’s new infrastructure investment plans will aid expansion at the start of next year, he said. Stores Closing Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer, said Sept. 13 it is closing its remaining seven so-called big- box stores in China as it shifts its focus to specialty and online outlets, firing about 850 workers. The slowing economy is helping spark more competition among cities and regions to attract foreign investment. At a fair organized by the Commerce Ministry this month in the coastal city of Xiamen, governments advertised their incentives, including housing subsidies by Xiamen’s Haicang district, special public-security protection from a district in Hubei province and local-tax refunds from an industrial park in Inner Mongolia. “It’s not easy to attract investors, and every region has its own advantages,” Huang Songren, an official from an economic and technology development zone in Zhangzhou, a city in China’s Fujian province, said Sept. 8 from his booth at the fair. --Zhou Xin.

AutoNation Peerless Within U.S. Industry: Riskless Return,['Craig Trudell'],2012-09-19 12:05:49,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/autonation-peerless-within-u-s-industry-riskless-return.html,"AutoNation Inc. (AN) led car dealerships in providing the best way to participate in the U.S. auto industry’s rebound from its bottom three years ago. The BLOOMBERG RISKLESS RETURN RANKING shows AutoNation produced the highest risk-adjusted return among six U.S. dealer groups since September 2009, the year the industry began a climb from the weakest demand for new autos in almost three decades. Car retailers, which are more flexible than assembly lines when cutting costs, outperformed the 24-member Bloomberg Industries North American Auto Parts index and an index of 18 automakers that sell vehicles in the U.S. Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson has said retailers like his can be profitable in good and bad markets because they make money servicing old vehicles and selling to used-car buyers when demand for new autos slips. AutoNation reported its only quarterly loss in the past decade in 2008’s third quarter, when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s failure fueled a credit crunch that dramatically reduced consumers’ ability to borrow money to buy cars. The crisis was “a litmus test, a moment of truth, and if you look at the performance of the automotive retailers during the crisis period, in relative terms it was outstanding,” Jackson, 63, said in a telephone interview from AutoNation’s headquarters in Fort Lauderdale , Florida. “The beauty of our business model is the foundation is service and parts. That covers over 90 percent of our fixed costs.” Lowest Volatility AutoNation had a total return of 127 percent since September 2009, the first month after government incentives for new car buyers that had inflated demand in July and August of that year expired. While AutoNation had the fourth-best total return among dealership groups, it had the lowest volatility at 33, giving it the No. 1 rank by risk-adjusted return. Standard & Poor’s boosted the company to investment-grade last year, and Moody’s Investors Service in November assigned a positive outlook on its rating, the highest speculative-grade level. “We’re able to adjust our cost base very quickly to changes in the marketplace,” Jackson said. “The manufacturer and supplier business model has high fixed costs, is extremely cyclical and not very resilient.” Group 1 Automotive Inc. in Houston had the second-best total return at 131 percent and a volatility of 46, giving it second place in the ranking. Lithia Motors Inc. (LAD) , best by total return with a gain of 164 percent, ranked third, dragged down by the highest volatility in the group, at 60. Beating Suppliers AutoNation, Group 1, Lithia Motors, Asbury Automotive Group Inc. (ABG) , Penske Automotive Group Inc., and Sonic Automotive Inc. combined to post a 3.1 percent risk-adjusted return, topping parts suppliers at 2.2 percent and automakers at 1.05 percent. The ranking is based on a Bloomberg Industries index of automotive dealers and excludes used-car dealers America’s Car- Mart Inc., CarMax Inc. and Copart Inc., as well as AutoCanada Inc., which sells cars in Canada. The risk-adjusted return is calculated by dividing total return by volatility, or the degree of daily price-swing variation, giving a measure of income per unit of risk. The returns aren’t annualized. Higher volatility means an asset’s price can swing dramatically in a short period of time, increasing the prospect for unexpected losses. Lampert, Gates AutoNation benefited from a stable ownership, with Edward Lampert ’s RBS Partners LP hedge fund owning almost 40 percent of the company. The 50-year-old billionaire also personally held 18.6 million shares, a 15 percent stake, as of June 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Cascade Investment LLC, Bill Gates ’s personal money management firm, and his Gates Foundation hold ownership stakes of 13 percent and 2 percent, respectively. AutoNation, the second-largest U.S. stock holding of RBS, has delivered some of the best profits for Lampert, with annual gains of 31 percent since September of 2009. Sears Holding, RBS’s largest U.S. stock position, has languished at 2009 levels, gaining an annual 1.9 percent in the same period. Asbury Automotive provided a risk-adjusted return of 2.7 percent since September 2009. Billionaire Michael Dell ’s MSD Capital LP holds a 10.5 percent stake in Duluth, Georgia-based Asbury, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ‘Richest Guy’ Michael Larson , chief investment officer of Cascade Investment in Kirkland, Washington , and Todd Fogarty, a spokesman for MSD Capital, declined to comment for this story. A spokesmen for Lampert didn’t return an e-mail seeking comment. “I don’t think there are a lot people who really understand this industry, who understand what we have and just how good of a business this is,” Craig Monaghan, CEO of Duluth, Georgia-based Asbury Automotive, said in a telephone interview. “The richest guy in town is never the doctor or the lawyer. It’s the guy who owns the dealership. There’s a reason for that.” U.S. auto sales are on pace to exceed 14 million this year for the industry’s best total since 2007, according to Autodata Corp. The new-car market is on track to grow for a third consecutive year. The industry is rebounding after a plunge to 10.4 million light-vehicle sales in 2009, the worst year for the U.S. market since 1982. Annual deliveries averaged 16.8 million from 2000 to 2007, according to Autodata in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. The increasing sales are being spread across a smaller U.S. auto-dealer footprint, according to Urban Science , a Detroit- based consulting firm. Industry Rebound General Motors Co. (GM) and Chrysler Group LLC pared their retail networks as part of their 2009 U.S. government-backed bankruptcies. The U.S. industry now has fewer than 30,000 dealer franchises, down from almost 50,000 in 1997, Urban Science said in an Aug. 14 report. That means new-vehicle sales probably will climb to a record 805 per dealership in 2012 as demand recovers faster than estimated and carmakers keep the number of their retail outlets stable, according to the report. “In that scenario, where I’ve leaned out my cost structure to the bone, I’d rather be a dealer” than a supplier or automaker, Kevin Tynan , an automotive analyst with Bloomberg Industries based in Princeton, New Jersey, said in a telephone interview. “As the industry starts to recover, the retailers’ cost structure, which was leaned to the bone in 2009 and 2010, is probably still lean relative to before the crash.” Industrywide per-store dealership profit has almost tripled from 2008, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association, which represents 16,000 new-car dealers. The average U.S. auto dealer earned a pretax profit of $785,855 last year on revenue of $34.7 million, McLean, Virginia-based NADA said in its year-end report. Dealers’ average pretax profit was $279,685 in 2008. Labor Costs Auto retailers’ labor costs are variable because their workers’ compensation typically is tied to commissions for every car they sell or repair, Bloomberg Industries’ Tynan said. Automakers and suppliers have a more difficult time keeping those costs contained because they need to maintain much of their work force to keep plants operational. “As demand starts to come back, you have that lag where you have half the sales and back office people you had when we were at 16 million” annual vehicle sales, Tynan said. “You have this window of opportunity for expanded margins.” The “foundation” of AutoNation is its parts and service business, Jackson said. The retailer focused on keeping fixed costs down through the industry sales decline and relied on gross profit from that line of business to offset 90 percent or more of those costs. ‘91% Happy’ “When I wake up in the morning, I’m 91 percent happy before I leave the house,” Jackson told employees at an Atlanta town hall in August 2011. “I’m looking forward to the day that I wake up 100 percent happy. I’m going to sleep in.” AutoNation’s gross margin in the parts and service business exceeded 43 percent in every quarter during 2010 and has exceeded 41 percent in each of the last five periods, Bloomberg data shows. That compares to as much as a 9.8 percent margin in its used-vehicle retail business and as much as 7.8 percent in new vehicles. Asbury’s parts and service gross margin has averaged 55 percent in the last 10 quarters, the data show. The segment is the “real bread and butter” of Asbury’s business, said Monaghan, the CEO. ‘Recession-Resilient’ “It’s a business that just continues to perform in good times and bad,” he said. “I wouldn’t say it’s recession-proof, but it’s certainly very much recession-resilient.” AutoNation closed at an all-time high of $42.45 on July 19, while Asbury climbed to a record $29.93 on Sept. 14. Penske Automotive, based in Bloomfield Hills , Michigan , reached its best close ever on Sept. 17, rising to $30.32. “The dealer business model is a lot less cyclical than people think it is,” Matthew Nemer, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities based in San Francisco , said in a telephone interview. “In a deep recession, you may not need to get your bumper fixed, but if there’s a mechanical problem with the car and you use it to get to work, you need to get it fixed. That profit line is incredibly stable.” The share performance by the companies is a stark turnaround since the economic crisis four years ago. AutoNation fell 37 percent in 2008 and reached a low of $4.21 in October of that year. Asbury plunged 70 percent and slipped to as low as $2 the same month that year. Penske declined 56 percent in 2008 and dropped to $4.84 in March 2009. Bottom ‘Bounce’ “During the recession, the market basically priced all these companies as if they were going bankrupt,” Wells Fargo’s Nemer said. “The public dealers haven’t been around all that long and they’d never been through a deep recession. There was a little bit of fear of the unknown.” Nemer, whose family owns a chain of car dealerships, said auto retailers’ stock-market outperformance compared with carmakers and suppliers may reflect a “bounce” from deeper bottoms, rather than their prospects in a recovery. Carmakers may be better to own in that scenario, he said. “As the capacity starts to fill up, for the manufacturers where you have fixed capacity and you start to fill that capacity and cover your fixed costs, that’s where you get sort of explosive earnings growth,” he said. ‘Protected Business’ Monaghan said auto retailers still trade at relatively lower valuations compared to most retailers. Some investors discount their shares because car manufacturers need to give permission for adding additional stores. “Some people look at our model and say ‘well, they can’t grow because the manufacturer controls their ability to open a greenfield site,” he said. Those investors are overlooking the fact that automakers’ restrictions also shield retailers from added competitors entering their area. “You have a protected business that produces a very nice cash flow ,” he said. “They’ve missed what is really a very attractive investment here. It’s very consistent, reasonably predictable business that throws off cash.” To contact the reporter on this story: Craig Trudell in Southfield, Michigan at  ctrudell1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: Christian Baumgaertel at  cbaumgaertel@bloomberg.net ; Jamie Butters at  jbutters@bloomberg.net",['Craig Trudell'],"AutoNation Peerless Within U.S. Industry: Riskless Return AutoNation Inc.

Standard & Poor’s boosted the company to investment-grade last year, and Moody’s Investors Service in November assigned a positive outlook on its rating, the highest speculative-grade level. “We’re able to adjust our cost base very quickly to changes in the marketplace,” Jackson said. “The manufacturer and supplier business model has high fixed costs, is extremely cyclical and not very resilient.” Group 1 Automotive Inc. in Houston had the second-best total return at 131 percent and a volatility of 46, giving it second place in the ranking. Lithia Motors Inc. (LAD) , best by total return with a gain of 164 percent, ranked third, dragged down by the highest volatility in the group, at 60. Beating Suppliers AutoNation, Group 1, Lithia Motors, Asbury Automotive Group Inc. (ABG) , Penske Automotive Group Inc., and Sonic Automotive Inc. combined to post a 3.1 percent risk-adjusted return, topping parts suppliers at 2.2 percent and automakers at 1.05 percent. The ranking is based on a Bloomberg Industries index of automotive dealers and excludes used-car dealers America’s Car- Mart Inc., CarMax Inc. and Copart Inc., as well as AutoCanada Inc., which sells cars in Canada. The risk-adjusted return is calculated by dividing total return by volatility, or the degree of daily price-swing variation, giving a measure of income per unit of risk. The returns aren’t annualized. Higher volatility means an asset’s price can swing dramatically in a short period of time, increasing the prospect for unexpected losses. Lampert, Gates AutoNation benefited from a stable ownership, with Edward Lampert ’s RBS Partners LP hedge fund owning almost 40 percent of the company. The 50-year-old billionaire also personally held 18.6 million shares, a 15 percent stake, as of June 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Cascade Investment LLC, Bill Gates ’s personal money management firm, and his Gates Foundation hold ownership stakes of 13 percent and 2 percent, respectively. AutoNation, the second-largest U.S. stock holding of RBS, has delivered some of the best profits for Lampert, with annual gains of 31 percent since September of 2009. Sears Holding, RBS’s largest U.S. stock position, has languished at 2009 levels, gaining an annual 1.9 percent in the same period. Asbury Automotive provided a risk-adjusted return of 2.7 percent since September 2009. Billionaire Michael Dell ’s MSD Capital LP holds a 10.5 percent stake in Duluth, Georgia-based Asbury, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ‘Richest Guy’ Michael Larson , chief investment officer of Cascade Investment in Kirkland, Washington , and Todd Fogarty, a spokesman for MSD Capital, declined to comment for this story. A spokesmen for Lampert didn’t return an e-mail seeking comment. “I don’t think there are a lot people who really understand this industry, who understand what we have and just how good of a business this is,” Craig Monaghan, CEO of Duluth, Georgia-based Asbury Automotive, said in a telephone interview. “The richest guy in town is never the doctor or the lawyer. It’s the guy who owns the dealership. There’s a reason for that.” U.S. auto sales are on pace to exceed 14 million this year for the industry’s best total since 2007, according to Autodata Corp. The new-car market is on track to grow for a third consecutive year. The industry is rebounding after a plunge to 10.4 million light-vehicle sales in 2009, the worst year for the U.S. market since 1982. Annual deliveries averaged 16.8 million from 2000 to 2007, according to Autodata in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. The increasing sales are being spread across a smaller U.S. auto-dealer footprint, according to Urban Science , a Detroit- based consulting firm. Industry Rebound General Motors Co. (GM) and Chrysler Group LLC pared their retail networks as part of their 2009 U.S. government-backed bankruptcies. The U.S. industry now has fewer than 30,000 dealer franchises, down from almost 50,000 in 1997, Urban Science said in an Aug. 14 report. That means new-vehicle sales probably will climb to a record 805 per dealership in 2012 as demand recovers faster than estimated and carmakers keep the number of their retail outlets stable, according to the report. “In that scenario, where I’ve leaned out my cost structure to the bone, I’d rather be a dealer” than a supplier or automaker, Kevin Tynan , an automotive analyst with Bloomberg Industries based in Princeton, New Jersey, said in a telephone interview. “As the industry starts to recover, the retailers’ cost structure, which was leaned to the bone in 2009 and 2010, is probably still lean relative to before the crash.” Industrywide per-store dealership profit has almost tripled from 2008, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association, which represents 16,000 new-car dealers. The average U.S. auto dealer earned a pretax profit of $785,855 last year on revenue of $34.7 million, McLean, Virginia-based NADA said in its year-end report. Dealers’ average pretax profit was $279,685 in 2008. Labor Costs Auto retailers’ labor costs are variable because their workers’ compensation typically is tied to commissions for every car they sell or repair, Bloomberg Industries’ Tynan said. Automakers and suppliers have a more difficult time keeping those costs contained because they need to maintain much of their work force to keep plants operational. “As demand starts to come back, you have that lag where you have half the sales and back office people you had when we were at 16 million” annual vehicle sales, Tynan said. “You have this window of opportunity for expanded margins.” The “foundation” of AutoNation is its parts and service business, Jackson said. The retailer focused on keeping fixed costs down through the industry sales decline and relied on gross profit from that line of business to offset 90 percent or more of those costs. ‘91% Happy’ “When I wake up in the morning, I’m 91 percent happy before I leave the house,” Jackson told employees at an Atlanta town hall in August 2011. “I’m looking forward to the day that I wake up 100 percent happy. I’m going to sleep in.” AutoNation’s gross margin in the parts and service business exceeded 43 percent in every quarter during 2010 and has exceeded 41 percent in each of the last five periods, Bloomberg data shows. That compares to as much as a 9.8 percent margin in its used-vehicle retail business and as much as 7.8 percent in new vehicles. Asbury’s parts and service gross margin has averaged 55 percent in the last 10 quarters, the data show. The segment is the “real bread and butter” of Asbury’s business, said Monaghan, the CEO. ‘Recession-Resilient’ “It’s a business that just continues to perform in good times and bad,” he said. “I wouldn’t say it’s recession-proof, but it’s certainly very much recession-resilient.” AutoNation closed at an all-time high of $42.45 on July 19, while Asbury climbed to a record $29.93 on Sept. 14. Penske Automotive, based in Bloomfield Hills , Michigan , reached its best close ever on Sept. 17, rising to $30.32. “The dealer business model is a lot less cyclical than people think it is,” Matthew Nemer, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities based in San Francisco , said in a telephone interview. “In a deep recession, you may not need to get your bumper fixed, but if there’s a mechanical problem with the car and you use it to get to work, you need to get it fixed. That profit line is incredibly stable.” The share performance by the companies is a stark turnaround since the economic crisis four years ago. AutoNation fell 37 percent in 2008 and reached a low of $4.21 in October of that year. Asbury plunged 70 percent and slipped to as low as $2 the same month that year. Penske declined 56 percent in 2008 and dropped to $4.84 in March 2009. Bottom ‘Bounce’ “During the recession, the market basically priced all these companies as if they were going bankrupt,” Wells Fargo’s Nemer said. “The public dealers haven’t been around all that long and they’d never been through a deep recession. There was a little bit of fear of the unknown.” Nemer, whose family owns a chain of car dealerships, said auto retailers’ stock-market outperformance compared with carmakers and suppliers may reflect a “bounce” from deeper bottoms, rather than their prospects in a recovery. Carmakers may be better to own in that scenario, he said. “As the capacity starts to fill up, for the manufacturers where you have fixed capacity and you start to fill that capacity and cover your fixed costs, that’s where you get sort of explosive earnings growth,” he said. ‘Protected Business’ Monaghan said auto retailers still trade at relatively lower valuations compared to most retailers. Some investors discount their shares because car manufacturers need to give permission for adding additional stores. “Some people look at our model and say ‘well, they can’t grow because the manufacturer controls their ability to open a greenfield site,” he said. Those investors are overlooking the fact that automakers’ restrictions also shield retailers from added competitors entering their area. “You have a protected business that produces a very nice cash flow ,” he said. “They’ve missed what is really a very attractive investment here. It’s very consistent, reasonably predictable business that throws off cash.” To contact the reporter on this story: Craig Trudell in Southfield, Michigan at  ctrudell1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: Christian Baumgaertel at  cbaumgaertel@bloomberg.net ; Jamie Butters at  jbutters@bloomberg.net",11493,1859,-1
Apple IPhone 5 Gets Glowing Reviews,['Adam Satariano'],2012-09-19 11:52:02,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/apple-iphone-5-gets-glowing-reviews.html,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone 5 drew accolades from technology-gadget critics, who praised the smartphone’s lightweight body design, bigger screen and swifter data-download speeds even as some faulted its mapping tools. The iPhone 5, which is scheduled to reach stores Sept. 21, is the best smartphone on the market, map-software flaws aside, according to Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal. Ed Baig of USA Today said the device keeps Apple ahead of rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , and Rich Jaroslovsky of Bloomberg called it the “handsomest phone you can buy.” The mostly positive reviews stand to fuel what’s already turning out to be robust demand for Apple’s best-selling product. The company said on Sept. 17 that it received more than 2 million orders in 24 hours, more than double the record set when the company introduced the iPhone 4S last year. “Nearly every feature has been upgraded, with a focus on what counts: screen, sound, camera, speed,” David Pogue  wrote in the New York Times. According to Mossberg and Jaroslovsky, one of the iPhone’s biggest drawbacks is the mapping software created by Apple to replace the Google Inc. (GOOG) maps application that had come pre- installed on the iPhone since 2007. For instance, Apple’s version doesn’t have public-transit routing, Mossberg said. Jaroslovsky said the software was easily confused giving directions, especially in urban areas. Both praised the device more generally. “Apple has taken an already great product and made it better,” Mossberg wrote. Eye Jab The iPhone will be available Sept. 21 in the U.S., Australia, Canada , France, Germany, Hong Kong , Japan, Singapore and the U.K. With a new wireless contract, the device costs $199, $299 and $399, depending on the amount of memory. Pogue criticized Apple’s change to a new dock connector, saying the move hampered the device’s compatibility with cars, clocks and speakers. The adapters being sold by Apple, which cost $30 or $40, don’t work for all accessories, he said. With the change, Apple gave away a competitive advantage of having a network of accessories available to use, Pogue said. “That’s not just a slap in the face to loyal customers -- it’s a jab in the eye,” Pogue said. One of the biggest improvements for the iPhone is its speed, said Baig of USA Today. The iPhone 5 connects to new high-speed wireless networks known as LTE, or long-term evolution, that are being introduced by companies such as AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Wireless , letting users more seamlessly watch video or toggle between Web pages or applications. ‘A Gem’ “People have always had lofty expectations for the iPhone 5, especially as the competition stiffens,” Baig wrote. “In delivering a fast, attractive, LTE-capable and larger-screen handset, Apple has met those expectations with a gem.” Bloomberg’s Jaroslovsky praised the device’s battery life, which for other smartphones drains more quickly when working on an LTE network. Apple, based in Cupertino, California , may sell 6 million to 10 million iPhones during the opening weekend, according to Gene Munster , an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. (PJC) With the iPhone 5 going on sale in 22 more countries on Sept. 28, Apple may sell another 49 million from October to December, according to Munster. The iPhone accounts for about two-thirds of Apple’s profit, helping make it the world’s most valuable company. Shares rose less than 1 percent to a record $701.91 yesterday. Because Apple only releases one new model a year, a successful debut is critical for the company’s continued growth. That compares with the several smartphones released each year by Samsung, Apple’s main competitor in a global smartphone market that surged 62 percent to $219.1 billion last year, according data compiled by Bloomberg Industries. Samsung, which makes smartphones with bigger screens than the new iPhone 5, has sold more than 20 million units of its Galaxy S III smartphone. “The iPhone 5 is by no means perfect, and we’re lucky there are a lot of really good smartphones on the market,” Jaroslovsky said. “But only one great one.” To contact the reporter on this story: Adam Satariano in San Francisco at  asatariano1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net",['Adam Satariano'],"Apple IPhone 5 Gets Glowing Reviews Apple Inc.

BOJ Fails to Match Fed in Quashing Deflation Bets: Japan Credit,['Masaki Kondo' 'Monami Yui' 'Shigeki Nozawa'],2012-09-19 04:15:49,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/boj-fails-to-match-fed-in-quashing-deflation-bets-japan-credit.html,"Japan’s bond market is signaling the nation’s central bank won’t succeed in emulating the Federal Reserve in printing its way to an economic recovery. Japan’s 30-year bond yield was 1.19 percentage points lower than for similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries on Sept. 14, the most since May 10 and suggesting little concern among investors that inflation will eat into the value of the yen-based debt. A Bloomberg News survey of economists showed that none anticipate inflation to meet the Bank of Japan’s 1 percent target through the end of March 2014. Since Fed Governor Ben S. Bernanke unveiled open-ended bond purchases last week, expectations for U.S. price gains climbed to a 16-month high. The BOJ, which bolstered monetary stimulus at the end of a two-day meeting today, has so far failed to turn around a decade of falling prices that weighs on growth. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda has joined the deflation fight too, pledging to beat it within a year as he faces party elections on Sept. 21. “There is a big difference in the degree of enthusiasm between the BOJ and the Fed,” said Takeshi Minami , chief economist in Tokyo at Norinchukin Research Institute Co. “The BOJ just takes a wait-and-see attitude despite its inflation goal, while the Fed is striving to reduce unemployment.” Japan’s central bank increased its asset-purchase fund to 55 trillion yen ($695 billion) from 45 trillion yen, according to a statement released in Tokyo today. Five of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted easing while 11 forecast the action by October. JGBs Advance Japanese bonds rose, with yields on the benchmark 10-year government securities falling two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.795 percent after the BOJ’s move. The Fed introduced purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a month on Sept. 13 in a third round of so-called quantitative easing, or QE, to stimulate the economy through lower borrowing costs. Policy makers are looking for “ongoing, sustained improvement” in the job market, Bernanke said. The gap in yield between five-year Treasuries and similar- maturity inflation-linked debt, a gauge of expectations for U.S. consumer prices, widened to 2.47 percentage points on Sept. 17, the most since May 2011. The one-year break-even rate slid to a low of negative 0.3 percentage point on June 29. Meanwhile, the five-year break-even in Japan was at 0.61 percentage point yesterday, compared with minus 0.38 percentage point in November. Japan’s consumer prices excluding food and energy have fallen an average of 0.6 percent per month from a year earlier over the past 10 years, according to government data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with average gains of 1.9 percent in the U.S. Corporate Bonds Elsewhere in Japan’s credit markets, Tokyo-based Global One Real Estate Investment Corp. hired Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. for a sale of four-year bonds, the brokerage said in a statement yesterday. The prefectures of Kyoto and Chiba and Japan Finance Corp. also hired banks for offerings of securities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The extra yield that investors demand to hold Japanese corporate notes instead of sovereign debt climbed five basis points since the end of July to 53 basis points yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The spread for company bonds worldwide fell 30 to 171 in the period, according to the data. Aging Population An aging population is weighing on demand for goods and services in the world’s third-largest economy, helping prolong deflation. More than a quarter of Japan’s population will be over 65 years old in 2014, the highest ratio globally, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates compiled by Bloomberg. “The prevailing atmosphere shows no clue on when inflation will rise into positive territory and stay there,” said Daisaku Ueno , a senior foreign-exchange and fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley in Tokyo., one of the 25 primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales. Noda made ending deflation part of his campaign to lead Japan’s ruling Democratic Party of Japan, with a Yomiuri newspaper poll showing he’s favored to win at a party election this week. He’s pledged to call national elections “soon.” While the persistent decline in consumer prices saps economic growth, currency strength is hurting the competitiveness of Japan’s exporters such as Panasonic Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , threatening to derail a recovery from last year’s record earthquake and tsunami. The yen traded at 79.07 per dollar as of 1:06 p.m. in Tokyo, compared with the post- World War II high of 75.35 reached Oct. 31. China Tensions The nation’s overseas shipments fell for a third month in August, dropping 7.5 percent from a year earlier, according to the median estimate of economists before the Ministry of Finance releases the data tomorrow. Carlos Ghosn , chief executive officer of Nissan, Japan’s second-largest automaker, said this month that the rising currency is deterring the company from expanding domestic production. Adding to exporters’ plight are diplomatic tensions between Japan and China that have escalated since Noda’s government last week purchased and nationalized islands claimed by both nations. Nissan halted production at some plants while Panasonic reported damage to its operations in China as protesters smashed store fronts and cars in demonstrations. “Japanese companies’ sales and reputation with Chinese consumers are likely to be affected, at least in the short term,” Fitch Ratings said yesterday in a statement. Sovereign Risk The cost to insure Japan’s sovereign debt against nonpayment for five years was at 75.4 basis points yesterday after touching 66.5 basis points on Sept. 12, the lowest since December 2010, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. A drop in the contracts signals improving perceptions of creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite. Noda last month pushed through legislation to raise Japan’s sales tax for the first time since 1997 in a bid to lessen the government’s dependence on debt. The BOJ’s balance sheet has expanded 42 percent since September 2008 when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed, sparking the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The Fed’s total assets have tripled during that period. The U.S. central bank bought $1.75 trillion of mortgage and Treasury debt in the first round of quantitative easing , or QE1, from November 2008 to March 2010. It then acquired $600 billion of Treasuries between November 2010 and June 2011 in QE2, bringing the total purchases to $2.35 trillion. Asset Purchases The BOJ has bought assets worth about $1.42 trillion since November 2008 through its purchases of government debt and the asset-purchase program. BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa told reporters on Aug. 9 that it is important to explain the central bank’s methods in an easy-to-understand manner rather than paying “ lip service .” Bernanke said at a news conference last week that he’s adopting a ""Main Street policy"" to create jobs. “In terms of raising expectations for inflation, the Fed is more successful than the BOJ,” said Jun Kawakami, a market economist at Mizuho Securities Co., a primary dealer. Compared with Bernanke, Shirakawa comes across as serious and thus “lacks a sense of showmanship,” he said.

It then acquired $600 billion of Treasuries between November 2010 and June 2011 in QE2, bringing the total purchases to $2.35 trillion. Asset Purchases The BOJ has bought assets worth about $1.42 trillion since November 2008 through its purchases of government debt and the asset-purchase program. BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa told reporters on Aug. 9 that it is important to explain the central bank’s methods in an easy-to-understand manner rather than paying “ lip service .” Bernanke said at a news conference last week that he’s adopting a ""Main Street policy"" to create jobs. “In terms of raising expectations for inflation, the Fed is more successful than the BOJ,” said Jun Kawakami, a market economist at Mizuho Securities Co., a primary dealer. Compared with Bernanke, Shirakawa comes across as serious and thus “lacks a sense of showmanship,” he said.

Spanish Train Driver Said to Be Arrested in Crash Probe,['Angeline Benoit'],2013-07-26 13:50:19,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/spanish-probe-into-rail-crash-focuses-on-speed.html,"Spain arrested the driver of the train that crashed two days ago in the northwest killing 80 people, as judicial and government investigations focus on whether he was speeding. The driver was detained yesterday evening in the hospital where he was treated and is being interrogated, said a Spanish police official today who asked not to be named. The Public Works Ministry ordered a probe from an independent body that looks into rail accidents, as the train wasn’t on high-speed track when it crashed and may have exceeded the 80 kilometers (50 miles) per hour limit, a ministry spokeswoman said by phone. There were 218 passengers on board when the train derailed on the Madrid-Ferrol route at 8:41 p.m. local time on a curve just outside the city of Santiago de Compostela in the Galicia region, state-owned rail company Renfe said. Thirty-two people, four of them minors, remain in critical condition in hospitals, the Galicia government said today. El Pais newspaper reported it was traveling at more than twice the allowed speed. “The key point is how come this train was going too fast, despite it being a modern train with many safety systems,” Christian Wolmar , a transport historian and the author of “Broken Rails,” an analysis of Britain’s train network, said by telephone yesterday. “The driver should not have been able to go this fast.” The tragedy occurred on a line that is part of the high-speed network that successive governments have made a symbol of the nation’s modernization. Security-camera video shown on Spanish television portrayed the rear of the locomotive whipping off the rails in the curve before passenger cars broke into pieces as they collided with a concrete wall along the track. Double Speed Limit? The train was moving at 190 kilometers per hour as it entered the section of track, El Pais reported, citing a radio conversation between the driver and train-control staff. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy yesterday said that both the rail authorities and the courts are working to establish the reasons for the accident, without commenting on what they may have been. He declared three days of national mourning. The derailment happened between 3 kilometers and 4 kilometers from the station in Santiago, according to a statement from ADIF, the administrator of Spain’s rail network. The tracks where the accident occurred aren’t equipped with the European Rail Traffic Management System, said a spokesman for the ADIF rail operator today in a telephone interview, asking not to be named in line with company policy. The ERTMS monitors train speeds and overrides drivers if they breach restrictions, he said. The system works well in parts of Europe where it has been installed, European Commission spokesman Joe Hennon told reporters today in Brussels. Automatic Braking Spain’s 15,000 kilometers of conventional and high-speed track are currently equipped with a system that forces the train to slow down if an obstacle is detected ahead, he said. The ERTMS system is being rolled out on 2,500 kilometers of the track, the spokesman said. Automatic breaking involves communication with a second security system on board the train, he said. The accident occurred during the culmination of the city’s St. James festivities, the Christian religious ceremony and popular festival that commemorates the saint known in Spanish as Santiago. Many locals return to the city from Madrid to join the celebrations, and pilgrims from around the world traditionally converge on foot and attend mass in the cathedral, where relics of the apostle are said to be held. The city of about 100,000 people is situated about 600 kilometers northwest of the capital, near the Atlantic coast. Paris Crash There are no material parallels with a crash south of Paris on July 12 that killed six people and in which the fault lay with the track, Wolmar said. The Alvia 730 train was built by a joint venture of Spain’s Talgo and Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) , according to Cadena Ser wire service. The hybrid diesel-electric train has a top speed of 240 kph. As many as 86 people died when trains collided near Seville in southern Spain in 1972. In 2004, 191 people were killed when groups inspired by al-Qaeda planted bombs on commuter trains in Madrid three days before national elections. Spain opened its first high-speed rail line in 1992 and currently has the world’s third-largest network, with 2,515 kilometers of tracks, according to figures from the Union Internationale des Chemins de Fer, a global organization of rail operators.

Siemens Board Members to Meet as Pressure on Loescher Mounts,['Alex Webb' 'Angela Maier'],2013-07-27 13:12:31,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/siemens-supervisory-board-said-to-plan-leadership-talks-1-.html,"Siemens AG (SIE) ’s supervisory board members will meet this weekend to discuss the leadership of Europe’s largest engineering company as investors and analysts question how long Chief Executive Officer Peter Loescher can keep his job. Loescher, brought in in 2007 to clean up after the biggest corruption scandal in German history, yesterday vowed to fight on after cutting a profit forecast for the fifth time in his six-year tenure. By contrast, competitor General Electric Co. (GE) last week reported second-quarter profit that beat analyst estimates, helped by a record order backlog. “I’m underweight on Siemens and am glad that I am,” said Carsten Hilck, a fund manager at Union Investment, which holds less than one percent of Siemens shares. The target cut “is not unexpected. This sort of thing can always happen at Siemens and it doesn’t seem to be getting any better.” Austrian native Loescher, who joined Siemens from drugmaker Merck & Co. as the first CEO hired from outside the company, has presided over a failed push into environmentally friendly energy which led to spiraling costs, while writing down the value of acquisitions. Last year, he acknowledged that he had been slow to react to the economic downturn and the company on July 25 pinned the latest forecast cut on “lower market expectations.” ‘Hasn’t Delivered’ Loescher told Sueddeutsche Zeitung yesterday that he won’t resign and that his contract runs until 2017. A Siemens spokesman confirmed Loescher’s comments on staying put while declining to comment on speculation about his future. German newspapers and magazines reported conflicting information on potential successors to the CEO. Chief Financial Officer Joe Kaeser and industry division head Siegfried Russwurm could jointly replace Loescher, Sueddeutsche said, without saying where it got the information. While Kaeser is the favorite for the job, supervisory board chairman Gerhard Cromme could act as CEO at least temporarily, Die Welt reported today, without citing anyone. Der Spiegel said Siemens weighed Russwurm, Kaeser as well as energy division chief Michael Suess as candidates yesterday. “Loescher just hasn’t delivered, I can well imagine that he will go,” said Daniela Bergdolt of DSW, Germany ’s largest association for private investors, and who represented one million shares at Siemens’s investor meeting, equivalent to 0.1 percent of the company’s shares. “The explanation is missing, that’s my issue. General Electric says it’s the most wonderful year that we can think of.” GE Profit Competitor GE last week said demand for jet engines and oil-and-gas drilling equipment drove the order backlog to a record. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company also affirmed its forecast for 2013 profit-margin expansion and industrial revenue growth. Siemens shares on July 25 dropped as much as 7.6 percent, the biggest decline since March 2009, erasing 4.4 billion euros of market value. Siemens has fallen 1.3 percent this year, while ABB added 11 percent and GE gained 17 percent. Since Loescher took over in 2007, Siemens shares have dropped about 23 percent. The German DAX benchmark index has risen about 5 percent in the same period. Worker and shareholder representatives will meet separately over the weekend to discuss the company’s leadership, according to a person familiar with the plans. Worker Criticism Loescher is also facing criticism from his own workers. In anonymous postings on Siemens’ internal discussion forum, employees last week called for Kaeser to replace Peter Loescher as chief executive officer, according to screenshots obtained by Bloomberg News. The company this week forbade unattributed postings on the web forum, and said in an internal document the move is not related to the “allegedly poor opinion among employees towards Peter Loescher.” A Siemens spokesman declined to comment on the talks between supervisory board members, the internal forum and guidelines for employees. Loescher on July 25 said that Siemens no longer predicts an operating profit margin of at least 12 percent of sales in the 12 months through September 2014. The profit goal was set last November as part of a 6 billion-euro savings plan. Siemens had a profit margin of 9.5 percent in 2012, when ABB and GE had margins of 10.3 percent and 15 percent respectively. The forecast was cut after a majority of units said in their internal predictions that they will probably miss their goals, two people familiar with the matter said. The gap in so-called sector profit between the forecast and the actual numbers is currently 1.5 billion euros, one person said. Profitability Efforts Loescher told employees this year that it’s fair to judge him on his efforts to improve profitability at Siemens, which was Germany’s biggest company by market capitalization between July 2009 and July 2012 before it was overtaken by software maker SAP AG. (SAP)  Thornburg Investment, which at the end of May had the 13th biggest Siemens shareholding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, sold its stake, Managing Director Bill Fries said by phone. “We changed our view,” he said. Siemens fiscal third-quarter profit for the three months through June has been hurt by about 100 million euros in costs for faulty wind turbines, people familiar with the matter said. Siemens is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter earnings on Aug. 1. The supervisory board will meet in its entirety one day beforehand, according to one person familiar with the matter. The new charges add to provisions of 550 million euros for offshore power transmission problems and delays in train deliveries reported earlier this year. In June, Siemens said it will close its solar power unit following losses of at least 784 million euros since 2011. The unit could trim earnings by 500 million euros this year, it said in May. Economic Headwinds “The admission their operational restructuring won’t be able to lift their Sector EBIT margins back to their 2011 levels is likely to result in many investors stepping back,” William Blair & Co. analyst Nicholas Heymann , who rates Siemens market perform, said. “Siemens has got an inertia factor as it reworks its portfolio while ABB is as adept as you can get.” Loescher has said that his job at Siemens isn’t made easier by the economic headwind he’s facing. “We are missing a growth engine around the world,” Loescher said in a Bloomberg Television interview in May. ABB, the world’s largest maker of power transformers, said that second-quarter orders fell 7 percent from a year earlier to $9.3 billion as lower power-utility investments in Europe weighed on orders. At the same time, ABB reported a 16 percent increase in net income and kept its 2013 forecast. Following Siemens’ latest forecast cut, the pressure on Loescher will continue to increase, said Kronberg, Germany-based Fairesearch analyst Heinz Steffen. “Loescher will again be in the line of fire,” he said. “There just has been no progress.” To contact the reporters on this story: Alex Webb in Munich at  awebb25@bloomberg.net ; Angela Maier in Munich at  amaier8@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Simon Thiel at  sthiel1@bloomberg.net",['Alex WebbAngela Maier'],"Siemens Board Members to Meet as Pressure on Loescher Mounts Siemens AG (SIE) ’s supervisory board members will meet this weekend to discuss the leadership of Europe’s largest engineering company as investors and analysts question how long Chief Executive Officer Peter Loescher can keep his job.

Consumer Sentiment in U.S. Increases to Six-Year High July,['Victoria Stilwell'],2013-07-26 14:29:36,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/michigan-consumer-sentiment-index-increased-to-85-1-in-july.html,"Consumer confidence unexpectedly increased in July to the highest level in six years as Americans’ views of their finances improved. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of consumer sentiment advanced to 85.1 in July from 84.1 at the end of June. Economists in a Bloomberg survey called for 84, according to the median projection after a preliminary reading of 83.9. An increase in personal wealth tied to higher property values and stock portfolios is keeping confidence elevated and consumers spending. Stronger finances, along with job gains that have picked up from the second half of 2012, are also helping blunt the effects of higher payroll taxes. “The labor market’s better, you’re seeing home prices rise, you’re seeing equity prices rise, so there are a lot of things out there to be positive about,” said Brian Jones , senior U.S. economist in New York at Societe Generale , who predicted an increase in confidence from June. “If you think about the things that drive consumer confidence, they should be rising as well through the end of the year.” Stocks fell, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index heading for its first weekly decline in more than a month, as investors weighed corporate earnings. The S&P 500 decreased 0.5 percent to 1,682.43 at 10:29 a.m. in New York. Estimates (CONSSENT) of the 63 economists in the Bloomberg survey ranged from 83 to 86. The index is close to the average of 89 in the five years leading to the last recession that began in December 2007. During the 18-month slump that ended in June 2009, the gauge averaged 64.2. Buying Attitudes The survey showed income and job growth helped bolster buying attitudes, especially for big purchases such as cars and homes. Younger households reported greater incomes, reflecting improvements in employment and hours worked, while middle- and upper-income Americans were more likely to report asset gains. Today’s figures compare with the weekly Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index which rose last week to match its highest level since January 2008. The Bloomberg gauge improved to minus 27.3 in the period ended July 21 from minus 28.4. The Michigan survey’s current conditions index, which takes stock of Americans’ view of their personal finances, climbed to a six-year high of 98.6 in July from 93.8 last month. The preliminary July figure was 99.7. Expectations Dim The index of expectations six months from now fell to 76.5 this month from 77.8 in June. The preliminary July reading was 73.8. Expectations of higher borrowing costs dimmed the reading on expectations for the economy. The survey results showed interest rates were expected to climb in the coming year by 68 percent of all consumers, up from 55 percent in June and the highest share since August 2006. The consumer sentiment measure has increased since the end of last year, when it stood at 72.9. More optimism is translating into higher sales at companies such as US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  Tempe, Arizona-based US Airways , on track to become the world’s largest carrier once it completes its merger with AMR Corp., reported higher revenue in the second quarter as demand recovered from the effects of across-the board federal spending cuts, President Scott Kirby said on a July 24 conference call with analysts. More Demand “Going forward, the demand environment remains quite good for both leisure and business demand,” Kirby said on the call. “Stronger consumer confidence, business confidence and macroeconomic performance seemed to be combining to drive the improved revenue environment.” Confidence is getting a boost from an improving labor market. Employment climbed by 202,000 a month on average in the first six months of this year, up from 180,000 in the second half of 2012, Labor Department data show. Americans may also be feeling wealthier as real estate prices climb and stocks hold near record highs. Home values in the U.S. increased 12.2 percent in May from a year earlier, the largest advance since February 2006, according to data earlier this month from Irvine , California-based CoreLogic Inc. The S&P 500 is hovering close to the record high of 1,695.53 reached on July 22. Inflation Expectations Today’s Michigan survey showed that Americans expect an inflation rate of 3.1 percent over the next year, up from 3 percent in June. Over the next five years, Americans expect a 2.8 percent rate of inflation, down from 2.9 percent in the previous three months. Inflation expectations are little changed from the end of 2012. Some companies are finding they still need to cater to the price-sensitive consumer as unemployment lingers above 7 percent. Some Wendy’s Co. “customers are just very sensitive to the economics that they face in their life,” Chief Executive Officer Emil Brolick said in a July 23 conference call to discuss second quarter earnings. “You have to give them a price value offering if you’re going to get them to come to your restaurant significantly.” To contact the reporter on this story: Victoria Stilwell in Washington at vstilwell1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chris Wellisz at cwellisz@bloomberg.net",['Victoria Stilwell'],"Consumer Sentiment in U.S. Increases to Six-Year High July Consumer confidence unexpectedly increased in July to the highest level in six years as Americans’ views of their finances improved.

Stronger finances, along with job gains that have picked up from the second half of 2012, are also helping blunt the effects of higher payroll taxes. “The labor market’s better, you’re seeing home prices rise, you’re seeing equity prices rise, so there are a lot of things out there to be positive about,” said Brian Jones , senior U.S. economist in New York at Societe Generale , who predicted an increase in confidence from June. “If you think about the things that drive consumer confidence, they should be rising as well through the end of the year.” Stocks fell, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index heading for its first weekly decline in more than a month, as investors weighed corporate earnings. The S&P 500 decreased 0.5 percent to 1,682.43 at 10:29 a.m. in New York. Estimates (CONSSENT) of the 63 economists in the Bloomberg survey ranged from 83 to 86. The index is close to the average of 89 in the five years leading to the last recession that began in December 2007. During the 18-month slump that ended in June 2009, the gauge averaged 64.2. Buying Attitudes The survey showed income and job growth helped bolster buying attitudes, especially for big purchases such as cars and homes. Younger households reported greater incomes, reflecting improvements in employment and hours worked, while middle- and upper-income Americans were more likely to report asset gains. Today’s figures compare with the weekly Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index which rose last week to match its highest level since January 2008. The Bloomberg gauge improved to minus 27.3 in the period ended July 21 from minus 28.4. The Michigan survey’s current conditions index, which takes stock of Americans’ view of their personal finances, climbed to a six-year high of 98.6 in July from 93.8 last month. The preliminary July figure was 99.7. Expectations Dim The index of expectations six months from now fell to 76.5 this month from 77.8 in June. The preliminary July reading was 73.8. Expectations of higher borrowing costs dimmed the reading on expectations for the economy. The survey results showed interest rates were expected to climb in the coming year by 68 percent of all consumers, up from 55 percent in June and the highest share since August 2006. The consumer sentiment measure has increased since the end of last year, when it stood at 72.9. More optimism is translating into higher sales at companies such as US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  Tempe, Arizona-based US Airways , on track to become the world’s largest carrier once it completes its merger with AMR Corp., reported higher revenue in the second quarter as demand recovered from the effects of across-the board federal spending cuts, President Scott Kirby said on a July 24 conference call with analysts. More Demand “Going forward, the demand environment remains quite good for both leisure and business demand,” Kirby said on the call. “Stronger consumer confidence, business confidence and macroeconomic performance seemed to be combining to drive the improved revenue environment.” Confidence is getting a boost from an improving labor market. Employment climbed by 202,000 a month on average in the first six months of this year, up from 180,000 in the second half of 2012, Labor Department data show. Americans may also be feeling wealthier as real estate prices climb and stocks hold near record highs. Home values in the U.S. increased 12.2 percent in May from a year earlier, the largest advance since February 2006, according to data earlier this month from Irvine , California-based CoreLogic Inc. The S&P 500 is hovering close to the record high of 1,695.53 reached on July 22. Inflation Expectations Today’s Michigan survey showed that Americans expect an inflation rate of 3.1 percent over the next year, up from 3 percent in June. Over the next five years, Americans expect a 2.8 percent rate of inflation, down from 2.9 percent in the previous three months. Inflation expectations are little changed from the end of 2012. Some companies are finding they still need to cater to the price-sensitive consumer as unemployment lingers above 7 percent. Some Wendy’s Co. “customers are just very sensitive to the economics that they face in their life,” Chief Executive Officer Emil Brolick said in a July 23 conference call to discuss second quarter earnings. “You have to give them a price value offering if you’re going to get them to come to your restaurant significantly.” To contact the reporter on this story: Victoria Stilwell in Washington at vstilwell1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chris Wellisz at cwellisz@bloomberg.net",5217,851,9

Job Gains Signal U.S. Doing Better Than GDP Shows: Economy,['Shobhana Ch' 'ra'],2013-07-26 21:08:49,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/job-gains-signal-u-s-doing-better-than-gdp-shows-economy-1-.html,"Judging by the figures for growth, the U.S. economy is in the doldrums. Labor-market data tell a more positive story. Payrolls climbed by 202,000 a month on average from January through June, up from 180,000 in the second half of 2012, according to the Labor Department. Such gains are typically linked with gross domestic product growing close to 3 percent, about double what government data may show next week, say economists at UniCredit Group and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. “The employment numbers are closer to the true picture,” said Harm Bandholz , chief U.S. economist at UniCredit in New York and the top payroll forecaster in the past two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “I’m confident GDP growth will pick up in the second half and even more in 2014.” The weight of the evidence also tips the balance toward a more favorable outcome as federal tax receipts rise at the fastest pace in six years, measures of consumer confidence reach the highest levels since at least 2008, and sales of autos and homes and housing rebound. That helps explain why companies from General Electric Co. (GE) to Texas Industries Inc. (TXI) plan to keep investing and hiring. After adjusting for the increase in rates that took effect this year, employee income-tax withholdings were up about 6 percent in June compared with a year earlier, the best showing for that month since 2007, according to calculations based on Treasury data by Joseph LaVorgna , the New York-based chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank. More receipts point to gains in employment, rising wages or a combination of both. Tax Receipts “Tax receipts are confirming the improvement in the labor market, but GDP seems to be overstating the weakness in output,” said LaVorgna. GDP in the first half of the year gives the impression of a “lousy” economy whereas it’s actually been “decent,” he said. It “reinforces the view that the second half will be better.” Stocks rose today, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index erasing losses in the final 30 minutes of trading, as investors weighed quarterly earnings reports. The S&P 500 climbed 0.1 percent to 1,691.65 at the close in New York. Growth in the first half of 2013 was restrained by the effect of federal government cutbacks and increase in taxes which is likely to wane. Slower inventory building and a wider trade deficit also curbed the expansion last quarter, when GDP rose at a 1 percent annualized rate, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey ahead of Commerce Department data due on July 31. The economy grew at a 1.8 percent pace in the first quarter. Tracking Spending GDP is the sum of all goods and services produced as tracked by consumer spending , government outlays and business investment on such things as plants, equipment and inventories. It also includes the value of exports minus imports. Expanding job openings , home prices that are growing at the fastest pace since before the recession and record-high equity values are helping shore up household confidence. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index (COMFCOMF) climbed last week to match the highest level since January 2008 as Americans grew more upbeat about the economy. A similar measure from Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan issued today reached a six-year high for July. More confident consumers are spending on big-ticket items. Cars (SAARTOTL) and light trucks sold in June at the strongest pace since November 2007, according to Ward’s Automotive Group. Ford Motor Co. (F) on July 23 said it will hire 3,000 salaried employees this year, 800 more than originally planned. Housing Rebound The housing rebound is another sign of an improving economic outlook. Texas Industries, a supplier of construction materials, finished commissioning a 1.4 million-ton cement facility and acquired 42 ready-mix plant sites in the quarter ended May 31 to capitalize on growth in the east Texas market. The Dallas-based company is accelerating work on an old kiln to bring back production capacity by early 2014. United Rentals Inc. (URI) said it purchased more equipment and hired 93 sales people toward its goal of adding 120 to 150, and expects a “robust back half of the year.” The Greenwich, Connecticut-based building-equipment rental company’s recent surveys show key clients remain bullish and a record-low number of customers expect a decline in business conditions. “We’re exactly where we want to be in the recovery, with higher rates, volume, and utilization on our larger fleet,” Michael Kneeland, United Rentals’ chief executive officer, said on a July 17 teleconference. “It tells us that the market activity is picking up.” Annual Revisions The disconnect between hiring and growth may begin to narrow when, along with second-quarter growth figures, the Commerce Department next week issues GDP revisions, said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research LLC in New York. The government annually updates the growth data by incorporating more complete information that is only available with a lag. This year will be a more comprehensive overhaul, something that is done about every five years, and will include changes in the way GDP is calculated, which could potentially affect the figures back to 1929. GDP “looks increasingly like the outlier” relative to other data such as corporate profits, said Dutta. “Overwhelmingly, the signals are that the economy is not only doing OK, but doing better than a lot of people think.” A stronger economy would make Federal Reserve projections easier to achieve this year and next, said Dutta. In June, Fed officials forecast the U.S. will grow 2.3 percent to 2.6 percent this year and 3 percent to 3.5 percent in 2014. Income Gains Gains in income and profits are another sign that growth is probably stronger than currently thought, according to Joseph Carson , director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein LP in New York. Fed research has shown that gross domestic income, or the money earned by the people, businesses and government agencies whose purchases go into calculating growth, is a better gauge of the economy. After multiple revisions over time, the growth estimates tend to align more closely with the income figures, rather than the other way around, according to a 2010 paper by Fed economist Jeremy J. Nalewaik. GDP has increased at a 3.4 percent annualized rate since the third quarter of 2012 before adjusting for inflation, while GDI grew at a 4.9 percent pace, Carson said. He projects the economy’s growth rate will be revised up for the past few years when the update is released on July 31. Lingering Effects While the lingering effects of the worst recession in the post-World War II era -- including diminished productivity following the plunge in business investment -- have contributed to slower growth, “it’s certainly credible that the GDP number has been undercounted,” said James O’Sullivan , chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. “The employment data are strong enough already to be consistent with at least a 3 percent pace of GDP growth,” he said. Companies such as Fairfield, Connecticut-based General Electric are gearing up to meet demand. GE is investing in the aviation and oil and gas divisions, opening factories and making purchases including Lufkin Industries Inc. to boost manufacturing and service operations. “Orders in the U.S. were the strongest we’ve seen in some time,” and backlogs grew, Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt said on GE’s earnings teleconference on July 19. “You’re going to get some gathering momentum I think in the second half of the year.” To contact the reporter on this story: Shobhana Chandra in Washington at schandra1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Christopher Wellisz at cwellisz@bloomberg.net",['Shobhana Chra'],"Job Gains Signal U.S. Doing Better Than GDP Shows: Economy Judging by the figures for growth, the U.S. economy is in the doldrums.

Kia Motors Profit Exceeds Estimates on Higher Sales in China,['Rose Kim'],2013-07-26 06:31:43,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/kia-motors-profit-exceeds-estimates-on-higher-sales-in-china.html,"Kia Motors Corp. (000270) ’s second-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates after South Korea’s second-largest carmaker sold more vehicles in China. Net income excluding minority interests rose 7.7 percent to 1.18 trillion won ($1.06 billion), compared with 1.1 trillion won a year earlier, the Seoul-based company said in a statement today. Profit exceeded the 1.05 trillion won average of 18 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg in the past 28 days. Revenue increased 4.5 percent to 13.1 trillion won. Kia’s sales in China have jumped 22 percent on higher demand for its K3 sedan, while its Sportage sport-utility vehicle lifted deliveries by 1.5 percent in Europe, helping the automaker buck an industrywide slump in the region. The gains countered falling demand for its vehicles in the U.S., Kia’s biggest market, and in South Korea. “Kia exceeded expectations today, thanks to increasing sales in China ,” said Lee Sang Hyun, an auto analyst at NH Investment & Securities Co. “Moving forward, things look good for the company, especially with its new model the Soul wagon scheduled to be unveiled in the second half.” Operating profit , or sales minus the cost of goods sold and administrative expenses, fell 8.5 percent to 1.13 trillion won. That compares with the 1.01 trillion won average of 18 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Kia rose 0.7 percent to 61,200 won at the close in Seoul trading. The benchmark Kospi index gained 0.1 percent. China Sales Kia’s deliveries in China increased, helped by its K3 small sedan introduced in the country in October. Sales from its China factory rose 24 percent, according to data on the automaker’s website. The company revised its sales target in China for this year to at least 520,000 units, up from 500,000 units, Chief Financial Officer Park Han Woo said during a conference call in Seoul today. Production will also increase next year when its third plant in the country starts operations as early as March, Park said. Kia’s sales advanced 1.5 percent in Europe, led by sales of Sportage sport-utility vehicle and the new Cee’d hatchback. Industrywide deliveries in the region declined 4.1 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Higher Incentives Kia spent 19 percent more on incentive costs for passenger cars in the U.S. last quarter, according to Autodata. Its sales fell 0.2 percent last quarter, compared with the industrywide growth of 8.5 percent, according to company data. The won strengthened 2.4 percent against the yen last quarter, curbing Kia and Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ’s competitiveness against Japanese automakers. Sales at home fell 4 percent from a year earlier. The automaker in June started the planned increase in production of vehicles at its Gwangju factory. The output will be raised to 620,000 units from 500,000, enabling Kia to export more vehicles. Kia’s sales dropped 3.7 percent in Latin America, while industrywide deliveries in the region increased 7.9 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 9.1 percent in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding South Korea and China, according to company data on its website. Hyundai Motor, which owns 34 percent of Kia, yesterday reported second-quarter profit fell to 2.4 trillion won, beating the 2.37 trillion won average of 15 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg for 28 days.

Kia’s sales advanced 1.5 percent in Europe, led by sales of Sportage sport-utility vehicle and the new Cee’d hatchback. Industrywide deliveries in the region declined 4.1 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Higher Incentives Kia spent 19 percent more on incentive costs for passenger cars in the U.S. last quarter, according to Autodata. Its sales fell 0.2 percent last quarter, compared with the industrywide growth of 8.5 percent, according to company data. The won strengthened 2.4 percent against the yen last quarter, curbing Kia and Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ’s competitiveness against Japanese automakers. Sales at home fell 4 percent from a year earlier. The automaker in June started the planned increase in production of vehicles at its Gwangju factory. The output will be raised to 620,000 units from 500,000, enabling Kia to export more vehicles. Kia’s sales dropped 3.7 percent in Latin America, while industrywide deliveries in the region increased 7.9 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 9.1 percent in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding South Korea and China, according to company data on its website. Hyundai Motor, which owns 34 percent of Kia, yesterday reported second-quarter profit fell to 2.4 trillion won, beating the 2.37 trillion won average of 15 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg for 28 days.

GM to Ford Pension Gains Frees Cash for Fusion-Like Hits,['Craig Trudell'],2013-07-26 04:01:13,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/gm-to-ford-pension-gains-frees-cash-for-fusion-like-hits.html,"While drawing car buyers and praise from the likes of Consumer Reports, General Motors Co. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. are getting a grip on pensions that will free up cash to develop future hits. GM and Ford, burdened by some of the largest pension obligations among all U.S. companies, said this week they see significant improvement in their plans because of rising interest rates used to calculate the cost of future payments to retirees. When rates rise, the cost today of those promises declines. So pension shortfalls that were many years in the making can shrink without ever-larger payments by the companies. Over the long term, this should allow more spending on the core business and less on retirees. That in turn creates a brighter outlook for the companies, which are already delivering more competitive cars like the Chevrolet Impala and Ford Fusion, and better-than-estimated profits. “It’s one less thing investors have to worry about on the risk side,” said Michael Razewski, a New York-based principal at Douglas C. Lane & Associates, which oversees $3.1 billion, including Ford shares. “The less Ford has to focus on funding the pension, the more they can focus on driving innovative products and services and meeting customer demand.” Confounding Challenge GM and Ford have shelled out heavily for years to try to shore up their pensions, one of their most confounding challenges. Ford plans to make $5 billion in cash pension contributions this year, on top of $3.4 billion last year and $1.1 billion in 2011. This year’s payments are just shy of the $5.5 billion that Ford devoted to capital spending last year on everything from building factories to developing future cars and trucks. “We won’t have to allocate as much capital to pensions as we have the last couple of years and certainly this year,” Bob Shanks, chief financial officer of Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford, said during a July 24 conference call with analysts and reporters. “That will give us the ability to take the cash that we’re generating and invest it in other parts of the business that can support further growth.” Ford’s pension plans were underfunded by $18.7 billion last year. Only Detroit-based GM, with a shortfall of $27.8 billion, General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. had bigger holes at the end of 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “We’ve made good progress since the end of last year from a pension-funded position perspective, given the rise in interest rates that’s clearly helped our overall funding position,” GM CFO Dan Ammann told reporters yesterday. On a conference call with analysts, he said the stronger fund “gives us more rather than less flexibility.” $900 Million GM isn’t required to make any contributions to its U.S. plans this year, according to last year’s annual report. The company said it expects to pay in about $900 million anyway. Both automakers have taken big steps to contain their pension costs for salaried workers. A year ago, GM said it would spend as much as $4.5 billion to shift salaried retirees to a group annuity handled by a unit of Prudential Financial Inc. The annuity, and lump-sum buyout offers to 42,000 retirees, was forecast by GM to shave $26 billion from its pension load. Ford is also offering lump-sum buyouts to salaried retirees. The automaker has said it wants to eliminate remaining shortfalls in its pension funds by mid-decade. Fed Actions For several years, GM and Ford could blame Treasury yields, a benchmark in their pension calculation, for at least part of their shortfalls. Yields plunged after the 2008 financial crisis as the Federal Reserve embarked on unprecedented bond-purchase programs to lower borrowing costs and encourage spending. Interest rates have risen the last two months after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank may reduce its asset purchases this year and stop in the middle of 2014 if economic growth meets policy makers’ projections. The increase in rates will help reduce the funding needs at all types of pensions, whether run by corporations or governments. Detroit , long dubbed the Motor City, this month filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history and is struggling under a large unfunded pension obligation that could lead to benefit cuts for 30,000 current and former city workers. Though shortfalls can develop in the private sector, companies have stricter funding requirements than governments and pay into a federal insurance fund. ‘Best Year’ “If the year ended today, this would be the best year for funded status in the 13-year history of the Milliman Pension Funding Index,” said John Ehrhardt, a New York-based principal and consulting actuary for Milliman Inc., which tracks corporate pension performance. For GM, each increase of 1 percentage point in the discount rate cuts $8.76 billion from the present value of its U.S. pension obligation, according to its 2012 annual report. A similar increase would reduce Ford’s U.S. total obligation by $5.2 billion, its regulatory filing shows. Ford has seen a 70 to 80 basis-point rise in U.S. discount rates this year, Shanks said this week. An increase at the top of that range would narrow Ford’s pension gap by 42 percent to $10.8 billion by the end of this year, Matthew Stover, an auto analyst with Guggenheim Securities, wrote in a report yesterday. By 2015, GM may reduce its pension shortfall by 24 percent to $21 billion, Ryan Brinkman, a New York-based auto analyst for JPMorgan Chase & Co., estimated in a July 15 report. Pension Health The current value of promised future payments is only part of the total pension equation. The investment return is also important in assessing a plan’s health. GM and Ford have said they were trying to take some of the risk out of their plans by moving to a greater mix of fixed-income assets. It’s unclear whether higher rates might damp the returns on Ford’s and GM’s investments, said Brian Johnson, a Chicago-based auto analyst for Barclays Plc. “It depends on the extent to which they might reduce some of these long-dated bond holdings we believe they built up over the last couple years, which served them well when rates were falling,” he said in a telephone interview. Ford said this week that it expects to meet or exceed last year’s $8 billion in pretax profit, helped by the Fusion family car, which climbed to No. 7 in U.S. sales in the first half from outside the top 10 a year earlier, according to researcher Autodata Corp. Beating analyst estimates in its second-quarter profit, GM is riding one of the biggest waves of new models in its history. The redesigned Chevrolet Impala, among 18 new or refreshed GM vehicles arriving in U.S. showrooms this year, was rated by Consumer Reports yesterday as the best sedan on the market -- a first for a U.S. automaker in at least 20 years. “What’s so interesting about the automakers now is that they have started to really think about the business that they’re supposed to be doing,” Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst for Janney Capital Markets in Philadelphia, said by phone. “They can focus now on how to be the best in the actual business of auto-making.” To contact the reporter on this story: Craig Trudell in Southfield, Michigan at  ctrudell1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jamie Butters at  jbutters@bloomberg.net",['Craig Trudell'],"GM to Ford Pension Gains Frees Cash for Fusion-Like Hits While drawing car buyers and praise from the likes of Consumer Reports, General Motors Co.

"George Mitchell, Billionaire Behind Shale Boom, Dies at 94",['David Wethe' 'Joe Carroll'],2013-07-26 18:06:55,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/george-mitchell-billionaire-behind-u-s-shale-boom-dies-at-94.html,"George P. Mitchell, the Texas billionaire who pioneered shale-drilling techniques that triggered a renaissance in North American oil and natural gas production, has died. He was 94. He died today at his residence in the Tremont Hotel in Galveston, Texas, according to Franklin “Rusty” Carnes, at the Carnes Brothers Funeral Home in Galveston. He died of natural causes, his family said in a statement. Mitchell’s innovative use of horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing in the 1990s to release gas from a previously-impermeable rock formation near Fort Worth , Texas, earned him the nickname the “father of the Barnett Shale .” Those drilling breakthroughs revolutionized oil and gas exploration from Pennsylvania to Poland and the Yukon Territory to Argentina. “My engineers kept telling me, ‘You are wasting your money, Mitchell,” he told Forbes in 2009. “And I said, ‘Well damn it, let’s figure this thing out, because there is no question there is a tremendous source bed that’s about 250 feet thick.’” As other companies adopted Mitchell’s techniques, U.S. gas production rose 25 percent in the past decade, pushing prices to a 10-year low in April 2012. The nation now has an estimated 890 trillion cubic feet equivalent of recoverable natural gas, according to ITG Investment Research. That’s enough fuel for almost 40 years at current consumption rates. As the same methods were applied to oil fields , crude production has more than quadrupled in places such as the Bakken formation in North Dakota and Montana in the past three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries. Sold Company Mitchell sold his company, Mitchell Energy & Development Corp., to Devon Energy Corp. (DVN) in 2002 for about $3 billion, becoming one of the largest shareholders of the Oklahoma City-based gas and oil producer. Forbes magazine ranked him the 239th-richest American in 2012. The oilman focused on real estate earlier in his career, developing a suburb north of Houston out of 25,000 acres of pine forest. The Woodlands, which opened in 1974, now has a population of 100,000 and includes a mall, a 1.4-mile (2.3-kilometer) winding waterway and the 30-story headquarters of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. Exxon Mobil Corp., based in Irving, Texas, is building a 3 million-square-foot campus there. Mitchell sold the development in 1997 to a partnership of Crescent Real Estate Equities Co. and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund II. Showed ‘Guts’ Mitchell had the “guts” to do certain things that other people would be too scared to do, said Michael Richmond, who worked for Mitchell for 25 years, eventually retiring as chief executive officer of the real-estate company that developed The Woodlands. “George didn’t like to hear the answer, ‘No,’” Richmond said. “He always wanted to hear the answer, ‘How.’ You had to figure out solutions to any issue that was on the table.” “The Woodlands is a beautiful project,” Mitchell said in a March 2009 interview in his downtown Houston office. “But energy has been my background.” George Phydias Mitchell was born in Galveston on May 21, 1919. His parents, Mike and Katina Mitchell, who had come to the U.S. from Greece separately around 1900, ran a shoeshine parlor in Galveston. His father, soon after arriving in the U.S., took the name Mike Mitchell from an employer handing out paychecks who couldn’t say his real name, Savvas Paraskevopoulos, according to an article in the Houston Chronicle. Early Passion Mitchell developed a passion for oil and gas while working in the oil fields for his older brother, Johnny, around the age of 17. He graduated in 1940 with a degree in petroleum engineering and an emphasis in geology from the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, an institution now known as Texas A&M University , in College Station , Texas. After serving as a captain in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during World War II, Mitchell in 1946 joined a newly formed oil exploration company, Oil Drilling. That eventually became Mitchell Energy & Development Corp., which went public in 1972. Mitchell and his brother were early partners in the company. Mitchell participated in about 10,000 wells over his career. His company drilled its first well in the Barnett Shale in 1981 and developed fracturing and horizontal-drilling techniques to unlock gas trapped beneath hundreds of feet of rock, according to Mitchell’s company. In his late 80s, Mitchell turned his attention back to another shale play, this time bankrolling rigs in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania for a company headed by his son, Todd, and Joe Greenberg, a geologist. The Marcellus Shale has since emerged as the largest U.S. gas resource, holding the equivalent of 330 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas, according to ITG. Abundant Gas The new abundance of cheap gas transformed the U.S. industrial landscape, prompting new investment in power plants that use gas to generate electricity and accelerating the demise of older coal and nuclear plants that were more expensive to repair and operate. Chemical manufacturers including Exxon Mobil that use gas as the raw material for their products planned to build new plants in the U.S. to take advantage of the new resources. Pipeline networks to carry the newfound gas to market multiplied across the country. And gas drillers promoted natural gas powered trucks and cars for the nation’s highways and roads. Import facilities built earlier in the 2000’s, when concerns in the U.S. focused on dwindling oil and gas supplies, are now seeking to add export terminals to send U.S. gas overseas in the form of liquefied natural gas. ‘A Visionary’ “He was a visionary,” said James Rebello, who worked at Prudential Securities when it financed a small part of the exploration and production side of Mitchell’s group. Rebello and his colleagues told Mitchell they could lend him more if he combined the oil & gas business with the real estate unit. “But he was adamant that he wanted to keep those separate,” Rebello said. “He was right, and it worked out in the long run.” Mitchell donated more than $175 million, with the largest gifts going to Texas A&M , the University of Houston and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. A tennis center at Texas A&M bears his name. His wife, Cynthia, who died in 2009, helped develop the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion, an outdoor concert venue, in The Woodlands. In addition to his “great love” for The Woodlands, Richmond said, Mitchell had “an enormous passion” for his hometown of Galveston, Texas, where he bought and renovated older buildings in the downtown area. Mitchell met his wife while in the Army and married her in 1943. They had 10 children -- Pamela Maguire, Meredith Dreiss, Scott Mitchell, Sheridan Lorenz, Mark Mitchell , Kent Mitchell, Greg Mitchell, Kirk Mitchell, Todd Mitchell and Grant Mitchell.

Voluntourism in Bali as a Family Vacation,['Claire Shipman'],2013-07-26 17:13:14,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/voluntourism-in-bali-as-a-family-vacation.html,"My family decided to spend part of our summer holiday in Bali doing something “meaningful.” Yes we would lie in the sun, become acquainted with surfboards, tour temples and feed monkeys, but we would also explore a little known underbelly of the tropical paradise—rural mountain villages only just inching toward last century. Ideally we’d pitch in with some manual labor, spend time in the fledgling schools, do whatever needed to be done. It was difficult to plan, often enormously stressful, and not exactly what I expected. I crouch down to examine the dense goop, trying to spy some of the reportedly blissful worms, willing my nose to ignore the overwhelming stench. Next to me, my six-year-old daughter Della is happily digging in, using a trowel and a pitchfork to mix bucketfuls of cow dung and greens, oblivious to the brown spray landing on her clothes and mine. We are working to create a stinky mush that apparently no worm can resist. Which in turn becomes the ideal fertilizer to nourish the new crops the villagers here in a remote corner of Bali are working to grow. Meanwhile, Hugo, my nine-year-old is politely refusing to participate. Usually game to try anything, to bridge the most awkward social divides, this particular bridge is entirely unanticipated, and one too far. The intense wave of satisfaction I feel as I watch my daughter and her friend Ricky working alongside the giggling local kids, for whom the chore is routine, is not enough. Militant mom kicks in, squeezing Hugo’s arm and whispering an entirely improbable command: “Get down there an mix the poop. Now.” He does, but instead of feeling victorious, I find myself wondering, not for the first time, what we are doing. Why have we embarked on this expedition to a remote Balinese mountain village, carved into the crook of a volcano, far from sand or surf or anything resembling a typical family vacation? This is our first attempt at kid-sized “voluntourism.” Driven by the same impulse that sends so many adults off in search of meaningful travel, and that has created a burgeoning boutique tourist industry, I am eager to make a journey that will not just give me psychic satisfaction but that might nudge my kids toward being good little people, and perhaps, in years to come, even better big ones. So we, or rather I, decided to spend part of our exotic summer holiday doing something “meaningful.” Yes we would lie in the sun, become acquainted with surfboards, tour temples and feed monkeys, but we would also explore a little known underbelly of the tropical paradise—rural mountain villages only just inching toward last century. Ideally we’d pitch in with some manual labor, spend time in the fledgling schools, do whatever needed to be done. It was difficult to plan, often enormously stressful, and not exactly what I expected. Day one in Bali unfolds in a typical fashion. A long stop at legendary Kuta beach, where we happily ride the waves and a torrent of vendors hawk everything from beads to massages. At a bird park the exotic residents sit on our hands, peck our cheeks, and wow us with a dramatic unfurling of crayola-hued feathers. At our villa, we watch the locals engage in their uniquely Balinese, thrice-daily ritual, placing banana-leaf bowls full of rice, cookies flower petals and incense around the grounds. It’s an intricate but peaceful tableaux, meant to offer gratitude to the Hindu gods for good fortune. That night, as we prepare to journey up the mountain early the next morning, and try to get the children in a similar mindset. My friend Virginia and I talk with our kids (two of hers, Evie and Ricky, will join mine) about what to expect. We brainstorm with them about questions they might ask the Balinese children. “How do they like school now?” Evie wonders. “What is it like to be so poor—do your parents have enough money for food?” offers my daughter. That ignites a great debate about balancing candor with tact, which is never really resolved. We roust them out of a jet-lagged stupor at 5:30 in the morning, for a three-hour drive into the mountains. At our picture perfect villa near the beach, the parrots and finches have long been making a racket, and the nocturnal frogs were just diving for cover. We are laden with our own basic food supplies: Despite the apparent prosperity along Bali’s tourist coast, the region we are visiting is bitterly impoverished and I have a flash of my kids pleading for Oreos or chicken nuggets at inopportune moments. The scenes though our car windows of Balinese youngsters dodging motorbikes, navigating rice fields and skipping by temples on the way to school soon give way to more wild stretches of tropical greenery, sparkling in high definition, as we bump up into the mountains. The air is crisp as we emerge at the outpost of the East Bali Poverty Project, a world away from the sultry wrap of the tourist mecca down below. The rest of the ride up to the tiny mountain communities, in an old truck, on non-existent roads, is back-breaking. The kids like flying around, banging into the sides for a while, and we try to make a game of who acquires the most bruises. (Notions of western safety precautions like seatbelts, or even seats, are shelved.) Two of us are carsick and the others irritable after an hour. But once out of the truck, we were all enthralled again. You can’t really call Pengalusen a village. It’s essentially a rare bit of flat terrain, red-black dirt surrounded by ledges of palm trees and bamboo and verdant shrubbery folded into the mountainside. A neatly planted garden is visible in the distance. Thanks to the poverty project, the centerpiece is the new cement block school, which the community built three years ago. The children travel from their small bamboo shacks and the occasional brick homes dotting the mountain, some of them walking more than two hours each way. The classrooms are organized and inviting, with whitewashed walls, plenty of windows and impossibly eager students, each proudly dressed in a pastel-checked uniform (courtesy of a local clothing manufacturer.) In one room the older students are hard at work on a musical performance for the big Independence Day celebration. We are ushered into a room of younger students , who applaud our arrival. We join them on the floor, and our children read books back and forth with the local kids. We share the books we brought—some Dr. Seuss classics, some about North American animals, some about life in Washington, D.C. The unscripted Q&A is the highlight. Are there really more than 30 bathrooms in the White House? (My son Hugo had provided that bit of trivia, which transfixes the crowd for a long time.) How long does it take you to get to school, wonder the Balinese kids, who call out their own distances, ranging from 30 minutes to more than two hours. Our kids take that in, with a bit of shock, and suddenly try to be tactful. Hugo calculates that his school, if he were to walk, would be a few hours away. He doesn’t note that he’s never tried it. My daughter Della puffs up with pride that she actually asked a few questions (Are you happy to have a school now?) and is able to read a Mo Willems's “Elephant and Piggy” book, which turns out to be a surprisingly good cultural conduit, drawing laughs all around. Our two days there continue in the same bipolar vein. The intensity of our plunge into this entirely unfamiliar world means we are experiencing every connection and every frustration in Technicolor. After the poop stirring, we spread the mixture around one garden (with shovels), which prove much less gross and actually fun for the kids. And then they help harvest the carrots, the village kids laughing along with ours whenever they pull unripe specimens. I think our four actually felt useful. A simple trip to the bathroom, which is a hole in the ground behind a door and a great source of pride for the community, is a challenge for my daughter, even with my help. She ends up with wet pants and tears of humiliation. I am embarrassed at what I am sure must seem a high-class concern to the villagers, and guilty as I try to stifle her crying. But we both relax into laughter when one of the teachers relates a story about a tiny local child practically falling right into that hole. After a change of clothes, we are back on track. Like a lot of parents today, both my helicopter and tiger instincts run strong. I’m eager to give my kids opportunities, to show them the world, but am increasingly concerned they live in a cocoon of privilege. A few years ago my solution was to forgo vacation without an educational component. But it was one drizzly evening in London—after I had dispatched my husband and son on a forced march through the Churchill war rooms, as my daughter and I rushed off for a glimpse of Westminster Abbey, following a full morning for all of us at the Tower of London, on a day that started at 8 a.m. to squeeze everything in and still make the evening performance of a West End show meant to educate as well as entertain—when I realized, as we collapsed at our friend’s flat like bedraggled refugees, barely able to sort through everything we’d seen, that there has to be a better way to find resonance in our travels, for my children and for me. My goals were wrong, I realized. I don’t want to simply explore the exotic, or force-feed history. I want to nourish and nurture responsible people, who will grow up aware of the world’s challenges. Yes, I also value vacation time heavenly full of “nothing”—the sheer fun of play in the pool or on bikes or in a canoe. But if they are lucky enough to have the privilege of far-flung travel, I want my children to understand, first-hand, a fuller picture of human existence. And ideally, the fact of their own good fortune will simply seep in, instead of being hurled at them whenever I feel a lack of appreciation of their circumstances. Of course volunteering close to home is an easier lift in some ways, and more natural. The same impulses led me a few years ago to setting up a regular family service appointment at a homeless shelter, and that’s been moving and educational for all of us. But my gut told me an experience away from home, from our comfort zone, for at least a few days, might make a stronger impression, and allow us to really dig into a project and the culture. To be perfectly honest, I also thought it might assuage my own guilt about my own taste for luxurious globe-trotting. (Five years living and working abroad spoiled me, and now I find I can only truly relax when I hear the hum of a different language around me, or see the angles and shapes of another culture.) I started to research volunteer travel in earnest. While options for gown-ups and almost grown-ups were thick and intriguing, there was almost nothing I could find to accommodate, say, my saucy six-year old, who would benefit from a more realistic view of the world, but who might resist following some orders. Especially mine. And little demand either for nine-year olds, who might be recovering from post-computer-loss stress syndrome. And then, opportunity beckoned in the form of an invitation from friends to stay with them in Bali. I initially felt, for all of the above reasons, surprisingly reluctant to head off. A tropical Shangri-la just seemed—too much, too decadent—given the swaths of the the world my children have already seen at an absurdly young age. And the confusion, I found, extended to me, as I tried to imagine what we would do there, and somehow found the images of perfection—perfectly inadequate. But still…Bali! It was hard to spurn. I started digging, on my own, into whether the island might be able to offer us more than beaches and monkeys and the romantic third act of a best selling book. It turns out that the thriving tourist industry leaves much out of its brochures. The lush wonderland is also home to more than 200,000 Balinese living in extreme poverty, with little to no education, health care, or access to healthy food and water. Formal “voluntourism” hasn’t made its way to the island yet, but there are a few poverty relief programs, and one in particular sounded impressive. Perhaps worn down by my overtures, it was willing to accept the help of some eager adults and unwitting children. The East Bali Poverty Project was born in 1998 when David Booth, a British expat, uncovered the land that time forgot. Desa Ban sits in the east Bali mountains, straddling two volcanoes, one of which dropped loads of ash on the villages in 1963, increasing the inhospitality to crops. Until David intervened ten years ago, there were no roads, even rudimentary, and most of its 15,000 residents had never left their villages. Eighty-five percent of the locals suffered from illiteracy, goiters, and iodine deficiency. Cretinism, a condition stunting physical and mental growth, was rampant; infant mortality was 30 percent. There was not enough water, and most of it was not safe, and up to six hours by foot from the homes. Most insidious—the villagers lived almost exclusively on cassava, a root vegetable that was one of the few to take to the tough soil. But cassava, it turns out, increases iodine deficiency, and aggravates cretinism and mental retardation. It was an Indonesian Appalachia, times ten. Slowly, with the help of the project and David, who spends his days trolling for bags of cement, bolts of cloth, and donors with big hearts and loose change, the locals are embarking on small-step sustainable development. They’ve learned to mix cement and make rudimentary roads, build rain water collection tanks, tap into mountain springs, and nurture the soil to welcome other, healthier crops. And the centerpiece—schools. Six of them. An absolute novelty, and now the heart of every community, they are staffed with some outsiders, and many locals who have educated themselves, and then trained as teachers. As we made the 30-some hour journey to Bali, I have to admit the idea of our upcoming time in the village did give us all a sense of purpose. We had to hand-carry the two ukuleles we had bought for the villagers the entire trip, through a multitude of security devices and airports. Hugo and Della imbued them with enormous value—they were our offerings, of a sort, visible reminders of what we hoped to do on our mission. As it turns out, the musical slice of our venture is stirring beyond all expectations. The four kids hand over the bright blue and purple American ukuleles at the Pengalusan school to great oohs and ahhs. The village kids have all gathered to rehearse for a big Independence Day show, and they have loads of pointed questions about musical opportunities in the United States. Do our kids take lessons? Do they sing in school? Do they get to put on shows? They are thrilled to learn Hugo is part of a band. I try to impress the concept of amateur upon them, but I’m not sure it takes. Until five years ago, the Desa Ban children have never played any instruments, or even done any singing to speak of, or had much of a chance to hear any music. Feeding of the soul had, for obvious reasons, not been a priority. Now, armed with recorders, some inexpensive microphones, visiting music teachers, and a natural craving for artistic nourishment, they are making glorious noise. They also finally have access to modern world inspiration through a few CD players and radios. A few of the girls sing throaty, melancholy tunes, which I imagine to be traditional Balinese laments. Hugo asks what they were about. Pop songs, they say, about bad boyfriends. That creates a true bridge of understanding, if ever there was one, and the dusty cement terrace erupts in laughter. Della offers a universal nose crinkle at the notion of singing about boyfriends. But Evie, 9 going on 15, smiles. Hugo and Ricky then get pulled into a local monkey dance by a mischievous ten-year-old girl, to great hoots and howls. They pick up the exotic and slightly seductive arm movements with surprising accuracy and glee. It is an unforgettable moment that turns out to be the highlight of our trip. The mountains and coconut palm trees are suddenly sparkling, the sea of uniforms are crisp with starched pride, and the sense of what has been accomplished in this tiny corner of the universe radiates in the astonishingly beautiful and fervent faces of the Balinese children. And truly unexpected, in midst of lives of such poverty, lives so different from ours, there is a palpable measure of hope and joy universal to all children when nurtured. At that moment my kids stop feeling like they are seeing an alien life-style, on a mission to help people truly different. They just start to have fun, and to a small extent, to bond with their kindred spirits. And I also think, at that moment, that the Balinese kids believe the world at large is not so far away or so foreign. And that they are part of it. We learn that the project is helping people connect to the outside world, too. The biggest donors, hotel managers largely, are heavily engaged—not just financially, but in watching the progress of the kids. Several recent high-school graduates have been offered low level hotel jobs already. David tells us candidly that for decades the relatively wealthy tourism industry had no interest in getting involved with local issues on the island. That’s changed, as world-wide expectations about corporate responsibility have increased. But there are limits. Ever ambitious, David asked the general manager of one swanky hotel chain, which has been a donor, if he would consider placing tasteful literature about the East Bali Poverty Project in the guest rooms. Perhaps, David reasoned, the tourists might want to contribute in some way to the island they are visiting. Absolutely not, he was told. The guests are here to relax, to escape. They would not want to think about anything uncomfortable or disturbing on their holiday. That had certainly always been my vision of a vacation. Sheer diversion. And there were moments in planning our Bali sojourn, and in experiencing it, that I thought it seemed more work than holiday. Hard work actually. It was an exhausting and dirty few days. We were dust covered, hungry, tired, and honestly, relieved to get back to our pretty villa in the south and resume our slow, sun-filled days. We toured temples, fed monkeys, and even witnessed a cremation. Bali is nothing if not exotic. But somehow, we all knew we’d already seen the most memorable. The combination of traditional holiday and volunteer travel fit just right—we appreciated our more cushy trappings, and put them into perspective with plenty of rich discussions. And I therefore relaxed on holiday the way I hadn’t in years. I just didn’t care about rushing around and seeing every site—I knew I’d already done what I came for. I had created a window onto the culture that I never could have achieved through traditional tourism. One night we watched a professional monkey dance—a staple for tourists. My kids pronounced they preferred the village show. “We knew the people performing, Mom,” my daughter explained. Back home, our exotic summer holiday, as is usually the case, took up residence more permanently on iPhoto than in our minds. Still, there were unexpected indications that the journey has taken root even deeper than I imagined. Digging rocks out of the mud in our backyard one day, my six-year-old suddenly paused, awestruck still as she contemplated what constitutes typical fun for her counterparts in the tiny Balinese hamlet of Desa Ban. “Remember, Mom, how in that poor village they don’t have any TV but they get to wrestle in the mud?” For his fourth grade “Chinese Moon Festival,” my son dug out a small painting one of the local Balinese children had labored over, and explained to his class how the kids there celebrate a full moon. He went on to talk about how there were “no schools or art in those villages” before the East Bali Poverty Project was started. I savored those little victories, but was realistic about what we had actually contributed to the villagers. Not much in terms of real work, certainly. My expectations on that level for my kids may have been too high. I came away understanding I have to think small, or smaller, perhaps. And then they surprised me. Months later, our families were debating how to best keep in touch, whether we could send letters or help, when the kids proposed a lemonade stand to raise money for uniforms. They’d remembered what a point of pride the uniforms had been for the children, and that the incoming kindergarten class wouldn’t have them. Virginia and I were skeptical about who would really do the work, and what the haul would be, but we fought our urge to suggest something more “creative.” Back on their own turf, our kids were sure-footed, and clearly inspired. They copied pictures of the villagers and turned them into captivating signs detailing the cause in blunt, elementary school terms, and blanketed the neighborhood. They then added a snow cone machine, a blow-up water slide, and, with youthful chutzpa, charged people a fortune for a good cause. It helped that we were in the middle of a heat wave and rolling power outages. Counting the money that night was a gleeful affair. “It’s more than enough for the uniforms,” Ricky declared. They had raised a startling amount. Parental expressions must have looked shocked, because we’d promised, naively, to match their funds. They started giggling, and soon we were all laughing, and debating how to best get the money to a remote Balinese village that, months ago, we’d never even heard of. We’d all taken a journey so much farther than I’d ever anticipated. More From Condé Nast Traveler:",['Claire Shipman'],"Voluntourism in Bali as a Family Vacation My family decided to spend part of our summer holiday in Bali doing something “meaningful.” Yes we would lie in the sun, become acquainted with surfboards, tour temples and feed monkeys, but we would also explore a little known underbelly of the tropical paradise—rural mountain villages only just inching toward last century. Ideally we’d pitch in with some manual labor, spend time in the fledgling schools, do whatever needed to be done. It was difficult to plan, often enormously stressful, and not exactly what I expected. I crouch down to examine the dense goop, trying to spy some of the reportedly blissful worms, willing my nose to ignore the overwhelming stench. Next to me, my six-year-old daughter Della is happily digging in, using a trowel and a pitchfork to mix bucketfuls of cow dung and greens, oblivious to the brown spray landing on her clothes and mine. We are working to create a stinky mush that apparently no worm can resist. Which in turn becomes the ideal fertilizer to nourish the new crops the villagers here in a remote corner of Bali are working to grow. Meanwhile, Hugo, my nine-year-old is politely refusing to participate. Usually game to try anything, to bridge the most awkward social divides, this particular bridge is entirely unanticipated, and one too far. The intense wave of satisfaction I feel as I watch my daughter and her friend Ricky working alongside the giggling local kids, for whom the chore is routine, is not enough. Militant mom kicks in, squeezing Hugo’s arm and whispering an entirely improbable command: “Get down there an mix the poop. Now.” He does, but instead of feeling victorious, I find myself wondering, not for the first time, what we are doing. Why have we embarked on this expedition to a remote Balinese mountain village, carved into the crook of a volcano, far from sand or surf or anything resembling a typical family vacation? This is our first attempt at kid-sized “voluntourism.” Driven by the same impulse that sends so many adults off in search of meaningful travel, and that has created a burgeoning boutique tourist industry, I am eager to make a journey that will not just give me psychic satisfaction but that might nudge my kids toward being good little people, and perhaps, in years to come, even better big ones. So we, or rather I, decided to spend part of our exotic summer holiday doing something “meaningful.” Yes we would lie in the sun, become acquainted with surfboards, tour temples and feed monkeys, but we would also explore a little known underbelly of the tropical paradise—rural mountain villages only just inching toward last century.

David tells us candidly that for decades the relatively wealthy tourism industry had no interest in getting involved with local issues on the island. That’s changed, as world-wide expectations about corporate responsibility have increased. But there are limits. Ever ambitious, David asked the general manager of one swanky hotel chain, which has been a donor, if he would consider placing tasteful literature about the East Bali Poverty Project in the guest rooms. Perhaps, David reasoned, the tourists might want to contribute in some way to the island they are visiting. Absolutely not, he was told. The guests are here to relax, to escape. They would not want to think about anything uncomfortable or disturbing on their holiday. That had certainly always been my vision of a vacation. Sheer diversion. And there were moments in planning our Bali sojourn, and in experiencing it, that I thought it seemed more work than holiday. Hard work actually. It was an exhausting and dirty few days. We were dust covered, hungry, tired, and honestly, relieved to get back to our pretty villa in the south and resume our slow, sun-filled days. We toured temples, fed monkeys, and even witnessed a cremation. Bali is nothing if not exotic. But somehow, we all knew we’d already seen the most memorable. The combination of traditional holiday and volunteer travel fit just right—we appreciated our more cushy trappings, and put them into perspective with plenty of rich discussions. And I therefore relaxed on holiday the way I hadn’t in years. I just didn’t care about rushing around and seeing every site—I knew I’d already done what I came for. I had created a window onto the culture that I never could have achieved through traditional tourism. One night we watched a professional monkey dance—a staple for tourists. My kids pronounced they preferred the village show. “We knew the people performing, Mom,” my daughter explained. Back home, our exotic summer holiday, as is usually the case, took up residence more permanently on iPhoto than in our minds. Still, there were unexpected indications that the journey has taken root even deeper than I imagined. Digging rocks out of the mud in our backyard one day, my six-year-old suddenly paused, awestruck still as she contemplated what constitutes typical fun for her counterparts in the tiny Balinese hamlet of Desa Ban. “Remember, Mom, how in that poor village they don’t have any TV but they get to wrestle in the mud?” For his fourth grade “Chinese Moon Festival,” my son dug out a small painting one of the local Balinese children had labored over, and explained to his class how the kids there celebrate a full moon. He went on to talk about how there were “no schools or art in those villages” before the East Bali Poverty Project was started. I savored those little victories, but was realistic about what we had actually contributed to the villagers. Not much in terms of real work, certainly. My expectations on that level for my kids may have been too high. I came away understanding I have to think small, or smaller, perhaps. And then they surprised me. Months later, our families were debating how to best keep in touch, whether we could send letters or help, when the kids proposed a lemonade stand to raise money for uniforms. They’d remembered what a point of pride the uniforms had been for the children, and that the incoming kindergarten class wouldn’t have them. Virginia and I were skeptical about who would really do the work, and what the haul would be, but we fought our urge to suggest something more “creative.” Back on their own turf, our kids were sure-footed, and clearly inspired. They copied pictures of the villagers and turned them into captivating signs detailing the cause in blunt, elementary school terms, and blanketed the neighborhood. They then added a snow cone machine, a blow-up water slide, and, with youthful chutzpa, charged people a fortune for a good cause. It helped that we were in the middle of a heat wave and rolling power outages. Counting the money that night was a gleeful affair. “It’s more than enough for the uniforms,” Ricky declared. They had raised a startling amount. Parental expressions must have looked shocked, because we’d promised, naively, to match their funds. They started giggling, and soon we were all laughing, and debating how to best get the money to a remote Balinese village that, months ago, we’d never even heard of. We’d all taken a journey so much farther than I’d ever anticipated. More From Condé Nast Traveler:",21809,3761,-1
Toyota Outsold by GM Signals Long-Term Japan Demand Slump,['Anna Mukai' 'Yuki Hagiwara' 'Ma Jie'],2013-07-28 09:01:18,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/gm-outsold-toyota-last-quarter-to-climb-atop-car-industry.html,"(Corrects Nissan’s reporting date in story published July 27.) Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) is facing a Japan problem. The company, based in Toyota City, Japan, was outsold by General Motors Co. (GM) for the first time in six quarters, as deliveries in Japan extended their decline after government incentives for fuel-efficient models expired last year. Toyota and its subsidiaries sold 2.48 million vehicles during the quarter ended June, just shy of the 2.49 million that Detroit-based GM disclosed earlier this month. Japan’s largest automaker sold 8.4 percent fewer vehicles in its home market last quarter. Toyota’s decline in Japan car sales shows a rare weak spot for a company that’s forecasting its biggest profit in six years and whose stock has gained 54 percent this year. Japanese vehicle sales have fallen steadily since the asset bubble burst in 1989, with temporary boosts from government subsidies. “The decline in Japan will continue,” said Jun Nokuo, an analyst with researcher R.L. Polk & Co. in Tokyo. “It is an aging society and the population is shrinking. At the same time, the popularity of cars is declining because public transportation is easy to use.” Toyota’s sales in the first six months of this year dropped 1.2 percent to 4.91 million units. GM sold 4.85 million vehicles in the first half and Volkswagen delivered 4.7 million, according to the companies. 10 Million Toyota has been projecting since late December that sales will climb to almost 10 million units -- a milestone no automaker has ever breached -- in 2013. Japan’s largest manufacturer has an ever bigger buffer in the yen, whose decline has been bolstering the value of Japanese exports. Toyota, which reports earnings on Aug. 2, probably saw profit last quarter surge 48 percent to the highest in more than five years, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. The yen has weakened more than 12 percent against the dollar this year and this week traded at 100 versus the greenback. The Japanese currency may weaken to 105 in the fourth quarter, according to the median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Separately, Toyota said July 26 it will further expand its Princeton, Indiana, auto-assembly plant, investing $30 million to boost Highlander sport-utility vehicle production by a further 15,000 units a year from 2014. The plant will also hire 200 more workers, said Carri Chandler, a spokeswoman said. Price Cuts Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , which this week reported a 14 percent increase in profit, has taken advantage of favorable exchange rates by cutting prices of seven models in the U.S., including its top-selling Altima sedan. Nissan, Japan’s second-largest carmaker, saw deliveries surge 20 percent last quarter. Toyota has resisted following Nissan’s price cuts and saw its sales in the country rise by 3.7 percent -- less than half the pace of the industry -- and its U.S. market share fell to the lowest in five quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At GM, 18 new or refreshed vehicles are being brought into showrooms this year, transforming its lineup into one of the market’s newest from one of the oldest. One of the earliest new offerings, the 2014 Impala, was rated by Consumer Reports as the best sedan on the market -- a first for a GM U.S. automaker in at least 20 years. The product push is part of Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson’s efforts to boost North American profit margins to 10 percent, stem European losses and increase China sales to 5 million, all by mid-decade. GM’s rise to the top of the global industry caps a week in which the maker of Chevrolet cars and Ford Motor Co. (F) posted earnings that beat analyst estimates. China Market In China, where a territorial dispute led to a consumer backlash that cut demand for Japanese products last year, Toyota continued to lose market share to GM and Volkswagen. Toyota’s deliveries climbed 0.6 percent last quarter, versus GM’s 12 percent and Volkswagen’s 16 percent, according to figures reported by the companies. Demand for Japanese products in China , the world’s largest auto market, is recovering from last year and Toyota is targeting this year’s deliveries to rise to at least 900,000 units, up about 7 percent from 2012. In Europe , where auto demand is slumping to its lowest level in two decades, sales of Toyota and Lexus cars last quarter were little changed from a year earlier, reaching 215,734 units. That helped the company keep its market share at about 4.5 percent, according to the company. Toyota, GM In 2008, Toyota ended GM’s 77-year reign as the world’s largest automaker, holding on to the top annual sales spot until 2011, when it surrendered the title after production was disrupted by natural disasters in Japan and Thailand. Sales rebounded in 2012, allowing the Japanese automaker to deliver 9.75 million units and regain its global No. 1 title as the recession receded, while the carmaker added products and was spared from disruptions from natural disasters. “The fight between GM, Toyota and VW will be long and hard fought,” said Alec Gutierrez, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “It will be the manufacturer that is best able to deliver high quality, affordable, fuel-efficient transportation to the masses that will ultimately own the global sales race.” To contact the reporters on this story: Anna Mukai in Tokyo at  amukai1@bloomberg.net ; Yuki Hagiwara in Tokyo at  yhagiwara1@bloomberg.net ; Ma Jie in Tokyo at  jma124@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at  ycho2@bloomberg.net",['Anna MukaiYuki HagiwaraMa Jie'],"Toyota Outsold by GM Signals Long-Term Japan Demand Slump (Corrects Nissan’s reporting date in story published July 27.)

(9101) , Japan ’s biggest shipping line, and eight other maritime-car transporters were accused in a lawsuit by a Florida-based shipping company of fixing prices on carrier services. Manaco International Forwarder Inc. contends officials of Nippon Yusen and other car transporters, such as Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107) and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104) , violated U.S. antitrust laws by conspiring to “fix, stabilize or maintain prices of” their services, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan. The conspiracy caused Ft. Lauderdale, Florida-based Manaco and other shipping clients to “pay artificially inflated prices” to have cars delivered, the company said in the complaint. Manaco is seeking to have the case certified as a class action, or group, lawsuit. The suit follows raids by Japanese antitrust regulators last year at the offices of Nippon Yusen and four other shipping lines that control about 70 percent of the global market for carrying cars. The companies said the search was in connection with a probe of price-fixing claims. Jiro Tanida, a Nippon Yusen spokesman, Jitsuo Narita, a spokesman for Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., and Yasuyuki Fukuma, a Mitsui O.S.K. spokesman, couldn’t be immediately reached for comment on the suit yesterday in Japan. ‘Highly Concentrated’ Manaco contends the car-shipping companies operate in a “highly concentrated industry,” where companies all operate the same kind of “Roll-on/Roll-off” ships. The defendants sued in the case comprise the five largest companies based on capacity, according to court filings. Even though the industry has faced a glut of transport capacity over the years, prices have remained stable or increased, Manaco said in its complaint.

Status Takes Back Seat as Crisis Favors Dacia Over Ford,['Christian Wuestner'],2012-11-12 23:00:51,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/status-takes-back-seat-as-crisis-favors-dacia-over-ford.html,"Wolfgang Hirschauer, a toolmaker from the Bavarian ski town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, this year traded in his Renault (RNO) Espace minivan for a Dacia Logan, a budget wagon that retails for a quarter the price. “I was looking for a car for transportation only,” said the 58-year-old father of three. “I liked the low cost and the basic features,” including easy-to-fix mechanics, which made up for the lack of frills like electric windows. Hirschauer’s choice is part of a broad back-to-basics thriftiness in crisis-strapped Europe. While austerity measures have helped accelerate the trend, the rise of budget vehicles reflects a deeper shift in European attitudes as cars lose their importance as a status symbol. “Automobiles are not a show-off item anymore,” said Arnaud Deboeuf, a director at Renault SA, which owns Dacia. “People prefer investing in iPads or smartphones over cars.” After acquiring Dacia in 1998, Renault intended to use the Romanian automaker to attract first-time buyers in Eastern Europe and other emerging markets. Following the Logan’s introduction in 2004, that plan changed as western Europeans began buying the cars in the East and bringing them back home. Backed by a no-discount policy, Dacia’s advance is helping Renault weather Europe’s downturn by providing stable profit margins as the flagship brand comes under pressure, said Erich Hauser, an analyst with Credit Suisse in London. Renault posted an operating profit margin of 2.5 percent in the first half even as mass-market rivals struggle with losses in Europe. Budget Brands Sales of low-cost brands such as Dacia, Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Skoda, and Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ’s Kia have climbed 16 percent since car sales in Europe peaked in 2007. Over the same period, industrywide deliveries have plunged 21 percent, according to researcher IHS Automotive. Budget brands will account for 8.3 percent of the market this year, compared with 5.7 percent five years ago as they nab customers from mid-market nameplates like PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) , Fiat SpA (F) and General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Opel. “The middle class in Europe is shrinking due to the sovereign-debt crisis, reducing demand for cars in the mid- priced segment,” said Albrecht Denninghoff , analyst at Silvia Quandt Research in Frankfurt. “There are too many carmakers competing in the segment, where capacity needs to be reduced.” To diminish the risk of getting squeezed out of the market, Volkswagen and Ford Motor Co. (F) are mulling new budget models. Family Model VW is considering a no-frills line that would harken back to basic vehicles from the 60s and 70s, before cars were ubiquitous in Europe and families pulled together to buy one. It was a time when “grandma helped pay, so she got a seat in the back,” Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn said at the Sao Paulo Motor Show last month. The new line could be a similar all-round vehicle for “people who want to transport grandpa, grandma and the kids around.” The cars would be about 4 meters (13 feet) long -- roughly the size of the Golf hatchback -- and cost less than 8,000 euros, at least 20 percent cheaper than VW’s current entry-level Up! city car, he said. Ford CEO Alan Mulally said his company is “evaluating a budget car” that might be sold under a separate nameplate. “I am just not sure if we can do that with our Ford brand,” Mulally said at a Nov. 7 industry conference in Berlin. Such a move could help the U.S. automaker shore up its flagging European operations as it prepares to shut 3 of its 13 factories in the region by 2014. Purchasing Power While Ford and VW deliberate, Dacia is revamping its lineup. It introduced new versions of the Sandero hatchback and the Logan in September. The cars boast more rugged frames, side airbags and better sound-proofing. The brand, which promotes its cars as “function over frivolity,” expanded to five vehicles by adding the Lodgy and Dokker vans this year. The primary impetus for the shift is that incomes haven’t grown as fast as the cost of transport. A new car cost an average German worker 16 months’ pay last year, versus 9.4 months in 1980, according to the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen. “Cars are now too expensive for many people, a fact that many automakers have ignored,” said Juergen Pieper , analyst at Bankhaus Metzler in Frankfurt. VW’s Skoda, which attempted to shift upscale with the Superb sedan in 2008, is returning to its roots as a value brand. The Czech carmaker, whose motto is “simply clever,” started selling the new Rapid sedan last month at a base price of 13,990 euros, undercutting the similarly sized Renault Fluence by 7,500 euros and the Ford Mondeo by 9,960 euros. ‘Something That Moves’ Still, Skoda can’t compete with Dacia on price. The Renault brand’s cheapest model, the Sandero, starts at 6,790 euros, thanks to its reliance on cheap labor in Romania and Morocco. Skoda claims its quality and features justify the premium, even in this price-sensitive segment. Being cheap hasn’t turned off customers like Tomas Luenser. The 37-year-old industrial mechanic from Berlin swapped his VW Passat (PSAT) for a Dacia Duster sport-utility vehicle in October 2010 because of the price and the ample space for his kids. Image wasn’t part of the equation. “Earlier it was important to drive a VW and show that you had something, but now we just want a vehicle that moves,” said the father of three. “I’ve noticed that Dacia owners spend a lot less time washing their cars.

Europe Gives Greece 2 More Years to Reach Deficit Targets,['James G.Neuger' 'Jonathan Stearns'],2012-11-13 13:32:31,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/europe-gives-greece-2-more-years-to-reach-deficit-debt-targets.html,"Euro finance chiefs left unanswered how they’ll fill a fresh hole in Greece’s balance sheet without tapping their own bailout-weary taxpayers for money after giving the country two extra years to trim its budget deficit. In the latest compromise in three years of crisis fighting, creditors led by Germany opted late yesterday to keep money flowing to Greece instead of risking a default that could lead to the nation’s exit from the euro and stir more turmoil for the countries that remain in the single-currency bloc. Greece has made “far-reaching decisions that go in the right direction,” German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told reporters in Brussels today. He said Greece’s aid program can be re-engineered to plug a financing gap of as much as 32.6 billion euros ($41 billion) without costing creditors a cent. Prospects of a funding deal at a hastily scheduled Nov. 20 meeting were clouded by objections from the International Monetary Fund , which took issue with the ministers’ decision to postpone the goal of getting Greece’s debt down to a “sustainable” level of 120 percent of gross domestic product by two years to 2022. Market reaction was mixed. The euro and Greek bonds initially fell on concern that Greece ’s financing dilemma would defy quick solutions. The market rebounded after Bild reported that Germany favors speeding planned future loan payouts. Spain ’s bonds fell after Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said there was no discussion of a Spanish bailout last night. ‘Different Views’ Managing Director Christine Lagarde left open whether the IMF, provider of about a third of 148.6 billion euros in loans funnelled to Greece since 2010, will maintain its lending after the euro-area ministers consented to higher Greek debt for a longer period and ruled out a write-off of official debt. “Debt sustainability of Greece has to be measured in 2020,” said Lagarde, who was French finance minister when the crisis started. “We clearly have different views. What matters at the end of the day is the sustainability of the Greek debt.” The Europe-IMF rift was played down by Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker , who chaired last night’s meeting. In an interview in Hingene, Belgium today, Juncker said there is “no real dispute” and he’s “confident that the IMF will stay on board.” Dominant Lender The extra financing need was triggered by a decision to give Greece two more years, until 2016, to cut the deficit to 2 percent of GDP. Refusal by the IMF to pitch in would increase the cost for European governments, led by Germany, the dominant lender to Greece and three other countries -- Ireland, Portugal and Spain -- that have fallen back on international aid. For now, Schaeuble said the terms of the Greek package can be rejiggered by cutting the rates on bailout loans or giving Greece extra time to pay them back, without requiring creditors to put up more loans or write off parts of Greece’s official debt. “Our assumption is that the program is working so that in the end, it’s a matter of guarantees and not benefits for Greece,” Schaeuble said. Write-offs are a legal and political taboo for German Chancellor Angela Merkel , running for re-election in late 2013 with the argument that her anti-crisis prescriptions are working and unwilling to call on the German parliament to authorize more money. Fiscal Math Greece’s loan rates have been cut and maturities extended twice before. Schaeuble characterized the resulting cost to creditors as a reduction in profit. He said other, as yet undisclosed, steps can be taken to make the Greek fiscal math add up. Bild newspaper reported that Germany favors speeding the delivery of previously approved payments to Greece, increasing the next installment to 44 billion euros from 31.5 billion euros. The search for a solution will run in parallel with parliamentary debates in countries such as Germany, Finland and the Netherlands, three countries that have handed control over bailout policy to lawmakers concerned about throwing good money after bad. Luxembourg’s Juncker predicted a “definite decision” next week on releasing the next aid payment. He said the ministers might have to consult once more, possibly by teleconference, by the end of November to formally sign off on the updated rescue package. ‘Done Deal’ The likely outcome is “a typical euro-zone fudge,” said Carsten Brzeski , an economist at ING Group NV in Brussels. “Needless to say, the final decision on the next Greek tranche, a new financing gap and debt sustainability will not be the end of the matter.” Economically and politically, the European commitment marked a triumph for Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, who in power has whipped through the same budget-cutting policies that he was against while in opposition in order to keep Greece in the euro. “It’s a done deal,” Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said. “It’s very important.” In a report presented to the ministers, praise for Greece’s savings measures and economic shakeup blended with concern that “vested interests” and “powerful pressure groups” will frustrate the reforms. Demonstrations and strikes have blunted past revamp efforts, and 15,000 people protested outside parliament in Athens two nights ago against the passage of an austerity budget for 2013. ‘Key Risks’ “The key risks concern the overall policy implementation, given that the coalition supporting the government appears fragile and some components of the program face political resistance, despite the determination of the government,” said the report by the “troika” made up of the European Commission, European Central Bank and IMF. In the meantime, Greece will escape a default on Nov. 16 when 5 billion euros in treasury bills come due. Greek banks will be able to roll over their bill holdings, saving the country from the “financing cliff,” European Union Economic and Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn said. Greece sold 4 billion euros of bills today. To contact the reporters on this story: James G.

"Fruity Margarita Tasting Results in Many Drinks, Long Day",['John Mariani'],2012-11-12 03:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/fruity-margarita-tasting-results-in-many-drinks-long-day.html,"When was the last time someone offered you a creme de menthe, you know, the one that turns your teeth bright green? Never? I’m not surprised, since liqueurs, or cordials, are not as high on most people’s list of after-dinner drinks as they were when ladies retired to one room and men to another. But a slew of apple, chocolate, even chili-based liqueurs are now appearing in the market, fueled by bartenders crafting high-end cocktails. “These products are popping up in new cocktails because they add novelty without upping the alcohol too much,” says Rachel Burkons, senior editor of the industry magazine The Tasting Panel. (Most liqueurs range from 15 to 30 percent alcohol.) Yet the category is still led by orange liqueurs, with plenty of competition capitalizing on the soaring popularity of premium margaritas, which also drives the sales of high-end tequilas. According to the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. , sales of “high end” tequilas rose 14.6 percent, “super premium”, 11.3 percent and “pre-mixed cocktails” with tequila 12.2 percent in 2011. Premium Tequilas Mexico ’s Patron is now making a Citronge liqueur to add to its line of premium tequilas, albeit at a high 40 percent alcohol. Cognac maker Pierre Ferrand is trying to carve a niche in the market with a “ancienne methode” Dry Curacao, which is not so sweet and uses Ferrand’s fine cognacs instead of basic brandy. “A margarita has two iconic ingredients, tequila and orange liqueur, and people have gotten very well versed in them,” says Sean Beck, beverage director at Hugo’s Mexican restaurant in Houston. “The orange liqueur segment has really grown up, and I match the specific tequila, we have 60, to a specific liqueur, like mixing a soft resposado tequila with Grand Marnier (MALA) or Royal Combier , both with a cognac base.” Hugo’s does not even make frozen margaritas, which Beck says is just a way for a bar to extend profit margins. “That cold ice just masks the taste and aroma of the spirits, so they use cheap Triple Sec,” he says. Choosy Drinkers Bar chef Abigail Gullo of the new SoBou bar-restaurant in New Orleans says customers are very specific about the orange liqueur they want in margaritas and other cocktails. “With premium margaritas, cosmos and sidecars, you need top ingredients like Cointreau and Grand Marnier, which people request by name. There’s also a big resurgence of those Polynesian-style tiki cocktails like mai tais that require orange liqueur.” At SoBou (short for South of Bourbon Street) the newest featured cocktail is the New Orleans Yacht Club, made with three kinds of rum, falernum, lime juice and curacao orange liqueur. I myself swear by Cointreau, now owned by Remy Martin. It was created in 1875 by Edouard Cointreau in Angers, France , using sweet and bitter orange peels. (Many liqueur makers just use orange flavoring.) Once, on a tour of the Cointreau distillery (open to the public by appointment), I could clearly smell the different perfumes in the various orange peels, dried before distillation. Today Cointreau sells 13 million bottles a year, in more than 150 countries. Grand Marnier What I love about Cointreau is that it is bittersweet and shows itself in a mixed drink as more than orange-flavored sugar. On its own, poured over crushed ice, it is a superb after-dinner drink, as is Grand Marnier, created in 1880 by Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle using cognac, orange essence and sugar. Yet though they blend impeccably in cocktails, these two products are expensive. Cointreau is about $35, Grand Marnier about $40. (Premium bottlings of these same liqueurs cost much more.) So I assembled a range of orange liqueurs, some new to the market, and tasted them on their own and in margaritas. It made for a long afternoon. Here’s my report. Mathilde Grande XO ($22). This is another, somewhat cheaper Ferrand Cognac product from their Dry Curacao, and you can smell and taste the brandy, with 40 percent alcohol. It has a fine bitterness upfront that gives way to a cream sweetness, then ends with a light sting of heat. Patron Citronge ($24). I was surprised this came across with so much sweetness, perhaps made on the belief that Americans prefer candy-like spirits. It’s rather like an orange Creamsicle, which would not be my first choice in a mixed drink. DeKuyper 03 Premium ($25). Made from Brazilian pera oranges by one of the leading cordial producers, begun in Holland in 1695, John DeKuyper & Sons , this is a crystal-clear liqueur with a pleasant, light citrus nose and, beneath a thick mantle of sweetness, a good dose of orange flavor that goes well with a basic blanco tequila or most mixed drinks. Stock Orange Gran Gala ($21). Made with VSOP brandy, this has a lovely caramel orange color, but its bouquet smells and tastes medicinal, with a chemical aftertaste. Solerno Blood Orange ($30). This Sicilian bottling has plenty of Italian style, starting with the gorgeous, punted, slim-necked scarlet bottle and the fact that it’s made from blood oranges. But the liquid is clear and colorless, the aroma quite refined and the taste unique, with a berry-like flavor, medium sweetness and a faint, pleasing burn. Its bitter component keeps it clean and makes this an excellent, slightly cheaper alternative to Cointreau. (John Mariani writes about wine for Muse, the arts and culture section of Bloomberg News.

Firm News Mattos Filho Takes Top M&A Legal-Adviser Rank: Corporate Brazil  The top-ranked law firm for mergers and acquisitions in Brazil this year is Mattos Filho, Veiga Filho, Marrey Jr. & Quiroga Advogados after it helped complete more buyout-fund transactions than any other legal adviser. Mattos Filho handled deals totaling $14.3 billion this year through Nov. 8, giving it 27 percent of the market and propelling it past 2011’s leader, Barbosa Mussnich & Aragao, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Sao Paulo-based firm advised on eight of the 64 transactions involving buyout funds so far this year. “Increasing competition for deals between private-equity funds has kept us working a lot,” Joao Ricardo de Azevedo Ribeiro, a senior partner at Mattos Filho, said in an interview. He credited the firm’s New York office for winning assignments on international buyouts. Estok Comercio & Representacoes Ltda., owner of the Tok&Stok chain of furniture stores, hired Mattos Filho to advise on its sale of a 60 percent stake to Carlyle Group LP (CG) for 700 million reais ($343 million). The law firm also advised London- based private-equity company Actis LLP on its pending 180 million-real purchase of Cruzeiro do Sul Educacional, a Sao Paulo-based for-profit university. Private-equity funds participated in 64 M&A transactions in Brazil, or 12 percent of the 552 deals so far this year. That’s up from 57 deals, or 9.6 percent, of the 596 transactions announced in the same period of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mattos Filho and Pinheiro Neto tied for first place based on the number of deals, with 37 transactions each. Mattos Filho was No. 1 based on that basis for the previous three years. “For a lawyer, the number of transactions done is more important than the value because we don’t earn a fee from the value of deals, but a fixed value by hour of work,” said Carlos Lima, the Pinheiro Neto partner who handled the $4.9 billion acquisition of Amil Participacoes SA (AMIL3) by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) , the No. 1 U.S. health insurer, announced on Oct. 8. For more, click here. Moves Litigation Partner Kiser Joins Loeb & Loeb in Chicago Loeb & Loeb LLP announced that litigator Livia M.

Litigation Visa, MasterCard $7.25 Billion Fee Deal Wins Early Approval Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) ’s proposed $7.25 billion settlement of a merchant fee price-fixing case received preliminary approval by a federal judge in Brooklyn , New York. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson made his ruling Nov. 9 after considering arguments by retailers opposed to the deal. The judge’s decision allows plaintiffs to begin signing up the more than 7 million retailers that might be eligible to participate. Estimated to be the largest-ever private antitrust settlement, the deal would end a seven-year-long case alleging that the card companies conspired with major banks to fix interchange, or swipe, fees charged to merchants when customers pay with plastic. In an Oct. 24 order, the judge said the deal would likely meet requirements for the initial sign-off, a threshold he said is “meaningfully lower” than that of a later final approval. Still, lawyers for the opponents were hopeful they could change his mind, given that there are provisions in the deal allowing some elements they claim are unfair to go into effect at the preliminary stage. In court papers, retailers and trade associations opposing the settlement amount -- including $6.05 billion in cash payments and a temporary interchange fee abatement -- say it falls far short of the damages plaintiffs might have recovered at trial. Plaintiffs could have won as much as $300 billion if the case had been fully litigated and the court awarded triple damages as permitted under antitrust law, a lawyer for one group of objectors said in an Oct. 18 filing, referring to an August analysis by Georgetown University law professor Adam Levitin. “The proposed settlement is far south of this number, not even 10 percent of the potential recoverable damages should this case be tried,” said the lawyer, Jerrold Parker, who is representing about three dozen small businesses, including restaurants and auto dealerships. During the hearing Nov. 9 in a standing-room-only courtroom, Patrick Coughlin, a lawyer for plaintiffs in favor of the settlement, said that some large merchants oppose the deal because they are planning to start a competing payment network, the Merchant Customer Exchange. The exchange, or MCX, was formed by merchants including Target Corp. (TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , which also oppose the settlement. Stephen Neuwirth, an attorney for Home Depot Inc. (HD) , said that the company is concerned about the legal releases and potential lack of ability to decline participation. “It’s so obvious Visa and MasterCard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given,” he said. “It’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the Home Depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this is a bad deal.” The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).

Firm News Mattos Filho Takes Top M&A Legal-Adviser Rank: Corporate Brazil  The top-ranked law firm for mergers and acquisitions in Brazil this year is Mattos Filho, Veiga Filho, Marrey Jr. & Quiroga Advogados after it helped complete more buyout-fund transactions than any other legal adviser. Mattos Filho handled deals totaling $14.3 billion this year through Nov. 8, giving it 27 percent of the market and propelling it past 2011’s leader, Barbosa Mussnich & Aragao, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Sao Paulo-based firm advised on eight of the 64 transactions involving buyout funds so far this year. “Increasing competition for deals between private-equity funds has kept us working a lot,” Joao Ricardo de Azevedo Ribeiro, a senior partner at Mattos Filho, said in an interview. He credited the firm’s New York office for winning assignments on international buyouts. Estok Comercio & Representacoes Ltda., owner of the Tok&Stok chain of furniture stores, hired Mattos Filho to advise on its sale of a 60 percent stake to Carlyle Group LP (CG) for 700 million reais ($343 million). The law firm also advised London- based private-equity company Actis LLP on its pending 180 million-real purchase of Cruzeiro do Sul Educacional, a Sao Paulo-based for-profit university. Private-equity funds participated in 64 M&A transactions in Brazil, or 12 percent of the 552 deals so far this year. That’s up from 57 deals, or 9.6 percent, of the 596 transactions announced in the same period of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mattos Filho and Pinheiro Neto tied for first place based on the number of deals, with 37 transactions each. Mattos Filho was No. 1 based on that basis for the previous three years. “For a lawyer, the number of transactions done is more important than the value because we don’t earn a fee from the value of deals, but a fixed value by hour of work,” said Carlos Lima, the Pinheiro Neto partner who handled the $4.9 billion acquisition of Amil Participacoes SA (AMIL3) by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) , the No. 1 U.S. health insurer, announced on Oct. 8. For more, click here. Moves Litigation Partner Kiser Joins Loeb & Loeb in Chicago Loeb & Loeb LLP announced that litigator Livia M.

Blue-Collar Vacation-Home Dreams in Michigan Fade With Auto Jobs,['Chris Christoff'],2012-11-12 05:00:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/blue-collar-vacation-home-dreams-in-michigan-fade-with-auto-jobs.html,"Michigan ’s blue-collar dream of owning a vacation home is going the way of the gas guzzler. Thanks to a scaled-back auto industry and dwindling family incomes, northern summer houses for families in urban areas like Detroit and Flint are now the province of executives, professionals and business owners with more disposable income, said real-estate agents in one of the state’s recreation havens. It’s a reflection of a changing economy. Sales have plunged along the Lake Huron shore, and on inland lakes and forests, with some prices dropping as much as 40 percent since 2008. Many homes had been built decades ago with auto-industry wages that exceeded the national average for manufacturing , and were handed down through families. Those wages supported a lifestyle of multiple cars, recreational vehicles, college educations and second homes, especially for families with two paychecks that, in the 1990s, could each be $100,000 with overtime. Related links: “Maybe they were upper middle class and didn’t know it,” said Craig McMurray, a real-estate agent and city councilman in East Tawas on Lake Huron’s southern Michigan shore. “They worked hard, played hard and they are a huge part of growth here in northeast Michigan.” Michigan doesn’t keep data showing how many people own second homes, said Terry Stanton , a treasury department spokesman. Locals say auto-company retirees have become more prevalent as year-round residents on the eastern shoreline, with pensions and benefits better than those of new hires. ‘Difficult’ Dream “That dream of the up-north cottage is much more difficult today,” McMurray said. The 2009 bankruptcies and resurgence of General Motors Corp. (GM) and Chrysler Group LLC are emblems of a leaner economy, though the second-home market was spinning out of reach for blue-collar workers years earlier, said Kelly Dehner, a real- estate broker near East Tawas. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, auto workers flocked to buy second homes in case another attack threatened their city residences, Dehner said. A few years later, she watched workers weep as they sold because their paychecks decreased or disappeared. “A vacation home is where you have fun, where families get together to forget their troubles,” Dehner said. “There are a lot of good memories there.” Employee Declines The change reflects the waning economic clout of the Michigan-based auto industry. The share of U.S. vehicle sales by the three domestic automakers fell to 44 percent in September, from 64 percent in December 2002, according to Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-based Autodata Corp., a research firm. The number of people who worked in vehicle and parts manufacturing in Michigan dropped to 116,300 in 2009 from 295,500 in 2001, according to the Ann Arbor-based Center for Automotive Research. In all, Michigan lost 860,000 jobs from 2000 to 2009. Its unemployment rate led the nation during the 18-month recession that began in December 2007, peaking at 14.2 percent in August 2009. That recession hit northeast Michigan’s housing market, where prices are starting to recover, according to real estate agents. Entry Level Since 2007, the United Auto Workers has agreed to let automakers hire workers who forgo traditional retiree health care, equal pay for equal work, job security and pensions in exchange for jobs that would have gone to Mexico or Asia. About 13 percent of GM, Ford Motor Co. (F) and Chrysler Group LLC hourly workers, or 15,155 employees, now are entry level, and lack traditional union retiree benefits, according to the auto companies. Most of those workers make less than the $19.10 hourly average U.S. manufacturing wage. At one Detroit-area General Motors assembly plant as many as half the workers are entry level at the lower wages, according to the United Auto Workers local there. Scott Zimmerman, 41, works at a Lansing General Motors plant that assembles Cadillacs. Owning a vacation home isn’t within reach, even at his UAW top-tier wage of $28 an hour, he said. He said his grandfather still owns a lake cottage he bought more than 40 years ago when he worked at a Lansing plant. “The banks aren’t loaning money like they used to,” Zimmerman said outside the plant where he works. His two daughters will attend college, Zimmerman said. “That’s tapping me out pretty good right there.” Shrinking Salary Terry Towns, 58, said his pay at the Lansing plant is half the $80,000 a year he earned as a truck driver for GM parts in Flint. Towns transferred to the Lansing plant when the company’s 2009 bankruptcy cut his pay, and he lost the home he bought for $154,000 months earlier. He said he can’t think about a second home. “I went from $28 an hour on a Friday to $15 an hour the next Monday,” Towns said. Those in the market will find good deals. Five to seven years ago a cottage with 50-foot frontage on Lake Huron sold for $249,000 to $269,000. Now, the same place will fetch $179,000 to $199,000, said East Tawas real-estate broker Kimberly Lingo. Sales of property purchased for hunting have fallen, too, Lingo said. Still, some homes on prime lakefront cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, including a $1.3 million, 4,000 square foot property on Tawas Bay with bamboo floors, two fireplaces, attached garage, granite countertops and three bathrooms. ‘Coming Home’ Reduced prices and low interest rates spurred David Peplinski, 48, to buy a house on Lake Huron near Oscoda. Peplinski, an information-technology specialist from a Detroit suburb, said his family for 15 years rented vacation homes and longed for their own as a retreat and investment. Peplinski said he paid $162,000 for a two-bedroom home with a garage and 50 feet of a sand beach. “We feel like we’re coming home,” Peplinski said. Cheryl and Ed Sowa bought a retirement home in East Tawas three years ago. Both worked at General Motors. Cheryl Sowa, 62, said as a young mother of three working at a Flint auto plant, she bought a cabin on an inland lake west of Oscoda that she sold when she retired. Sowa said she’s aware that newly hired autoworkers are paid about half what senior UAW members make. “That $10 an hour more could afford them a second home,” she said.

Petraeus’s Russian Double,['Leonid Bershidsky'],2012-11-12 22:15:32,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/petraeus-s-russian-double.html,"Talk about parallels. To Russians, the adultery-related resignation of Central Intelligence Director David Petraeus looks uncannily like a scandal that recently hit their own defense minister, Igor Serdyukov. Petraeus resigned on Nov. 9, citing his “poor judgment” in conducting an extramarital affair, apparently with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. Russian President Vladimir Putin fired Serdyukov on Nov. 6 amid rumors that the minister was having an affair with his subordinate, Yevgenia Vasilyeva. The simultaneous scandals show just how differently the political machines in Moscow and Washington work. Petraeus's indiscretion was discovered by accident during an investigation into an e-mail harassment case, according to U.S. news reports. By then, the affair had ended, and only the incriminating messages remained. The White House was informed, and the four-star general tendered his resignation amid discussions of possible security breaches that could be caused by such behavior. Petraeus himself acknowledged the danger. Nothing was so straightforward in Serdyukov's case. On Oct. 25, according to Russian news reports , investigators were greeted by the minister himself when they arrived to search a 13-room apartment that belonged to Vasilyeva, then head of the Defense Ministry 's property department. She was a suspect in a major corruption case. Investigators said Vasilyeva's department invested vast amounts of government money in the renovation of Defense Ministry properties that were later sold off cheaply to private companies. The search turned up $3 million worth of jewelry, according to the state-controlled news service Vesti. The inventory took several days to complete. Bloggers and some media immediately trumpeted that Serdyukov was romantically involved with Vasilyeva. After all, the investigators had found him in her apartment at about 6 a.m. Some of the information came from sources within the ministry, where Serdyukov, the first civilian to head Russia's vast military machine, was widely hated for his cost-cutting initiatives and his drive for a smaller, more professional armed force. Serdyukov has neither confirmed nor denied the affair. Adultery would be politically perilous in Serdyukov's case. His wife is Yulia Zubkova, the daughter of longtime Putin ally and former Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov , who currently serves as chairman of the natural gas monopoly Gazprom. The Serdyukovs and Vasilyeva are neighbors. “Serdyukov should not have angered his father-in-law,” journalist Tatyana Netreba wrote on the website of the newspaper Argumenti i Fakti. “We are all human, but this is not just an office romance, it's an affair being conducted in plain sight of the lawful wife, the beloved daughter of a top official.” Some commentators suspected that the sex scandal might be little more than a convenient explanation for Serdyukov's dismissal. Alexei Venediktov, head of the influential Echo Moscow radio station, pointed out that Serdyukov was not the only top defense official to go. Nikolai Makarov , chief of the general staff, also lost his job, even though “he had not jilted a former prime minister's daughter."" “Under Serdyukov and Makarov, the Defense Ministry refused the obsolete armaments offered by the military-industrial complex for untold sums of government money. Instead, it demanded modern weaponry, including soldier-protection systems,” Venediktov wrote. Defense-industry lobbyists ""demanded that the military buy what was already developed and produced."" Liberal commentator Yulia Latynina noted that infidelity is rarely seen as an unacceptable offense among senior Russian officials. “If Serdyukov was fired for being unfaithful,” she wrote , “then why is he denied what others are allowed? It's been a long time since we saw Lyudmila Putina by her august husband's side, for example."" Serdyukov's ouster comes at a time when Russia is stepping up the rearmament of its military. In 2013, defense spending is projected to increase almost 15 percent to about $71 billion, or 3.2 percent of gross domestic product. The exact breakdown of the expenditure is classified, but much of it is going toward the development and purchase of new weapons systems.

To Russians, the adultery-related resignation of Central Intelligence Director David Petraeus looks uncannily like a scandal that recently hit their own defense minister, Igor Serdyukov. Petraeus resigned on Nov. 9, citing his “poor judgment” in conducting an extramarital affair, apparently with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. Russian President Vladimir Putin fired Serdyukov on Nov. 6 amid rumors that the minister was having an affair with his subordinate, Yevgenia Vasilyeva. The simultaneous scandals show just how differently the political machines in Moscow and Washington work. Petraeus's indiscretion was discovered by accident during an investigation into an e-mail harassment case, according to U.S. news reports. By then, the affair had ended, and only the incriminating messages remained. The White House was informed, and the four-star general tendered his resignation amid discussions of possible security breaches that could be caused by such behavior. Petraeus himself acknowledged the danger. Nothing was so straightforward in Serdyukov's case. On Oct. 25, according to Russian news reports , investigators were greeted by the minister himself when they arrived to search a 13-room apartment that belonged to Vasilyeva, then head of the Defense Ministry 's property department. She was a suspect in a major corruption case. Investigators said Vasilyeva's department invested vast amounts of government money in the renovation of Defense Ministry properties that were later sold off cheaply to private companies. The search turned up $3 million worth of jewelry, according to the state-controlled news service Vesti. The inventory took several days to complete. Bloggers and some media immediately trumpeted that Serdyukov was romantically involved with Vasilyeva. After all, the investigators had found him in her apartment at about 6 a.m. Some of the information came from sources within the ministry, where Serdyukov, the first civilian to head Russia's vast military machine, was widely hated for his cost-cutting initiatives and his drive for a smaller, more professional armed force. Serdyukov has neither confirmed nor denied the affair. Adultery would be politically perilous in Serdyukov's case. His wife is Yulia Zubkova, the daughter of longtime Putin ally and former Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov , who currently serves as chairman of the natural gas monopoly Gazprom. The Serdyukovs and Vasilyeva are neighbors. “Serdyukov should not have angered his father-in-law,” journalist Tatyana Netreba wrote on the website of the newspaper Argumenti i Fakti. “We are all human, but this is not just an office romance, it's an affair being conducted in plain sight of the lawful wife, the beloved daughter of a top official.” Some commentators suspected that the sex scandal might be little more than a convenient explanation for Serdyukov's dismissal. Alexei Venediktov, head of the influential Echo Moscow radio station, pointed out that Serdyukov was not the only top defense official to go. Nikolai Makarov , chief of the general staff, also lost his job, even though “he had not jilted a former prime minister's daughter."" “Under Serdyukov and Makarov, the Defense Ministry refused the obsolete armaments offered by the military-industrial complex for untold sums of government money. Instead, it demanded modern weaponry, including soldier-protection systems,” Venediktov wrote. Defense-industry lobbyists ""demanded that the military buy what was already developed and produced."" Liberal commentator Yulia Latynina noted that infidelity is rarely seen as an unacceptable offense among senior Russian officials. “If Serdyukov was fired for being unfaithful,” she wrote , “then why is he denied what others are allowed? It's been a long time since we saw Lyudmila Putina by her august husband's side, for example."" Serdyukov's ouster comes at a time when Russia is stepping up the rearmament of its military. In 2013, defense spending is projected to increase almost 15 percent to about $71 billion, or 3.2 percent of gross domestic product. The exact breakdown of the expenditure is classified, but much of it is going toward the development and purchase of new weapons systems. Dmitry Rogozin, deputy prime minister in charge of the defense industry, gloated in an interview with the state-controlled RIA news agency, saying he hoped ""the Defense Ministry will fix the planning system for ordering armaments, and the industry will resume stable, high-quality production.""

Obama Will Start 2nd Term With Unfinished Climate Business,['Eric Pooley'],2012-11-12 18:05:47,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/a-business-friendly-climate-agenda-for-obama-s-second-term.html,"Harvard Business Review -- President Obama has some unfinished business to attend to, and taking care of it will require help and support from corporate leaders across the country. When he ran for president in 2008, Obama made three big promises: end the Iraq War, extend health care coverage to all Americans, and take federal action to reduce the threat of global climate change. He delivered on the first two. And though his Administration made some progress on emissions reduction by doubling federal fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles, the president chose not to move comprehensive climate legislation through a recalcitrant Senate in the wake of the Great Recession. After 2010, climate all but disappeared from the national conversation. Hurricane Sandy put it back on the map. Sandy is just the latest reminder that climate change, which fed the storm's fury by warming Atlantic waters and loading moisture into the atmosphere, isn't going away. Since January, we have seen record drought, rising commodities prices, the lowest Arctic ice levels in recorded history, and a rash of costly extreme weather events. In fact, 2012 is likely to be the hottest year since accurate record-keeping began in the late 19th century. And as Sandy's $50 billion estimated price tag demonstrates, the cost of doing nothing is far greater than the cost of taking action. So what can the President do to fulfill his promise, reiterated in his victory speech, to ensure that America ""isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet""? Some argue that he can't do much, since he faces a divided Congress where some members still reject the reality of climate change. But as Obama is fond of saying, presidents are not elected to do the easy things, and political realities are not set in stone. Sandy has not only restarted the climate conversation in this country; it has also changed the calculus of what is politically possible. Here are five steps the president should take to address climate change — from no-brainer ideas almost everyone can agree on to ambitious items that would require Congressional action. None is likely to be successful without the active support and participation of the business community. 1. Feed the conversation. President Obama can start by simply by talking about the issue — adding to the national climate conversation that began in Sandy's wake, and helping Americans connect the dots between emissions, climate change, and extreme weather. After two years of climate silence in America, this conversation is crucial — and if it is going to lead anywhere, it must include voices from business: Insurance companies talking about the cost of climate inaction. Main Street organizations talking about the need for community resilience in the face of severe weather events. Local first responders, who are often volunteers with day jobs in the business community, talking about the deadly weather trends they are experiencing. It is worth remembering that strong business support helped secure passage of the House climate bill in 2009, and though that effort failed in the Senate, no serious legislation can move without the backing of men and women in the engine room of the American economy. To be politically viable, climate solutions must be economically sustainable. 2. Reduce climate accelerants. President Obama can take immediate steps to reduce potent greenhouse gases other than carbon, such as methane and fluorinated gases used in refrigerants and industrial applications. Although carbon gets most of the attention, these substances are ""climate accelerants"" — they fuel global warming the same way gasoline fuels a fire. Consider methane, the primary component in natural gas. Though it burns cleaner than coal, when it leaks into the atmosphere uncombusted, its effect on the climate is 72 times more potent than that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame. And methane is leaking from the entire natural gas system — from wells, pipelines, and storage facilities. Shockingly, no one knows precisely how much methane is leaking — that's why Environmental Defense Fund and the University of Texas are partnering with nine natural gas companies to measure the leaks. The good news is that we have the technology to detect and reduce leakage — and no one should be against common sense measures to prevent the waste of this precious natural resource. Depending on how much leakage we are able to stop, this initiative could have the same climate benefit as shutting down a third of the coal-fired power plants in the United States. Smart regulations are needed to address leaks from oil and gas drilling; the Obama Administration took a first step in this direction earlier in the year, but there's much more to do.. Natural gas companies such as Southwestern Energy have found that the cost of plugging leaks is offset by selling the recovered gas; the industry benefits from leak reduction and should support these rules. We also need to phase out the use of fluorinated gases, which are, pound for pound, hundreds or even thousands of times more potent than CO2. Although today they represent only a small part of global emissions, their use is rising fast, especially in India and China. The U.S. has proposed bringing them under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer , and we should begin ending their use here at home. Fortunately, U.S. companies are technology leaders in developing acceptable substitutes. Just as business leadership was crucial when we turned back the threat to the ozone layer from chlorofluorocarbons, it will be essential today. 3. Start a clean energy race. The Obama Administration can do much more to promote energy efficiency and clean, renewable technologies. To begin, it can get serious about reducing subsidies for fossil fuels, which have slanted the playing field for too long. An industry that records hundreds of billions in profits every year needs no further help from the federal government. Obama should also continue tax credits for green, renewable energy while increasing R&D funding. Wind and solar are almost cost competitive with coal, and they're cheaper if externalities are taken into account. An extra boost in R&D funding could make all the difference. Congress should pass national clean energy standards, which would require states to get more energy from renewables. Some 30 U.S. states have them, China has them — why shouldn't the U.S.? The administration should also encourage private capital to invest in low-carbon energy. This means getting state public utility commissions and regional power market operators to remove barriers to investments in efficiency and renewables. The emerging, interactive ""smart grid"" can also be a green grid, encouraging distributed power generation and demand response that reduces the need for baseload generation. It's not sexy, but it is hugely important. Obama should own it in his second term, and every business owner who would prefer to sell solar power to her local utility, instead of buying power from it, should get on board. 4. Use the Clean Air Act. As it began to do in its first term, the Obama administration should use the Clean Air Act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, under authority confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. EPA. This means vigorously defending the clean-air rules the Obama Administrations already put in place, including the historic higher fuel economy standards for new cars and trucks and restrictions on the emission of mercury and other toxic air pollution for power plants. Keeping these rules in place will stop millions of tons of carbon pollution from entering the atmosphere in the future. The Obama Administration should also set CO2 emission standards for new and existing power plants through flexible and economically efficient approaches, including emissions trading and averaging, so power companies can meet standards across their fleet of plants and not at individual facilities. The EPA should design these standards in a way that rewards states that devise their own emissions reduction programs, as California and the Northeastern states have done. And it is time for business leaders who understand that climate change imposes real costs to accept that climate action has some manageable costs as well, and that we no longer have the luxury of ducking them. 5. Put a price on carbon. Economists from across the political spectrum, including N. Gregory Mankiw , Douglas Holtz-Eakin , and Arthur Laffer on the right, agree that the most economically efficient way to cut carbon pollution is by imposing a price via a cap or tax. Either would be a powerful incentive to produce cleaner power and could be accompanied by lower taxes on labor or capital, easing the impact on working families and business. As we move toward the fiscal cliff, there is plenty of discussion in Washington, from stakeholders on both sides of the aisle, about raising revenue through a carbon fee as part of a grand bargain on the budget. A carbon tax starting at $20 per metric and rising at 6% a year could raise $154 billion by 2021, according to HSBC analyst Nick Robins. ""Applied to the Congressional Budget Office's 2012 baseline, this would halve the fiscal deficit by 2022,"" he wrote in a note to clients. Such a proposal would surely encounter fierce opposition, and one White House official has already signaled that Obama isn't proposing one now. But we will never solve the problem unless our leaders begin to talk openly about it and include all costs in the discussion: the cost of climate action, the cost of climate inaction, and the cost of climate resilience. Sandy focused attention on the need to harden our shorelines and communities against storm surges; sea gates to protect New York Harbor from the next big one could cost at least $10 billion. If that turns out to be the best course of action, who is going to pay for it? Addressing such vulnerabilities is essential, but it amounts to treating one potentially fatal symptom of the problem. If we raise the necessary funds via a carbon price, then we are addressing the cause as well as a symptom. And no amount of infrastructure hardening will protect our cities unless we also reduce emissions. That's the kind of grown-up conversation we need to have, and there's no one better suited to lead it than the president.

Consumers Closing Wallets in Japan Add to Noda’s Woes: Economy,['Andy Sharp'],2012-11-13 06:57:40,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/consumers-flee-to-cash-in-japan-as-noda-s-economic-woes-deepen.html,"Japanese consumers are closing their wallets as the economy’s outlook darkens, making it harder for Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda to stave off the nation’s third recession in four years. Households are holding the most cash since 2005, shunning risk as they grow gloomier, Bank of Japan data shows. Sliding private consumption contributed to an annualized 3.5 percent decline in gross domestic product in the past quarter, a Cabinet Office report showed yesterday. While Noda may have avoided a fiscal cliff as the opposition agreed to a deal on deficit-financing legislation, the consumer malaise highlights the challenge of reviving growth in the world’s third-largest economy. At the same time as he tries to rebuild relations with China to support exports, Noda may need to come up with more incentives for consumer purchases at home. “The Japanese government has no choice but to implement additional measures to shore up the economy,” said Junko Nishioka , chief economist at RBS Securities Japan Ltd and a former BOJ official. “The dispute with China, the decline of the stock market, and confusion over the political situation in Japan are hurting confidence.” The Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) closed down 0.2 percent in Tokyo, its seventh day of decline and 15.5 percent below this year’s high in March. Weak Sentiment Sentiment on the economic outlook was the weakest last month since the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake, a government survey showed, with the end of car subsidies and a looming sales-tax increase also making people more pessimistic. Japan risks its third textbook-definition recession since 2008, meaning two straight quarters of contraction. The median forecast in a survey of economists by Bloomberg News is for an annualized 0.4 percent contraction in the September to December period. Japanese recessions are officially defined by a government-charged panel that considers data beyond GDP figures. “We need a firm response considering the grim outlook for the Japanese economy,” Economy Minister Seiji Maehara told reporters today. He declined to comment on the size of any new fiscal stimulus measures. Consumption in the third quarter dropped at an annual rate of 1.8 percent after a 0.4 percent fall in the previous three months, the first back-to-back decline since the global financial crisis, yesterday’s report from the Cabinet Office showed. Conditions Worsening The main index in the government’s Economy Watchers Survey, which looks at how people feel about the outlook for the next two to three months, fell to 41.7 in October, the lowest level since the aftermath of last year’s earthquake. A figure under 50 indicates that more people see conditions deteriorating than improving. Respondents to the survey included a travel agent in the Tokai region of central Japan, who complained that territorial disputes with China and South Korea were deterring people from traveling abroad. A car salesman in Shikoku, southern Japan, said the end of government subsidies for fuel-efficient cars was hurting business, while a supermarket manager in the same region noted concerns among shoppers over a planned doubling of the sales tax. In other economic releases today, Japan’s September industrial production fell the most since last year’s earthquake, a final reading showed. In a separate report released today, Philippine exports gained in September at the fastest pace in 21 months as demand from Asian economies including Japan and Hong Kong rose. Global Economy Spain, Italy and the U.K. will announce price data for October. France will probably announce that non-farm payrolls fell 0.2 percent in the third quarter, the second straight decline, according to a Bloomberg news survey. Brazil retail sales probably rose 0.2 percent on month in September, matching the previous month’s gain, according to a survey of 39 economists. The Japanese government announced on Oct. 26 a 750 billion- yen ($9 billion) stimulus package to shore up growth, the scope of which was limited by the political standoff that was blocking legislation to allow borrowing to pay for this year’s deficit. The measures compare with more than 20 trillion yen in spending to boost the economy and pay for rebuilding budgeted after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Political Paralysis “The government has few tools to boost the economy as its term will end soon, the budget deficit is so huge and political paralysis means it’s hard to agree on measures,” said Hiroaki Muto , a senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party reached a deal with the ruling Democratic Party of Japan to end a stalemate over legislation to fund the rest of this year’s budget, LDP policy chief Akira Amari told reporters in Tokyo today. Worsening sentiment may be filtering through to the investment market, with BOJ data for this year showing that holdings of securities such as stocks, bonds and investment trusts as a proportion of household assets are at the lowest since 2005. “People have no incentive to take risks,” said Masamichi Adachi , a senior economist at JPMorgan Securities Japan Co. in Tokyo and a former central bank official. “They are just putting money into banks, and it’s very unlikely they will move to securities in the future.” Job Losses Companies are cutting jobs and trimming pay as profits fall. Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , the world’s largest micro- controller maker, plans to cut thousands of jobs, while TDK Corp. (6762) , a manufacturer of electric components, will shed 1,000 domestic positions. Sharp Corp. (6753) , Panasonic Corp. (6752) and Sony Corp. (6758) posted record losses last year, and are cutting jobs and production lines in a bid to return to profitability. Large businesses cut winter bonuses by 2.7 percent from last year to 781,396 yen, according to a report last week by the Keidanren, a business lobby. Machinery orders , an indicator of capital spending , fell the most in four months in September, and exports dropped 10.3 percent in the same month. Net exports, or shipments less imports, subtracted 0.7 percentage point from GDP on a quarterly basis, the biggest decline in three quarters. Noda this year pushed legislation through parliament to double the sales tax to help fund welfare spending in the world’s oldest society, and has said he will not call a general election unless a framework for revamping the social security system is established.

Households are holding the most cash since 2005, shunning risk as they grow gloomier, Bank of Japan data shows. Sliding private consumption contributed to an annualized 3.5 percent decline in gross domestic product in the past quarter, a Cabinet Office report showed yesterday. While Noda may have avoided a fiscal cliff as the opposition agreed to a deal on deficit-financing legislation, the consumer malaise highlights the challenge of reviving growth in the world’s third-largest economy. At the same time as he tries to rebuild relations with China to support exports, Noda may need to come up with more incentives for consumer purchases at home. “The Japanese government has no choice but to implement additional measures to shore up the economy,” said Junko Nishioka , chief economist at RBS Securities Japan Ltd and a former BOJ official. “The dispute with China, the decline of the stock market, and confusion over the political situation in Japan are hurting confidence.” The Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) closed down 0.2 percent in Tokyo, its seventh day of decline and 15.5 percent below this year’s high in March. Weak Sentiment Sentiment on the economic outlook was the weakest last month since the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake, a government survey showed, with the end of car subsidies and a looming sales-tax increase also making people more pessimistic. Japan risks its third textbook-definition recession since 2008, meaning two straight quarters of contraction. The median forecast in a survey of economists by Bloomberg News is for an annualized 0.4 percent contraction in the September to December period. Japanese recessions are officially defined by a government-charged panel that considers data beyond GDP figures. “We need a firm response considering the grim outlook for the Japanese economy,” Economy Minister Seiji Maehara told reporters today. He declined to comment on the size of any new fiscal stimulus measures. Consumption in the third quarter dropped at an annual rate of 1.8 percent after a 0.4 percent fall in the previous three months, the first back-to-back decline since the global financial crisis, yesterday’s report from the Cabinet Office showed. Conditions Worsening The main index in the government’s Economy Watchers Survey, which looks at how people feel about the outlook for the next two to three months, fell to 41.7 in October, the lowest level since the aftermath of last year’s earthquake. A figure under 50 indicates that more people see conditions deteriorating than improving. Respondents to the survey included a travel agent in the Tokai region of central Japan, who complained that territorial disputes with China and South Korea were deterring people from traveling abroad. A car salesman in Shikoku, southern Japan, said the end of government subsidies for fuel-efficient cars was hurting business, while a supermarket manager in the same region noted concerns among shoppers over a planned doubling of the sales tax. In other economic releases today, Japan’s September industrial production fell the most since last year’s earthquake, a final reading showed. In a separate report released today, Philippine exports gained in September at the fastest pace in 21 months as demand from Asian economies including Japan and Hong Kong rose. Global Economy Spain, Italy and the U.K. will announce price data for October. France will probably announce that non-farm payrolls fell 0.2 percent in the third quarter, the second straight decline, according to a Bloomberg news survey. Brazil retail sales probably rose 0.2 percent on month in September, matching the previous month’s gain, according to a survey of 39 economists.

U.S. Oil Output to Overtake Saudi Arabia’s by 2020,['Lananh Nguyen'],2012-11-12 17:39:50,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/u-s-to-overtake-saudi-arabia-s-oil-production-by-2020-iea-says.html,"U.S. oil output is poised to surpass Saudi Arabia’s in the next decade, making the world’s biggest fuel consumer almost self-reliant and putting it on track to become a net exporter, the International Energy Agency said. Growing supplies of crude extracted through new technology including hydraulic fracturing of underground rock formations will transform the U.S. into the largest producer for about five years starting about 2020, the Paris-based adviser to 28 nations said today in its annual World Energy Outlook. The U.S. met 83 percent of its energy needs in the first six months of this year, according to the Energy Department in Washington. “The IEA outlook feeds into the idea of a shift in the center of influence in the world oil market,” said Gareth Lewis-Davies, an analyst at BNP Paribas SA in London. “Given Saudi Arabia is willing to shift production up and down it will retain a large degree of influence, and remain important as a price-influencer.” Top Sustainability News: The U.S., whose crude imports have fallen 11 percent this year, is on track to produce the most oil since 1991, according to Energy Department data. In a year when Iran has threatened to halt Persian Gulf oil shipments, the growing output, coupled with a gas-production boom, may help insulate the nation from supply disruptions. President Barack Obama cited “freeing ourselves from foreign oil” as a policy goal in his election victory speech last week, echoing his predecessor, George W. Bush, who in 2006 urged the U.S. to break its “addiction” to imported crude. Oil Prices West Texas Intermediate crude, the benchmark U.S. grade, has dropped 13 percent this year to $85.55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, as stockpiles swelled to a 22-year high. Prices have more than quadrupled in the past decade, reaching as high as $147.27 a barrel in July 2008. Global demand for oil is projected to rise to 99.7 million barrels a day in 2035, up from 87.4 million last year, according to the IEA, which advises industrialized nations including the U.S., Germany and Japan. Today’s report projects trends to 2035. Saudi Arabia pumped 9.8 million barrels of oil a day last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. output was 6.7 million barrels a day in the week ended Nov. 2, according to the Energy Department. Overtaking Saudi Arabia The U.S. will pump 11.1 million barrels of oil a day in 2020 and 10.9 million in 2025, the IEA said. Those figures are 500,000 barrels a day and 100,000 barrels a day higher, respectively, than its forecasts for Saudi Arabia for those years. The desert kingdom is due to become the biggest producer again by 2030, pumping 11.4 million barrels a day versus 10.2 million in the U.S. “Around 2017, the U.S. will be the largest oil producer of the world, overtaking Saudi Arabia,” IEA Chief Economist Fatih Birol said at a press conference in London today. “This is of course a major development and definitely will have significant implications.” Officials at the U.S. Energy Department weren’t available for comment because government offices were closed in observance of the U.S. Veteran’s Day holiday today. A Saudi Arabian oil ministry official based in Riyadh wasn’t immediately available to comment on the report when contacted by phone today. The IEA report described the U.S.’s advancement toward energy self-sufficiency as “a dramatic reversal of the trend seen in most other energy-importing countries.” The nation is developing so-called tight oil reserves including the Bakken shale formation, which are extracted by hydraulic fracturing or horizontal drilling. Shrinking Imports U.S. oil imports will drop to about 4 million barrels a day in 10 years from a current average of 10 million because of new production and stricter fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks, which will curb demand, Birol said. The IEA isn’t alone in forecasting that the U.S. will overtake Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the largest oil producer. The U.S. will achieve that goal before the end of this decade, Citigroup Inc. said in a March 20 report that included biofuels and natural gas liquids in its calculations. The European Union banned oil imports from Iran in July over the nation’s nuclear program, reducing shipments from a country that was until then the second-biggest producer in OPEC. The IEA’s members will probably pay about $125 a barrel for imported oil by 2035, compared with Brent crude prices near $109 today on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. The North Sea grade peaked at a record $147.50 a barrel in July 2008 before tumbling to about $46 that December, and has gained in each of the three years since then. ‘Epic Failure’ Efforts by global policy makers to promote energy efficiency have been an “epic failure” and fallen short of their economic potential, Birol said. Increased energy-saving measures could cut worldwide oil demand by almost 13 million barrels a day by 2035, or the current combined output of Russia and Norway. Put another way, were efficiency measures suggested by the IEA enacted in full, the increase in world energy demand over the period would be cut in half. Natural gas consumption will rise in the forecast period, driven by China , India and the Middle East. “In the United States, low prices and abundant supply see gas overtake oil around 2030 to become the largest fuel in the energy mix,” according to the report, written by a team of researchers led by Birol. Iraqi Surge Iraq will be the biggest contributor to new oil supplies, raising production to 6 million barrels a day by 2020. By 2035, the nation’s output rate will rise to more than 8 million, overtaking Russia to become the world’s second-largest exporter, the IEA said. The country pumped 3.4 million barrels a day last month, making it the second-largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, after Saudi Arabia, according to Bloomberg estimates. The forecasts for Iraq, a special focus of this year’s IEA outlook, were previously published on Oct. 9. In emerging nations, government subsidies will continue to spur fossil fuels use, even as lower-carbon energy sources become more popular. State subsidies cost $523 billion last year, up almost 30 percent from 2010. Subsidy programs, which remain most prevalent in the Middle East and North Africa, have become more expensive as oil prices rose, the agency said.

Baby Boomers Blunt Fed Easing While Saving for Retirement,['Elizabeth Dexheimer' 'Jeff Kearns'],2012-11-12 22:52:47,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/baby-boomers-blunt-fed-easing-while-saving-for-retirement.html,"John Rodwick cuts corners so he has money to spend on his seven grandchildren and cruise around the Rocky Mountains with his wife, Jean, in their blue-trimmed Roadtrek motor home. “My wife and I love to travel, so that is our one big expense, but we are very, very conservative,” cooking and sleeping in their 19-foot vehicle, said the 72-year-old former business professor. With the value of their three-bedroom home plunging 30 percent in the past six years, the Rodwicks have become “very cost conscious,” he said. Federal Reserve officials say they’re concerned that retirees like the Rodwicks are blunting the impact of record easing aimed at creating jobs. The reason: Older people are more likely to forgo purchases of houses, cars and other big-ticket items that the Fed is trying to encourage with near-zero interest rates. And their numbers are growing, making the Fed’s task ever harder. “Spending decisions of the older age cohorts are less likely to be easily stimulated by monetary policy,” William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , said in a speech on Oct. 15, helping to explain why the economic recovery has been weaker than expected. Each day, some 10,000 of the 78 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964 -- the so-called baby boomers -- turn 65. The share of the population in that age group will swell to 18 percent by 2030 from 13 percent last year, according to the Pew Research Center in Washington. Impact Magnified People usually save more as they near retirement. Now, the effect is magnified because Americans’ wealth has been depleted by the financial crisis, which decimated home values and retirement accounts invested in stocks, according to Britt Beemer, chairman of America’s Research Group Ltd., a Summerville, South Carolina-based consumer-behavior research company. From 2007 to 2010, the median U.S. household net worth fell by 38.8 percent to $77,300, the lowest level since 1992, the Fed said in June in its Survey of Consumer Finances. The saving rate in the U.S. has averaged 4.3 percent in the 39 months since the recession ended in June 2009, compared with an average of 2.3 percent in the same period before the start of the recession in December 2007. Retirees and older workers probably will reduce spending as they anticipate tax increases and cuts in Medicare and Social Security , said Dudley, who is vice chairman of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. Incomes Hit Meanwhile, retirement incomes are being hit by the very Fed policies that are intended to spur the three-year economic expansion and reduce an unemployment rate stuck near 8 percent or higher since early 2009. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke on Oct. 24 reaffirmed a plan to buy $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities a month and keep the main interest rate near zero at least through mid-2015. The Fed has pursued a zero-rate policy since December 2008 and has already purchased more than $2.3 trillion in bonds. Risks to the U.S. posed by slowing global growth and the European debt crisis are also among the reasons the Fed is keeping interest rates low. Most U.S. stocks fell, following the worst weekly drop since June, as investors awaited budget talks in Washington and results of a European meeting on Greek aid. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at 1,380.03 at the close of trading in New York. Japan’s economy shrank last quarter as exports tumbled and consumer spending slumped, Cabinet Office data showed today in Tokyo. Gross domestic product fell an annualized 3.5 percent, the most since the earthquake and tsunami in early 2011. Interest Earnings While the Fed’s policies stimulate the U.S. economy by making it cheaper to borrow -- the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.40 percent in the week ended Nov. 8, close to the lowest on record -- they also reduce interest income for savers. The interest rate on a five-year certificate of deposit fell below 1 percent for the first time on Sept. 20, according to North Palm Beach, Florida-based Bankrate.com. On Nov. 7, the national average rate for the five-year CD was at a record low of 0.94 percent. “All this money-printing hurts savers,” Republican Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, his party’s vice presidential nominee, said during remarks at an AARP event in New Orleans on Sept. 21. “It threatens the future value of our money -- and seniors are bearing most of the risk.” Bernanke says the scant return for savers is preferable to the losses they may suffer if the central bank were to begin raising interest rates too early. ‘Significant Hardship’ Bernanke, in an Oct. 1 speech in Indianapolis, said low interest rates have “involved significant hardship for some.” Still, if the Fed “were to raise rates now, before the economic recovery is fully entrenched, house prices might resume declines, the values of businesses large and small would drop and, critically, unemployment would likely start to rise again.” Many retirees are staying in their homes, moving closer to their children or getting smaller houses with less upkeep, instead of traveling or buying luxury items and second homes, Beemer said. “The practical has taken over the aspirational,” he said. “If you’re not moving from your home and not moving to a brand new home when you retire, all those furniture items you might have purchased are no longer on the shopping list.” Adult Children The postwar generation is shifting spending toward education, mortgage debt and their adult children and away from entertainment, dining, furniture and clothes, according to a report last month from the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based research group that advocates free markets. Retirees are consistently more frugal than younger age groups, said Pamela Goodfellow, consumer insights director at BIGinsight, a research company based in Worthington, Ohio. “If you’ve got to put your kid in college, you’ve got to spend,” she said. “Retirees have almost a luxury of not having quite so many spending demands put upon them.” The demographic shift will benefit companies such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) , the largest U.S. health insurer, and TEVA Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , which manufactures generic drugs, according to James Kee, who helps oversee $1.9 billion as president of South Texas Money Management Ltd., in San Antonio , Texas. Also likely to benefit: manufacturers and retailers of discount consumer products, according to Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee $207.5 billion as chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. Price Sensitive Retirees will “be more price sensitive, and so perhaps that’s going to benefit those businesses that really target some of the lower price points,” he said. Grisel Muina, 65, retired from her job as an insurance adjuster in Miami last year and is seeking part-time work to help make ends meet. She said she has cut spending on food, cable television and home maintenance and may move into an apartment that she owns and let her daughter and grandchildren use her house. “I used to spend a lot of money, let me tell you -- I was a compulsive buyer,” Muina said. “Now I have to watch every penny that I spend, and it’s hard for me. Once you’re used to a certain way of living, it’s hard to reduce.” To ensure sufficient income later in life, Americans will need to increase savings, delay retirement and prepare for changes to entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare, according to a report by the National Academy of Sciences. Challenges Seen The U.S. faces “challenges to our future economic strength” because of the aging population’s demands on the federal budget , Roger Ferguson , a former Fed vice chairman and co-chair of the committee that produced the Academy of Sciences report, said in an Oct. 16 speech in New York. “There are fewer and fewer people working, and they are supporting more and more people who are not working,” said Ferguson, chief executive officer of New York-based TIAA-CREF, which oversees $481 billion in assets for 3.7 million retirement clients. “This is a recipe for big fiscal challenges.” Six out of every 10 baby boomers between the ages 50 and 61 say they may have to postpone retirement, according to the Pew survey. They were most likely among age groups to have said their household finances worsened and they lost money on investments since the start of the 2007-2009 recession, Pew said. Rodwick said he and his wife have pared their expenses wherever they can. They spent just $100 per day, gas included, on a summer road trip across the Great Plains and through New England to Nova Scotia. John, a former professor at Pikes Peak Community College in El Paso, Colorado, and Jean, a retired school principal, plan to remain in their home after its value plunged. “We’ve simply decided to stay where we are,” he said. “We probably will be dead and buried before the price gets back to the cost of the home that we actually built.” To contact the reporters on this story: Elizabeth Dexheimer in New York at  edexheimer@bloomberg.net ; Jeff Kearns in Washington at  jkearns3@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chris Wellisz at  cwellisz@bloomberg.net",['Elizabeth DexheimerJeff Kearns'],"Baby Boomers Blunt Fed Easing While Saving for Retirement John Rodwick cuts corners so he has money to spend on his seven grandchildren and cruise around the Rocky Mountains with his wife, Jean, in their blue-trimmed Roadtrek motor home. “My wife and I love to travel, so that is our one big expense, but we are very, very conservative,” cooking and sleeping in their 19-foot vehicle, said the 72-year-old former business professor.

Now, the effect is magnified because Americans’ wealth has been depleted by the financial crisis, which decimated home values and retirement accounts invested in stocks, according to Britt Beemer, chairman of America’s Research Group Ltd., a Summerville, South Carolina-based consumer-behavior research company. From 2007 to 2010, the median U.S. household net worth fell by 38.8 percent to $77,300, the lowest level since 1992, the Fed said in June in its Survey of Consumer Finances. The saving rate in the U.S. has averaged 4.3 percent in the 39 months since the recession ended in June 2009, compared with an average of 2.3 percent in the same period before the start of the recession in December 2007. Retirees and older workers probably will reduce spending as they anticipate tax increases and cuts in Medicare and Social Security , said Dudley, who is vice chairman of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. Incomes Hit Meanwhile, retirement incomes are being hit by the very Fed policies that are intended to spur the three-year economic expansion and reduce an unemployment rate stuck near 8 percent or higher since early 2009. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke on Oct. 24 reaffirmed a plan to buy $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities a month and keep the main interest rate near zero at least through mid-2015. The Fed has pursued a zero-rate policy since December 2008 and has already purchased more than $2.3 trillion in bonds. Risks to the U.S. posed by slowing global growth and the European debt crisis are also among the reasons the Fed is keeping interest rates low. Most U.S. stocks fell, following the worst weekly drop since June, as investors awaited budget talks in Washington and results of a European meeting on Greek aid. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at 1,380.03 at the close of trading in New York. Japan’s economy shrank last quarter as exports tumbled and consumer spending slumped, Cabinet Office data showed today in Tokyo. Gross domestic product fell an annualized 3.5 percent, the most since the earthquake and tsunami in early 2011. Interest Earnings While the Fed’s policies stimulate the U.S. economy by making it cheaper to borrow -- the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.40 percent in the week ended Nov. 8, close to the lowest on record -- they also reduce interest income for savers. The interest rate on a five-year certificate of deposit fell below 1 percent for the first time on Sept. 20, according to North Palm Beach, Florida-based Bankrate.com. On Nov. 7, the national average rate for the five-year CD was at a record low of 0.94 percent. “All this money-printing hurts savers,” Republican Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, his party’s vice presidential nominee, said during remarks at an AARP event in New Orleans on Sept. 21. “It threatens the future value of our money -- and seniors are bearing most of the risk.” Bernanke says the scant return for savers is preferable to the losses they may suffer if the central bank were to begin raising interest rates too early. ‘Significant Hardship’ Bernanke, in an Oct. 1 speech in Indianapolis, said low interest rates have “involved significant hardship for some.” Still, if the Fed “were to raise rates now, before the economic recovery is fully entrenched, house prices might resume declines, the values of businesses large and small would drop and, critically, unemployment would likely start to rise again.” Many retirees are staying in their homes, moving closer to their children or getting smaller houses with less upkeep, instead of traveling or buying luxury items and second homes, Beemer said. “The practical has taken over the aspirational,” he said. “If you’re not moving from your home and not moving to a brand new home when you retire, all those furniture items you might have purchased are no longer on the shopping list.” Adult Children The postwar generation is shifting spending toward education, mortgage debt and their adult children and away from entertainment, dining, furniture and clothes, according to a report last month from the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based research group that advocates free markets. Retirees are consistently more frugal than younger age groups, said Pamela Goodfellow, consumer insights director at BIGinsight, a research company based in Worthington, Ohio. “If you’ve got to put your kid in college, you’ve got to spend,” she said. “Retirees have almost a luxury of not having quite so many spending demands put upon them.” The demographic shift will benefit companies such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) , the largest U.S. health insurer, and TEVA Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , which manufactures generic drugs, according to James Kee, who helps oversee $1.9 billion as president of South Texas Money Management Ltd., in San Antonio , Texas. Also likely to benefit: manufacturers and retailers of discount consumer products, according to Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee $207.5 billion as chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. Price Sensitive Retirees will “be more price sensitive, and so perhaps that’s going to benefit those businesses that really target some of the lower price points,” he said. Grisel Muina, 65, retired from her job as an insurance adjuster in Miami last year and is seeking part-time work to help make ends meet. She said she has cut spending on food, cable television and home maintenance and may move into an apartment that she owns and let her daughter and grandchildren use her house. “I used to spend a lot of money, let me tell you -- I was a compulsive buyer,” Muina said. “Now I have to watch every penny that I spend, and it’s hard for me. Once you’re used to a certain way of living, it’s hard to reduce.” To ensure sufficient income later in life, Americans will need to increase savings, delay retirement and prepare for changes to entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare, according to a report by the National Academy of Sciences. Challenges Seen The U.S. faces “challenges to our future economic strength” because of the aging population’s demands on the federal budget , Roger Ferguson , a former Fed vice chairman and co-chair of the committee that produced the Academy of Sciences report, said in an Oct. 16 speech in New York. “There are fewer and fewer people working, and they are supporting more and more people who are not working,” said Ferguson, chief executive officer of New York-based TIAA-CREF, which oversees $481 billion in assets for 3.7 million retirement clients. “This is a recipe for big fiscal challenges.” Six out of every 10 baby boomers between the ages 50 and 61 say they may have to postpone retirement, according to the Pew survey. They were most likely among age groups to have said their household finances worsened and they lost money on investments since the start of the 2007-2009 recession, Pew said. Rodwick said he and his wife have pared their expenses wherever they can. They spent just $100 per day, gas included, on a summer road trip across the Great Plains and through New England to Nova Scotia. John, a former professor at Pikes Peak Community College in El Paso, Colorado, and Jean, a retired school principal, plan to remain in their home after its value plunged. “We’ve simply decided to stay where we are,” he said. “We probably will be dead and buried before the price gets back to the cost of the home that we actually built.” To contact the reporters on this story: Elizabeth Dexheimer in New York at  edexheimer@bloomberg.net ; Jeff Kearns in Washington at  jkearns3@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chris Wellisz at  cwellisz@bloomberg.net",9353,1549,-1

Maruti Says Labour Issue at Manesar Plant Resolved; September Sales Fall,['Tushar Dhara' 'Siddharth Philip'],2011-10-01 10:43:54,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-01/maruti-suzuki-s-september-sales-drop-21-after-output-disrupted-at-plant.html,"Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the maker of almost half the cars sold in India , said it resolved a labor dispute that disrupted production at one of its factories. The Indian unit of Suzuki Motor Corp. signed an agreement with workers at the plant in Manesar near New Delhi who will resume duties on Oct. 3, the company said in a statement today. The carmaker’s sales fell 21 percent to 85,565 vehicles in September from a year earlier because of the disruption at Manesar, Maruti Suzuki said in a separate statement today. Domestic sales declined 17 percent to 78,816 vehicles, while exports dropped 48 percent to 6,749 units. All workers will sign a “good-conduct bond,” according to the statement. The bond was proposed by Maruti on Aug. 29 after five employees were dismissed and 10 suspended for “deliberately causing quality problems.” The company based in New Delhi unveiled a new version of its Swift model in August as competition from Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG intensifies. The Indian carmaker had 108,000 orders for the model, it said Sept. 27. Maruti reported sales fell for the third straight month in August after demand slowed and production was reduced. The company expects the central bank’s decision to raise interest rates to damp demand for automobiles, Ajay Seth, Maruti’s chief financial officer, said on Sept. 16. The Reserve Bank of India has raised interest rates 12 times since mid-March 2010 to rein in inflation, driving down demand for cars in a country where about 80 percent of purchases are funded by loans.

Steyn, a utility back, has scored 21 points in four games at the tournament in New Zealand including a 55-meter penalty in the 13-5 victory over Samoa that sealed the Springboks’ place in the quarterfinals. “Frans Steyn is likely to go home,” De Villiers said in comments distributed by tournament organizers. “His shoulder isn’t that good. It’s 95 percent that he’s on his way home and that is a big blow for us.” Bryan Habana and fellow winger JP Pietersen are nursing “battle scars” from the match and De Villiers said team management was “presuming they can recover quick enough to take their places this coming week.” New Zealand will be without captain Richie McCaw and fly- half Dan Carter for its final pool game against Canada after both withdrew on the eve of the match with injuries. McCaw won’t play because of what he described at a news conference as a “niggly” foot injury. Carter, who was initially chosen to take over as skipper, was later withdrawn after injuring his groin at kicking practice, the New Zealand Rugby Union said in an e-mailed statement. “Carter will be further assessed this evening and an update will be given tomorrow,” the NZRU said in a statement. “No further updates will be given at this time.” Colin Slade will now start at fly-half against Canada , with hooker Andrew Hore to captain the All Blacks for the first time. Victor Vito will take over at openside flanker from McCaw. “I was pretty keen to play against Canada because it’s important for the team and for all of us that we carry on the momentum,” McCaw said. “We have a knockout game next week and I just wanted to make sure it wasn’t niggly heading into that week.” To contact the reporter on this story: Dan Baynes in Sydney at  dbaynes@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Paul Tighe at  ptighe@bloomberg.net",['Dan Baynes'],"Springboks Suffer Steyn World Cup Blow; McCaw, Carter Pull Out of Match South Africa ’s Frans Steyn will probably miss the rest of the Rugby World Cup after injuring his shoulder in yesterday’s win against Samoa, coach Peter De Villiers said.

Credit Crisis Creates Lost Generation: David G. Blanchflower,['David G.Blanchflower'],2010-01-22 00:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-01-22/credit-crisis-creates-lost-generation-david-g-blanchflower.html,"There is now a danger that the biggest fallout from the credit crisis is the creation of a lost generation of young people who never make the transition from school to work.  The U.S. job figures for December weren’t good and much worse than most commentators had expected. Payrolls fell by 85,000 last month after a gain the previous month.  About 1.7 million Americans left the workforce from July through December, a 1.1 percent drop and the biggest six-month decrease since 1961. The participation rate last month fell to the lowest level in 24 years. An exodus of discouraged workers from the market kept the U.S. unemployment rate from climbing higher than 10 percent in December. Had the labor force not decreased by 661,000 last month, the jobless rate would have been 10.4 percent.  The slowness of the recovery on the jobs front hits the young especially hard because youth employment is more sensitive to cyclic changes than it is for older workers.  From December 2008 to December 2009, the employment of 16- 24 year olds in the U.S. fell by 1.78 million, or a third of the total drop in employment of 5.4 million. In the U.K., total employment fell over the last 12 months by 432,000 while the employment of 16-24 year olds fell by 365,000, or a remarkable 85 percent of the total.  European Rates  Unemployment rates for individuals younger than 25 are currently 21 percent in the euro area and 19 percent in the U.S. They are especially high in Spain (44 percent), Ireland (29 percent) and Sweden (27 percent) as well as in most of the countries that joined the European Union in 2004, including Latvia (36 percent), Lithuania (34 percent), Hungary (29 percent), the Czech Republic (20 percent), Poland (24 percent) and Slovakia (32 percent).  Youth unemployment tends to be high among teenagers, minorities, young women with children and the least educated. In the U.S., the unemployment rate for 16-19 year olds is 27 percent overall, up from almost 21 percent a year ago and 48 percent for African-Americans.  In the U.K., the unemployment rate for those younger than 25 is 21 percent, 42 percent for high-school dropouts, and 47 percent for blacks compared with 20 percent for whites.  Permanent Scars  There is academic literature suggesting that spells of unemployment for the young tend to create permanent scars, whereas unemployment for older people leaves only temporary blemishes. This finding goes back to early work conducted by David T. Ellwood , currently dean of the Kennedy School at Harvard University.  In recent work using a unique birth cohort -- which includes everyone born in the U.K. between March 3, 1958, and March 9, 1958 -- David Bell and I found that spells of unemployment that these respondents experienced during the 1980s recession lowered their wages, significantly increased their chances of being unemployed and reduced their happiness 25 years later, and by a lot, when they were in their late 40s. More recent unemployment spells that occurred when they were in their 30s had no lasting effect.  There is also new evidence that even youngsters who choose to go to college or university are hurt if they enter the labor market in a recession.  Persistent Effects  Lisa Kahn recently showed that the labor-market consequences of graduating from college in a bad economy have large, negative and persistent effects on wages. Lifetime earnings are substantially lower than they would have been if the graduate had entered the jobs market in good times. Furthermore, cohorts who graduate in worse national economies tend to end up in lower-level occupations.  Recent work by Paola Giuliano and Antonio Spilimbergo suggests the period of early adulthood (from 18 to 25) seems to be the age range during which people are more sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. Being exposed to a recession before the age of 17 or after age 25 they found has no impact on beliefs. They find that youngsters growing up during recessions tend to believe success in life depends more on luck than on effort, they support more government redistribution, but are less confident in public institutions. Recessions have a long- lasting effect on youngsters’ beliefs.  There was further recent evidence on the consequences of rising unemployment on young people in the U.K. The Prince’s Trust, which was established by the Prince of Wales , conducted a survey of 2,000 young people in December 2009.  Down and Depressed  Compared with other young people, those who were unemployed were found to be significantly more likely to feel ashamed, rejected, lost, anxious, insecure, down and depressed, isolated and unloved. They were also significantly less happy with their health, friendships and family life than those in work or studying, much less confident of the future and more likely to say that they had turned to drugs, that they had nothing to look forward to and that their life had no direction. And many reported having suicidal thoughts.  Young people may well turn out to be the main victims of the financial crisis. That would be bad for all of us.  ( David G.

Stephen Fry Triumphs in ‘Twelfth Night’ Stage Comeback,['Mark Beech'],2012-09-26 23:00:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/stephen-fry-triumphs-in-twelfth-night-stage-comeback.html,"Strutting around in yellow stockings as Malvolio, Stephen Fry has conquered the dejection and doubts that wrecked his last appearance on the London stage. He’s starring, with Mark Rylance as Olivia, in “Twelfth Night” at Shakespeare’s Globe -- a six-week run that instantly sold out. It’s been trumpeted as London’s theatrical event of the year. Normally, you can get to stand in the replica half-timbered theater for five pounds ($8). In this case, expect to pay 50 pounds or more on EBay for the privilege. Fry’s previous appearance on the boards in 1995 was a stage-fright disaster. He pulled out of Simon Gray’s “Cell Mates” after a few days, scuppering the play. Since then he’s stuck to writing, radio, film, television and accumulating more than 4.8 million followers on Twitter. Critics aren’t invited to the Globe. We’re supposed to wait patiently until the production transfers to the West End in November -- but I’d bought a ticket as a backup. Though we’re only a couple of shows into the run, Fry’s already come into his own. He delivers a likeable portrayal of the bookish steward driven slightly crazy by ambition and love. Soon Malvolio is prancing around self-confidently. Fry has good comic timing, talking about how, in boredom, he used to “wind up my watch, or play with my --"" (suitably long pause for laughter) “some rich jewel.” All-Male Cast Director Tim Carroll’s revival has a Shakespearean all-male cast, which makes the plot even more absurd. Johnny Flynn plays a woman (Viola) pretending to be a man (Cesario).

He’s starring, with Mark Rylance as Olivia, in “Twelfth Night” at Shakespeare’s Globe -- a six-week run that instantly sold out. It’s been trumpeted as London’s theatrical event of the year. Normally, you can get to stand in the replica half-timbered theater for five pounds ($8). In this case, expect to pay 50 pounds or more on EBay for the privilege. Fry’s previous appearance on the boards in 1995 was a stage-fright disaster. He pulled out of Simon Gray’s “Cell Mates” after a few days, scuppering the play. Since then he’s stuck to writing, radio, film, television and accumulating more than 4.8 million followers on Twitter. Critics aren’t invited to the Globe. We’re supposed to wait patiently until the production transfers to the West End in November -- but I’d bought a ticket as a backup. Though we’re only a couple of shows into the run, Fry’s already come into his own. He delivers a likeable portrayal of the bookish steward driven slightly crazy by ambition and love. Soon Malvolio is prancing around self-confidently. Fry has good comic timing, talking about how, in boredom, he used to “wind up my watch, or play with my --"" (suitably long pause for laughter) “some rich jewel.” All-Male Cast Director Tim Carroll’s revival has a Shakespearean all-male cast, which makes the plot even more absurd. Johnny Flynn plays a woman (Viola) pretending to be a man (Cesario).

Fisker Raises $100 Million to Buoy Luxury Plug-in Car Business,['Alan Ohnsman'],2012-09-26 20:03:52,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/fisker-raises-100-million-to-buoy-luxury-plug-in-car-business.html,"Fisker Automotive Inc., the maker of luxury plug-in hybrid cars, said it raised more than $100 million from private investors as the startup tries to overcome issues with its Karma sedan and readies a second model. The current equity financing round increases the total raised to more than $1.2 billion, the Anaheim, California-based carmaker said in an e-mailed statement today. Production plans and details of the Atlantic, Fisker’s second rechargeable model, will be provided by December, the company said. The additional funding “is another major vote of confidence in Fisker’s pioneering technology and business model,” Chief Executive Officer Tony Posawatz said in the statement. Fisker announced the funding a day after its $103,000 Karma, which goes about 40 miles (64 kilometers) on battery power before a gasoline engine propels it, was criticized by Consumer Reports. The magazine didn’t recommend the car, citing its interior design and reliability. The carmaker, co-founded by designer Henrik Fisker , has recalled Karmas for flawed lithium- ion batteries from A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) and cooling fans. The carmaker, which was approved for $529 million in U.S. Energy Department loans in 2009 to develop and build its vehicles, also has to work out an agreement with federal officials after being cut off from one of its loans last year. Fisker’s plan to use those funds to make its second model at a closed General Motors Corp. plant in Wilmington, Delaware, has been stalled since February. Fisker’s statement today didn’t list the investors. Venture capital (KLDO) firms such as Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Palo Alto Investors LLC have backed the company, and in July it said actor Leonardo DiCaprio , a Karma owner, had invested in the company and would help promote the vehicle. About 1,500 Karmas have been delivered to customers in the U.S. and Europe since December, the company said today.

BP’s Texas Refinery Sale Shows Volatile Industry’s Decay,['Bradley Olson'],2012-09-27 20:15:22,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/bp-s-texas-refinery-sale-shows-volatile-industry-s-decay.html,"BP Plc (BP/) may get less than half the $2.85 billion it planned for selling its Texas City refinery, the third-largest in the U.S., as values for U.S. plants haven’t kept pace with soaring profits. The average price of U.S. refineries sold since 2009 indicates the plant should sell for $1 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg Industries show, a valuation that would be among the lowest in two decades. At a time when investors are enjoying the highest stock returns since 2007, BP would reap less than half of the $4.4 billion total value it estimated it would get when it put its Texas and Carson, California, plants up for sale last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Carl Icahn , Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B) and hedge fund Appaloosa Management LP have reaped returns of as much as 97 percent so far this year by investing in refiners benefiting from cheap North American crude. Asset values have stagnated as buyers shy away from the sector’s volatile history and the prospect of competition from new refineries being built in Asia. “BP wants to sell it and they want to sell it by the end of the year, so if you’re a buyer, you’re going to think you’re in a good position,” said John Auers , senior vice president at Turner Mason & Co., a Dallas-based energy consulting firm. “BP would be thrilled with $2 billion, but if you’re a buyer, why not try half that? Whatever they bid, they’re not going to pay full price.” Viability Doubts Surging profits haven’t quieted doubts about the long-term viability of an industry facing declining demand in the U.S. and Europe and steep up-down cycles, said Harold York, a vice president for Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Houston. “We’re in a boom, but they are fearing the bust and they don’t know when it’s going to happen,” York said. “Buyers see refineries are profitable today, but long term, they don’t want to be losing money with an asset they can’t dispose of.” Buyers fear that competition from new refineries planned in China, India and the Middle East may depress domestic prices and damp a burgeoning U.S. export business. As new pipelines including TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone XL are built to ship oil from Canada and North Dakota to the U.S. Gulf Coast, U.S. crude prices are likely to rise, diminishing a key cost advantage for U.S. refiners and shrinking profits, York said. Potential Buyers Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the largest independent processor of fuel in the U.S., has closely studied buying the refinery, according to a person familiar with the San Antonio-based company’s plans. Valero owns a 245,000 barrel-a-day refinery that is adjacent to the BP facility in Texas City. Combining the two plants would create the largest refinery in the U.S. The person spoke on a condition of anonymity as the talks aren’t public. Valero and PBF Energy Inc. (PBF) , a private equity-backed independent refiner run by former Philipp Brothers trader and refining magnate Thomas O’Malley, are the two most likely buyers, said Christian O’Neill, a Bloomberg Industries energy analyst. Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) , which also has a Texas City refinery, and Phillips 66 (PSX) , which abandoned plans to sell one of its plants in Louisiana, may also be suitors given a potentially lower price, O’Neill said. The Texas City refinery might be more attractive to independent refiners if they could buy the asset for a bargain price, then cash in on improving profits. Rising Shares Bill Day , a spokesman for Valero, and Scott Dean , a spokesman for London-based BP, declined to comment. Marathon, Phillips 66 and Icahn-backed CVR Energy Inc. (CVI) surged to records this month as refiners continued to earn the highest profits since 2007, when the industry enjoyed a so- called “golden age” because of higher U.S. demand and fuel margins. Valero, which is up 49 percent this year, climbed on September 14 to its highest point in four years. The rally has attracted investors such as David Tepper ’s Appaloosa, which owned 2.3 million Valero shares as of June 30. Buffett’s Berkshire owned 27.1 million shares of Phillips, which has risen 42 percent since its April 30 spinoff from ConocoPhillips. CVR Energy is up 97 percent after Icahn bought a stake in January and agitated for the company to put itself up for sale. Amid a proxy fight, he offered investors $30 a share and now holds an 82 percent stake in the company. CVR reached an all- time high of $37.66 on September 21 in New York. Refining Renaissance The latest refining renaissance has been spurred by growing supplies of cheap U.S. oil. Crude prices have dropped as producers tap into new fields in North Dakota and Texas, allowing refiners to save money on every barrel of oil they turn into gasoline, diesel or jet fuel. The margin between U.S. oil costs and fuel prices reached an average of $28.98 from April to June, the highest-ever second-quarter price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, the value of the plants that process the fuel has reached historic lows based on an industry yardstick that compares the price at which a plant sells with how much it would cost to replace it, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Industries. Plants have sold for about 12 percent of their replacement cost since 2009, which would result in a price of $1 billion for the refinery. The historical average is between 20 percent and 30 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lower Price Analysts also use price per barrel of refining capacity to evaluate plant sales. Since 2009, 11 refineries have sold for an average of $3,128 a barrel, according to transactional data compiled by Bloomberg. On that basis, the refinery may have a price tag of $1.5 billion, leaving the company about $1.72 billion short of its $4.4 billion goal for the two refineries. The lower price may force BP to put other assets on the block, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. BP initially expected its refineries to sell for more than the 10-year average of $6,000 a barrel of refining capacity, Iain Conn , the company’s head of refining and marketing, said in February 2011. Last month, BP announced an agreement to sell its refinery and related assets in Carson, California for $1.18 billion, or about $4,417 a barrel of processing capacity. To reach the $4.4 billion target for the two plants, BP’s Texas City refinery would have to sell for $3.2 billion, more than double the average since 2009. The Carson refinery sale and BP’s $5.55 billion divestiture of its stakes in a group of Gulf of Mexico fields last week raised to $32 billion the company’s total asset sales since 2010. The company aims to raise $38 billion from divestitures by the end of 2013 after a 2010 explosion at its Macondo well in the Gulf killed 11 workers. BP Pressure “If BP does come up short, they’ll have to go farther down their list of assets to sell,” said Youngberg, who rates BP’s American Depository Receipts a hold and doesn’t own shares. “They’ve got to meet the guidance number they’ve provided for investors to get more comfortable.” The history of BP’s Texas City plant, site of one of the most deadly refining accidents in 20 years, may be another deterrent to buyers, said Turner Mason’s Auers. BP pleaded guilty to a violation of the Clean Air Act and paid a $50 million fine. The company also paid $2.1 billion in settlements with blast victims. BP agreed in July to pay more than $13 million in additional fines and continues to negotiate with the U.S. Department of Labor about more than 20 remaining citations. BP spent $1 billion to upgrade production units and improve safety at the plant, the company has said. “Refinery sales are challenging all over the world due to the economic slowdown we’re seeing in many markets,” said Gianna Bern , president of risk-management consultant Brookshire Advisory and Research, Inc. “This refinery is a tough sell for the associated liabilities that could go with it. That all manifests itself in a lackluster price tag.” To contact the reporter on this story: Bradley Olson in Houston at  bradleyolson@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Susan Warren at  susanwarren@bloomberg.net",['Bradley Olson'],"BP’s Texas Refinery Sale Shows Volatile Industry’s Decay BP Plc (BP/) may get less than half the $2.85 billion it planned for selling its Texas City refinery, the third-largest in the U.S., as values for U.S. plants haven’t kept pace with soaring profits.

Whatever they bid, they’re not going to pay full price.” Viability Doubts Surging profits haven’t quieted doubts about the long-term viability of an industry facing declining demand in the U.S. and Europe and steep up-down cycles, said Harold York, a vice president for Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Houston. “We’re in a boom, but they are fearing the bust and they don’t know when it’s going to happen,” York said. “Buyers see refineries are profitable today, but long term, they don’t want to be losing money with an asset they can’t dispose of.” Buyers fear that competition from new refineries planned in China, India and the Middle East may depress domestic prices and damp a burgeoning U.S. export business. As new pipelines including TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone XL are built to ship oil from Canada and North Dakota to the U.S. Gulf Coast, U.S. crude prices are likely to rise, diminishing a key cost advantage for U.S. refiners and shrinking profits, York said. Potential Buyers Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the largest independent processor of fuel in the U.S., has closely studied buying the refinery, according to a person familiar with the San Antonio-based company’s plans. Valero owns a 245,000 barrel-a-day refinery that is adjacent to the BP facility in Texas City. Combining the two plants would create the largest refinery in the U.S. The person spoke on a condition of anonymity as the talks aren’t public. Valero and PBF Energy Inc. (PBF) , a private equity-backed independent refiner run by former Philipp Brothers trader and refining magnate Thomas O’Malley, are the two most likely buyers, said Christian O’Neill, a Bloomberg Industries energy analyst. Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) , which also has a Texas City refinery, and Phillips 66 (PSX) , which abandoned plans to sell one of its plants in Louisiana, may also be suitors given a potentially lower price, O’Neill said. The Texas City refinery might be more attractive to independent refiners if they could buy the asset for a bargain price, then cash in on improving profits. Rising Shares Bill Day , a spokesman for Valero, and Scott Dean , a spokesman for London-based BP, declined to comment. Marathon, Phillips 66 and Icahn-backed CVR Energy Inc. (CVI) surged to records this month as refiners continued to earn the highest profits since 2007, when the industry enjoyed a so- called “golden age” because of higher U.S. demand and fuel margins. Valero, which is up 49 percent this year, climbed on September 14 to its highest point in four years. The rally has attracted investors such as David Tepper ’s Appaloosa, which owned 2.3 million Valero shares as of June 30. Buffett’s Berkshire owned 27.1 million shares of Phillips, which has risen 42 percent since its April 30 spinoff from ConocoPhillips. CVR Energy is up 97 percent after Icahn bought a stake in January and agitated for the company to put itself up for sale. Amid a proxy fight, he offered investors $30 a share and now holds an 82 percent stake in the company. CVR reached an all- time high of $37.66 on September 21 in New York. Refining Renaissance The latest refining renaissance has been spurred by growing supplies of cheap U.S. oil. Crude prices have dropped as producers tap into new fields in North Dakota and Texas, allowing refiners to save money on every barrel of oil they turn into gasoline, diesel or jet fuel. The margin between U.S. oil costs and fuel prices reached an average of $28.98 from April to June, the highest-ever second-quarter price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, the value of the plants that process the fuel has reached historic lows based on an industry yardstick that compares the price at which a plant sells with how much it would cost to replace it, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Industries. Plants have sold for about 12 percent of their replacement cost since 2009, which would result in a price of $1 billion for the refinery. The historical average is between 20 percent and 30 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lower Price Analysts also use price per barrel of refining capacity to evaluate plant sales. Since 2009, 11 refineries have sold for an average of $3,128 a barrel, according to transactional data compiled by Bloomberg. On that basis, the refinery may have a price tag of $1.5 billion, leaving the company about $1.72 billion short of its $4.4 billion goal for the two refineries. The lower price may force BP to put other assets on the block, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. BP initially expected its refineries to sell for more than the 10-year average of $6,000 a barrel of refining capacity, Iain Conn , the company’s head of refining and marketing, said in February 2011. Last month, BP announced an agreement to sell its refinery and related assets in Carson, California for $1.18 billion, or about $4,417 a barrel of processing capacity. To reach the $4.4 billion target for the two plants, BP’s Texas City refinery would have to sell for $3.2 billion, more than double the average since 2009. The Carson refinery sale and BP’s $5.55 billion divestiture of its stakes in a group of Gulf of Mexico fields last week raised to $32 billion the company’s total asset sales since 2010. The company aims to raise $38 billion from divestitures by the end of 2013 after a 2010 explosion at its Macondo well in the Gulf killed 11 workers. BP Pressure “If BP does come up short, they’ll have to go farther down their list of assets to sell,” said Youngberg, who rates BP’s American Depository Receipts a hold and doesn’t own shares. “They’ve got to meet the guidance number they’ve provided for investors to get more comfortable.” The history of BP’s Texas City plant, site of one of the most deadly refining accidents in 20 years, may be another deterrent to buyers, said Turner Mason’s Auers. BP pleaded guilty to a violation of the Clean Air Act and paid a $50 million fine. The company also paid $2.1 billion in settlements with blast victims. BP agreed in July to pay more than $13 million in additional fines and continues to negotiate with the U.S. Department of Labor about more than 20 remaining citations. BP spent $1 billion to upgrade production units and improve safety at the plant, the company has said. “Refinery sales are challenging all over the world due to the economic slowdown we’re seeing in many markets,” said Gianna Bern , president of risk-management consultant Brookshire Advisory and Research, Inc. “This refinery is a tough sell for the associated liabilities that could go with it. That all manifests itself in a lackluster price tag.” To contact the reporter on this story: Bradley Olson in Houston at  bradleyolson@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Susan Warren at  susanwarren@bloomberg.net",8294,1412,3
Nissan Leads Japan Auto Shares Lower as China Concerns Rise,['Bloomberg News'],2012-09-26 03:27:38,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/nissan-leads-japan-auto-shares-lower-as-china-concerns-escalate.html,"Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , the top Japanese seller of vehicles in China, led automakers lower in Tokyo trading on mounting concerns about the economic fallout from a territorial dispute between Asia ’s two biggest economies. The maker of the Altima sedan fell as much as 3.2 percent to 660 yen in Tokyo trading, while Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) declined as much as 2.7 percent. Honda Motor Co. (7267) , the nation’s third- largest carmaker, dropped as much as 5 percent. Nissan said today it’s halting Chinese production three days ahead of schedule to reflect current demand, while Toyota said that it’s adjusting output in the country. The carmakers, who reeled from natural disasters in Japan and Thailand last year, may face an even bigger financial toll from the anti- Japanese protests in the world’s biggest automobile market, according to China ’s Passenger Car Association. “In previous years, they often added shifts around this time to meet rising demand during hot sales season in September and October,” said Han Weiqi, a Shanghai-based analyst with CSC International Holdings Ltd. “Japanese automakers will see their market share being taken away by American and European automakers, as consumers who need to buy cars will simply turn away and buy other brands.” Nissan will suspend production in China from Sept. 27 and resume output on Oct. 8 in view of the “current market situation,” Chris Keeffe, a company spokesman, said by telephone today. The company makes cars in the country with Dongfeng Motor Corp. China Production Toyota will adjust production in China to meet demand, said spokesman Joichi Tachikawa. The Asahi newspaper earlier reported the automaker plans to produce no cars in the country in October. Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) is suspending output at its venture two days earlier than usual for China’s national holidays next month as the plants prepare for production of the CX-5 model next year, according to Michiko Terashima, a company spokeswoman. The automaker is still assessing the impact of the anti-Japan strife, Terashima said. Honda President Takanobu Ito said Sept. 21 that while the company’s plans to strengthen its China business remains unchanged, the automaker hasn’t fully recovered from the earlier suspension due to parts procurement and safety concerns. Sales Decline Sales of Japanese-branded passenger cars fell last month in China, compared with gains of more than 10 percent for German automakers including Volkswagen AG (VOW) and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , after tensions flared over a long-standing territorial dispute involving a group of islands known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. American brands sold by General Motors Co. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. (F) also rose last month. The impact on Japanese car sales will extend into next month as escalating tensions deter consumers, said Akio Toyoda , president of Toyota and chairman of Japan’s auto association, on Sept. 20. “If the Chinese, Koreans and maybe the Taiwanese are not willing to buy Japanese cars, the sales of Japanese automakers will suffer, and so will their share prices,” said Yuuki Sakurai , President of Fukoku Capital Management. “You can’t leave the Chinese market but you may try to move the production line out of China for the time being. It depends on how they are going to cover their risks.” Financial Toll Many dealerships in China that sell Japanese cars shut after some showrooms were attacked and vandalized this month, according to Luo Lei, deputy secretary general of the state- backed China Automobile Dealers Association. The sales declines will likely hurt the Japanese manufacturers more than last year’s earthquake and tsunami, which closed factories across Japan , Luo said. The Shanghai-based Passenger Car Association predicts Japanese brands will lose their lead over German nameplates in the country for the first time since 2005. Some dealerships selling competing brands have introduced marketing campaigns to attract buyers shunning Japanese cars. A Buick showroom in eastern Zhejiang province is offering cash rebates and gift bags to buyers who trade in their Japanese cars, according to Chen Linling, a saleswoman at the dealership. “Business has been quite good and we’ve been busy since we started the promotion,” Chen said by telephone. “We rolled out this marketing move after the Diaoyu protests in China.” Patriot SUV Hawtai Motor Group Co., the Beijing-based carmaker whose sport utility vehicle is outsold more than 50-to-1 by Honda’s CR-V, urged Chinese consumers to buy local brands as it introduces this week a “Patriot” edition of its Boliger SUV featuring a paint job with a stylized China national flag. “As a Chinese, purchasing China’s homegrown auto brands is the most efficient and direct way to support our country’s national economy,” Hawtai said in the statement. Consumers should drive the Boliger Patriot and “fill the streets with the songs of patriotism praising our mighty nation.” Some dealers have taken extreme measures to capitalize on anti-Japan sentiment. Volkswagen’s Audi said earlier this month it asked a Chinese dealer to remove a banner advocating the murder of Japanese people after a photograph of the sign went viral on the Internet. China’s homegrown automakers have lost a quarter of their market share in the past two years, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers data.

Euro Can Bear Fewer Members as Klaus Calls Greeks Victims,['Laura Zelenko'],2012-09-26 22:06:58,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/euro-can-bear-losing-members-as-czech-leader-says-greece-victim.html,"The exit of one or more member states from the euro won’t destroy the monetary union or the project of European integration, Czech President Vaclav Klaus said. And a Greek departure from the currency would be a “victory” for that country, which has been a victim of the monetary system, Klaus said yesterday in an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York. The Czech Republic , which pledged to adopt the euro as part of its agreement to join the European Union in 2004, is under no official deadline to do so and the question of joining the common currency is a “non-issue” in the country, said Klaus, whose second term as president expires in March. “I don’t think the euro as a currency disappears,” Klaus, 71, said. “The issue is whether all of the 17 countries and potentially a few others should be or will be in this system or not.” European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said July 26 he would do “whatever it takes” to save the 17-nation euro zone. That challenged the view of skeptics including Kenneth Rogoff , an economics professor at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts , who said the same month he expected Greece to leave the common currency after undergoing the largest ever sovereign-debt restructuring. Klaus, who as Czech prime minister oversaw the Jan. 1, 1993 split of what was then Czechoslovakia and the subsequent adoption of separate Czech and Slovak currencies, said the euro- zone system is punishing some countries that would be better off pulling out. Greece ‘a Victim’ “Greece is a victim of the monetary union,” he said. “It would be much better for them not to be in the straightjacket. It would be a victory for them.” Klaus, an economist who studied in the U.S. and Italy and worked at the Czechoslovak central bank under communism, served as finance minister and then prime minister following the 1989 Velvet Revolution that ended the communist regime. He has been president since February 2003, when he replaced his political rival, Vaclav Havel. The president is in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly and promote his new book, “ Europe : The Shattering of Illusions.” He called himself a “euro-realist,” saying he supports European integration while not embracing the shift towards “unification, centralization, harmonization, standardization” of the whole continent, including the single currency. “We accepted with some reluctance the prepared conditions for our entry” into the EU, Klaus said. “We were aware of the fact that joining the euro system was one of the conditions. But we are quite happy with the fact that there was no timing. No One ‘Pushing’ “So perhaps in the year 2074 we can join the European Monetary Union as well,” he said. “No one is pushing us.” The Czech koruna was the world’s best performer against the euro in the decade ended December 2010, advancing 40 percent. Investor confidence in the Czech economy is reflected in the nation’s 10-year local-currency debt, which yields 2.4 percent, compared with 4.8 percent for similar-maturity Polish bonds and 7.2 percent for Hungary ’s. Regional apprehension about the euro has grown with Europe’s debt crisis. While euro-zone nations purchase more than half of the exports of eastern European nations, seven of the 10 former communist countries to join the EU since 2004 have yet to adopt the currency. Poland , which three years ago shelved plans to join in 2013, deems the euro “completely unattractive,” Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in July. Hungary won’t adopt the currency before 2018, Premier Viktor Orban said in March. Bulgaria has indefinitely delayed plans to scrap the lev, Prime Minister Boyko Borisov told the Wall Street Journal in a Sept. 4 interview. Economy Contracted The European debt crisis is taking a toll on the Czech Republic, whose economy contracted in the first two quarters of 2012 amid weaker demand in the euro region, its main market for Skoda cars, television monitors and other Czech-made goods. Exports account for about 75 percent of Czech GDP. The koruna has increased about 2 percent against the euro this year, compared with 10 percent for the Hungarian forint and 8 percent for the Polish zloty. Klaus touted his experience in dissolving Czechoslovakia into separate Czech and Slovak nations and abandoning initial plans to maintain a common currency when Slovak officials said they wanted to devalue after the separation. The split of the Czechoslovak currency was a non-event because the Czech government was prepared, he said. Managed Departure “It’s technically possible,” to manage the departure from a common currency, Klaus said. “It’s not true what all the politicians are saying about disastrous consequences. You have to do it in an organized way. You can’t allow an anarchy situation.” Rogoff, a former International Monetary Fund chief economist, told Tom Keene on “Bloomberg Surveillance” July 27 that he expected Greece to “ultimately” leave the euro and that “the real question is what is going to happen to the broader euro.” Chances of a breakup of the monetary union by the end of 2013 fell to 47.1 percent yesterday from more than 60 percent in late July, according to Dublin-based Intrade.com data, after Draghi gave details earlier this month of a plan announced in August to buy debt of members including Spain and Italy. As he approaches the end of his term, Klaus said his most important legacy is his role as Czechoslovak finance minister after the fall of communism, when he helped open up the economy, set a new exchange rate and create new political and social systems. “That moment was the change,” Klaus said. “Everything else is really making small marginal changes, for the better or worse.” To contact the reporters on this story: Laura Zelenko in New York at  lzelenko@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: John Fraher at jfraher@bloomberg,net",['Laura Zelenko'],"Euro Can Bear Fewer Members as Klaus Calls Greeks Victims The exit of one or more member states from the euro won’t destroy the monetary union or the project of European integration, Czech President Vaclav Klaus said.

Poland , which three years ago shelved plans to join in 2013, deems the euro “completely unattractive,” Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in July. Hungary won’t adopt the currency before 2018, Premier Viktor Orban said in March. Bulgaria has indefinitely delayed plans to scrap the lev, Prime Minister Boyko Borisov told the Wall Street Journal in a Sept. 4 interview. Economy Contracted The European debt crisis is taking a toll on the Czech Republic, whose economy contracted in the first two quarters of 2012 amid weaker demand in the euro region, its main market for Skoda cars, television monitors and other Czech-made goods. Exports account for about 75 percent of Czech GDP. The koruna has increased about 2 percent against the euro this year, compared with 10 percent for the Hungarian forint and 8 percent for the Polish zloty. Klaus touted his experience in dissolving Czechoslovakia into separate Czech and Slovak nations and abandoning initial plans to maintain a common currency when Slovak officials said they wanted to devalue after the separation. The split of the Czechoslovak currency was a non-event because the Czech government was prepared, he said. Managed Departure “It’s technically possible,” to manage the departure from a common currency, Klaus said. “It’s not true what all the politicians are saying about disastrous consequences. You have to do it in an organized way. You can’t allow an anarchy situation.” Rogoff, a former International Monetary Fund chief economist, told Tom Keene on “Bloomberg Surveillance” July 27 that he expected Greece to “ultimately” leave the euro and that “the real question is what is going to happen to the broader euro.” Chances of a breakup of the monetary union by the end of 2013 fell to 47.1 percent yesterday from more than 60 percent in late July, according to Dublin-based Intrade.com data, after Draghi gave details earlier this month of a plan announced in August to buy debt of members including Spain and Italy. As he approaches the end of his term, Klaus said his most important legacy is his role as Czechoslovak finance minister after the fall of communism, when he helped open up the economy, set a new exchange rate and create new political and social systems. “That moment was the change,” Klaus said. “Everything else is really making small marginal changes, for the better or worse.” To contact the reporters on this story: Laura Zelenko in New York at  lzelenko@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: John Fraher at jfraher@bloomberg,net",5962,985,5

Toyota Joins Nissan in Saying Deeper China Output Cuts Loom,['Ma Jie' 'Yuki Hagiwara'],2012-09-26 08:10:05,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/toyota-joins-nissan-in-cutting-china-output-on-anti-japan-strife.html,"Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Nissan Motor Co. (7201) and Honda Motor Co. (7267) signaled Chinese production cuts may deepen this month after anti-Japanese protests flared in the world’s largest vehicle market. Nissan lowered August output in China, its largest market by volume, 8.9 percent from a year earlier to 86,488 units, the Japanese carmaker said today. Chinese production fell 18 percent to 67,625 vehicles at Toyota, Asia ’s biggest automaker, and declined 10 percent at Honda. Officials at the Japanese automakers said sales and production are poised to worsen in September after anti-Japan protests over disputed islets in the East China Sea escalated, with some demonstrators torching auto showrooms and smashing cars. Japanese autos will lose their lead this year over German nameplates in the country for the first time since 2005, China’s Passenger Car Association estimates. “You can’t leave the Chinese market, but you may try to move the production line out of China for the time being,” said Yuuki Sakurai , president of Fukoku Capital Management. Investor demand for the automakers’ shares “depends on how the companies are going to cover these risks,” he said. Nissan fell 2.6 percent to 664 yen at the close in Tokyo trading, while Toyota dropped 2.7 percent and Honda declined 4.2 percent. Market Share “The impact from the anti-Japan protests are not yet reflected in the August numbers,” said Yurika Motoyoshi, a Toyota spokeswoman. “Last year’s numbers were unusually high as we recovered from the earthquake and tsunami. We’ve already seen that orders are declining, so the protests’ impact will be shown in the September numbers.” Nissan said today it’s halting Chinese production three days ahead of schedule to reflect demand, while Toyota said that it’s suspending output from today until Oct. 8 at plants in Guangzhou and Tianjin, and at its Sichuan FAW plant starting Sept. 29. Nissan will suspend production in China from Sept. 27 and resume output on Oct. 8 in view of the “current market situation,” Chris Keeffe, a spokesman for the company, said by telephone today. The company makes cars in the country with Dongfeng Motor Corp. (489)  “In previous years, they often added shifts around this time to meet rising demand during hot sales season in September and October,” said Han Weiqi, a Shanghai-based analyst with CSC International Holdings Ltd. “Japanese automakers will see their market share being taken away by American and European automakers, as consumers who need to buy cars will simply turn away and buy other brands.” Declining Share Japanese car brands’ China market share will probably fall to 22 percent this year, while German marques will increase theirs to 22.5 percent, according to China’s Passenger Car Association. Combined sales of Japanese automakers fell last month in China, compared with gains of more than 10 percent for German, U.S. and South Korean vehicles, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Some dealerships selling competing brands have introduced marketing campaigns to attract buyers shunning Japanese cars. A Buick showroom in eastern Zhejiang province is offering cash rebates and gift bags to buyers who trade in their Japanese cars, according to Chen Linling, a saleswoman at the dealership. “Business has been quite good and we’ve been busy since we started the promotion,” Chen said by telephone. “We rolled out this marketing move after the Diaoyu protests in China.” Korea Dispute A similar dispute over sovereignty of islands known as Dokdo in South Korea and Takeshima in Japan has drawn more attention since South Korean President Lee Myung Bak visited the islands on Aug. 10. Japanese auto sales also fell in South Korea last month. Taiwan also claims sovereignty over the islets China calls Daiyou and Japan named Senkaku. “If the Chinese, Koreans and maybe the Taiwanese are not willing to buy Japanese cars, the sales of Japanese automakers will suffer, and so will their share prices,” Sakurai of Fukoku Capital said. Total sales of Japanese carmakers in South Korea dropped 12 percent and importers attributed the decline to the dispute, according to a statement e-mailed from the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Japanese carmakers had been increasingly looking toward China sales as the end of a government subsidy for fuel- efficient cars in Japan stymied domestic demand growth. Nissan generates about 30 percent of its profit in China, compared with 17 percent at Toyota and 15 percent at Honda, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates. Toyota will adjust Kyushu plant output as demand fell in China, it said yesterday. Toyota makes mostly Lexus vehicles at plant in the southwestern Japan island.

Baoshan Steel Halting Production at China Factory,['Bloomberg News'],2012-09-27 10:55:35,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/baoshan-steel-halting-production-at-china-factory.html,"Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019) , China ’s largest listed steelmaker, suspended production at a plant after demand fell for slabs used to make ships and bridges. “A downturn in demand in the downstream slab market” prompted the stoppage, the company said in a statement to Shanghai’s stock exchange yesterday, without elaborating on when production may resume. Production was suspended “to avoid increasing our operating losses,” it said. Steel demand has plunged as economic growth in China, the biggest consumer and producer of the metal, slowed to the weakest since 2009 as a result of the European debt crisis and a campaign to rein in the property market. Steel reinforcement-bar prices in China have fallen more than 15 percent from the high reached on April 12 and Australia cut estimates for Chinese iron ore demand for 2012 and 2013 this month. “The bigger issue is not what this one mill represents, but at prices at this low level, all the mills are under pressure,” Kuni Chen, an analyst at CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford , Connecticut , said by telephone. “I’d expect to see more production shuts, but this becomes a vicious cycle where production declines, then raw materials decline, and steel prices continue to decline.” Baoshan Steel rose 0.7 percent to 4.57 yuan at the close in Shanghai today. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.6 percent. Corex Plants The plant where production is being halted is located in Luojing, China, about 35 kilometers (22 miles) north of Shanghai, the company said. It includes two money-losing Corex and steel-processing facilities with a combined capacity of 3 million metric tons annually, Meng Haibiao, a media official at parent Baosteel Group Corp. said by phone. Corex technology enables manufacturers to make steel from iron-ore pellets and unprocessed or non-coking coal, which is at least 30 percent cheaper than regular coking coal. Baoshan will move the Corex plants out of Shanghai, Meng said, without elaborating. Baosteel, which supplies half of China’s automobile steel, reported a 60 percent decline in first-half operating profit. Net income rose on the sale of its stainless-steel and specialty-steel units to its parent. Hot-rolled steel coil , a benchmark product used in cars and appliances, dropped 9.1 percent this year to $629.17 a ton, according to data from Steel Business Briefing. Steel reinforcement-bar futures in Shanghai fell more than 20 percent in the first eight months of this year. Contracting Manufacturing A report today by the National Bureau of Statistics showed Chinese industrial companies’ profits fell 6.2 percent from a year earlier in August, after falling 5.4 percent in July. Last week, a preliminary reading of a Chinese purchasing managers’ index by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics signaled manufacturing may have contracted an 11th straight month in September. Steel production in China, the world’s biggest producer of the metal, reached a seven-month low in August, according to Steel Market Intelligence. “We would need to see cutback announcements similar to this from other larger producers who typically buy the bulk of their raw materials on a contract basis in order to say that we are beginning to see supply rationalization on a larger scale,” Andrew Cosgrove, an analyst at Bloomberg Industries, said in an e-mail. ArcelorMittal (MT) , based in Luxembourg , China’s Hebei Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. and closely held Anshan Iron & Steel Group Corp. were the world’s three biggest steelmakers by production last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. China Ore Imports “China has more than 150 million tons of spare capacity, so reaching a meaningful cutback number is highly unlikely given that steel plants are large sources of employment,” Cosgrove said. Australia’s Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics on Sept. 18 cut this year’s forecast for Chinese iron ore imports to 672 million tons from 699 million tons. BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company, said the next day that the pace of demand from China has slowed by more than 50 percent.

GM-Peugeot Discussion Said to Slow While Economy Worsens,['David Welch' 'Tim Higgins'],2012-09-27 09:38:35,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/gm-peugeot-discussion-said-to-slow-while-economy-worsens.html,"General Motors Co. (GM) and PSA Peugeot Citroen’s efforts to deepen their alliance have slowed recently amid a worsening European auto market and complicated regulatory review, people familiar with the matter said. The companies have already missed a June 30 deadline on the parts-buying plan. The automakers also aimed to announce as soon as this week at the Paris Motor Show more details on plans to jointly build four model lines using common underpinnings and to combine purchasing efforts, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal negotiations. “The broader an alliance gets, the more complex it is,” Juergen Reers, a partner with Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, a consulting firm in Munich, said yesterday in a telephone interview. The weakening European economy and the companies’ different processes for developing cars have hindered progress, the people said, underscoring the challenge of synchronizing operations in an industry where products are planned years in advance. The automakers outlined in February a sweeping alliance to save $2 billion a year. GM bought 7 percent of Peugeot (UG) in the deal. November Target Peugeot Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin said today at the Paris show that while a joint purchasing agreement requires regulatory approval it should be achieved in November. Frederic Saint-Geours, the company’s vice president for brands, told journalists at the show that alliance projects will be achieved by the year’s end and that talks are not being delayed. Johan Willems, a GM spokesman, said yesterday that “things are going very well” as the purchasing plan awaits approvals. “We’re going through that, and it doesn’t make sense to do anything, to sign anything definite, until these things are done,” he said. “From our perspective, we are on track.” The companies hadn’t planned to reveal greater details this week, said Kelly Cusinato, a GM spokeswoman. GM said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission it aimed to sign agreements with Peugeot on product- development, vehicle-supply and powertrain-supply plans by the end of October. Cycle Plans GM announced a logistics agreement with PSA on July 2, more than two months after the April 30 deadline set out in the automakers’ Feb. 29 master agreement filed with the SEC. Willems disputed the idea that Europe’s worsening economy is slowing the alliance efforts. “There’s a lot of pressure for ourselves to deliver and not to slow things down,” he said. Making joint ventures and alliances work can be very challenging because carmakers have complex product plans that extend years into the future, said Reers of Roland Berger. “The cycle plans for similar vehicles aren’t aligned,” he said. “So one of the two companies can have access to a new platform earlier than the other and end up with a competitive advantage.” GM’s German Opel brand has looked at basing most of its model range on platforms developed by Peugeot, said one of the people familiar with the talks. The next Opel Astra hatchback, the unit’s best-selling model and competitor to the Peugeot 308, won’t use Peugeot underpinnings, because it’s too far along in development, the person said. European Losses The alliance was announced on Feb. 29, weeks before either automaker planned because of leaks about the talks, said one of the people. This left more terms to be worked on than is typical after a deal is made public, the person said. Vehicle sales, pricing and economic conditions in Europe have also been worse than either side forecast when the agreement was struck, the person said.

(GM) and PSA Peugeot Citroen’s efforts to deepen their alliance have slowed recently amid a worsening European auto market and complicated regulatory review, people familiar with the matter said. The companies have already missed a June 30 deadline on the parts-buying plan. The automakers also aimed to announce as soon as this week at the Paris Motor Show more details on plans to jointly build four model lines using common underpinnings and to combine purchasing efforts, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal negotiations. “The broader an alliance gets, the more complex it is,” Juergen Reers, a partner with Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, a consulting firm in Munich, said yesterday in a telephone interview. The weakening European economy and the companies’ different processes for developing cars have hindered progress, the people said, underscoring the challenge of synchronizing operations in an industry where products are planned years in advance. The automakers outlined in February a sweeping alliance to save $2 billion a year. GM bought 7 percent of Peugeot (UG) in the deal. November Target Peugeot Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin said today at the Paris show that while a joint purchasing agreement requires regulatory approval it should be achieved in November. Frederic Saint-Geours, the company’s vice president for brands, told journalists at the show that alliance projects will be achieved by the year’s end and that talks are not being delayed. Johan Willems, a GM spokesman, said yesterday that “things are going very well” as the purchasing plan awaits approvals. “We’re going through that, and it doesn’t make sense to do anything, to sign anything definite, until these things are done,” he said. “From our perspective, we are on track.” The companies hadn’t planned to reveal greater details this week, said Kelly Cusinato, a GM spokeswoman. GM said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission it aimed to sign agreements with Peugeot on product- development, vehicle-supply and powertrain-supply plans by the end of October. Cycle Plans GM announced a logistics agreement with PSA on July 2, more than two months after the April 30 deadline set out in the automakers’ Feb. 29 master agreement filed with the SEC. Willems disputed the idea that Europe’s worsening economy is slowing the alliance efforts. “There’s a lot of pressure for ourselves to deliver and not to slow things down,” he said. Making joint ventures and alliances work can be very challenging because carmakers have complex product plans that extend years into the future, said Reers of Roland Berger. “The cycle plans for similar vehicles aren’t aligned,” he said. “So one of the two companies can have access to a new platform earlier than the other and end up with a competitive advantage.” GM’s German Opel brand has looked at basing most of its model range on platforms developed by Peugeot, said one of the people familiar with the talks. The next Opel Astra hatchback, the unit’s best-selling model and competitor to the Peugeot 308, won’t use Peugeot underpinnings, because it’s too far along in development, the person said. European Losses The alliance was announced on Feb. 29, weeks before either automaker planned because of leaks about the talks, said one of the people. This left more terms to be worked on than is typical after a deal is made public, the person said. Vehicle sales, pricing and economic conditions in Europe have also been worse than either side forecast when the agreement was struck, the person said.

Swiss Stocks Drop the Most in Three Weeks; Myriad Tumbles,['Corinne Gretler' 'Jonathan Morgan'],2012-09-26 15:50:49,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/swiss-stocks-drop-the-most-in-three-weeks-myriad-tumbles.html,"Swiss stocks fell the most in three weeks after Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said the latest round of quantitative easing may not boost growth or hiring in the world’s largest economy. Myriad Group AG (MYRN) plunged to the lowest price on record after the software developer reported a wider first-half loss and unveiled a rights offer. Dufry AG, the operator of Hudson News stores in airports, lost 7.9 percent after UBS AG (UBSN) lowered its recommendation for the stock. The Swiss Market Index dropped 1.1 percent to 6,540.41 at the close in Zurich, after rising yesterday to the highest since March 1, 2011. The gauge has still rallied 14 percent from this year’s low on June 4 as the Fed and European Central Bank started bond-buying programs. The broader Swiss Performance Index also slipped 1.1 percent today. “Sentiment in equity markets is deteriorating somewhat after all major central banks have delivered on their promises and done their part,” said Alessandro Fezzi, senior market analyst at LGT Capital Management AG in Pfaeffikon, Switzerland. “I think markets have entered a consolidation phase and it will need better-than-expected economic data to support the stock market.” Plosser said late yesterday that new bond buying announced by the Fed this month probably won’t boost growth or hiring and may jeopardize the central bank’s credibility. Quantitative Easing The Federal Open Market Committee said on Sept. 13 that it will undertake a third round of quantitative easing by purchasing mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month until labor markets “improve substantially.” In Spain, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has struggled to persuade people to accept the deepest austerity measures on record. Unions and protest groups, spurred by the Portuguese government’s decision to drop a planned tax increase following demonstrations, have demanded a referendum on Rajoy’s cuts. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos will present additional measures tomorrow that the European Commission requires as part of efforts to bring down Spain’s borrowing costs. Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro will unveil the 2013 budget. Myriad plunged 14 percent to 2.09 Swiss francs, its lowest price since selling shares to the public in September 2005. The company reported a first-half net loss of $23.3 million, compared with a net loss of $4.6 million a year earlier. Myriad said it will raise 10 million francs ($10.7 million) in a fully underwritten rights issue. The company also said Chief Executive Officer Simon Wilkinson resigned. Dufry, UBS Dufry (DUFN) tumbled 7.9 percent to 111.9 francs, its largest decline since September 2011. UBS downgraded the shares of the operator of duty-free shops to neutral from buy. UBS slid 4.3 percent to 11.55 francs, contributing the most to the SMI’s loss. Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s second-largest lender, tumbled 4.2 percent to 20.20 francs, the deepest slump since June 14. The bank is considering combining its asset- management unit with the private and investment-banking divisions, according to a person familiar with the matter. Georg Fischer AG (FI/N) retreated 2.1 percent to 340.5 francs. Torsten Wyss, an analyst at UBS, cut his price estimate for Europe’s biggest maker of iron castings for cars by 8 percent to 460 francs.

Apple Moves Toward a Google-Free Future: Rich Jaroslovsky,['Rich Jaroslovsky'],2012-09-26 21:21:17,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/apple-moves-toward-a-google-free-future-rich-jaroslovsky.html,"The new version of iOS, the software that runs Apple’s iPhones and iPads, may be more important for what was taken away than for any of the things added. Gone from iOS 6 are two formerly built-in Google (GOOG) apps that were integral to previous versions of the operating system: Google Maps and YouTube. (The latter, at least, can be reinstalled from the App Store .) Google’s search capability is still there, but Apple’s improvements to Siri, its voice-based personal assistant, provide an alternative way of finding more and more information. And a new Apple app called Passbook represents a toe in the water of mobile payments, something Google has aggressively been pursuing with its Google Wallet software. In short, while iOS 6 introduces some neat tricks into the iUniverse, it feels less like a major enhancement and more like another front in Apple’s increasingly bitter war over Google’s Android operating system. The new software comes pre-installed on the iPhone 5 and is available as a free download for iPads, iPod touches and previous iPhones. I tested it on a variety of devices, ranging from a current-model iPad to a three-generations-old iPhone 3GS, and found it smooth, stable and responsive. Panoramic Photos I also appreciated several of its new features, including bringing Siri to the iPad for the first time and allowing the iPhone 4S to take the same kind of panoramic photographs as the iPhone 5. But the change that’s grabbed the most public attention is the new Apple navigation app that has supplanted Google Maps. As I wrote in my iPhone 5 review last week, while the new app is gorgeous and the spoken turn-by-turn directions are a welcome addition, the software is too easily confused. In addition, it displays many fewer nearby points of interest. In light of the furor over the app’s flaws, it’s worth noting that Google Maps suffered from similar problems when it launched on Android phones in 2009. Most memorably, while I was standing outside New York ’s Penn Station , it located me on Cheapside in London , even helpfully pointing out nearby Tube stations. Still, it’s obvious by now that the new application is inferior to the one it replaced, and I expect Apple to devote considerable resources to remedy it. Smarter Siri It’s a path similar to the one the company is already following with Siri, which was introduced last year on the iPhone 4S. The voice assistant has proven to be a polarizing feature, some users enjoying the convenience of just talking to their devices and others disliking it for its miscues. In general, I’m in the first camp, and like Siri’s new tricks. She -- it? -- now provides sports scores (and even sometimes point spreads), can make dinner reservations via Open Table , passes fewer queries to Google web searches and has generally gotten better at understanding what I want. For instance, when I asked the first version of Siri for directions to San Francisco ’s 9 Lombard Street, she interpreted the “to” as “two,” and sent me to 29 Lombard Street; the software now interprets the question accurately. And the query “Do I need a jacket?” now yields weather information, rather than a list of nearby Men’s Wearhouse (MW) stores. The most intriguing new app in iOS 6 may be Passbook -- not necessarily for what it does now but for what it may do someday. Location Aware Passbook is basically a single place for keeping tickets, boarding passes, loyalty and prepaid cards. But it has some wrinkles, like location and time awareness, that hint at more to come. I used Passbook to store a ticket to a San Francisco Giants baseball game by clicking on an e-mailed link. When I arrived at AT&T (T) Park, my iPhone recognized where I was and displayed a message on the lock screen prompting me to display the ticket. At the turnstile, the electronic ticket was scanned, and I was in. Easy. Beyond the colorful look and slick animation -- you’ll have fun virtually shredding used tickets -- there’s nothing very revolutionary about an e-mailed bar or QR code. But the idea of presenting you with relevant information and offers, based on your device’s awareness of where you are and what you’re doing, is a critical step toward getting consumers to reach for their phones rather than their wallets to pay for stuff. Simple Pleasures A number of iOS 6’s 200 or so other changes amount to simple pleasures. For instance, a handy new Do Not Disturb setting lets you silence your device between specified hours, while allowing you to note who should be allowed through, and under what terms. Receive a call when you’re in a meeting or otherwise engaged? A finger-flick sends an automatic can’t-talk-now text. And if your data plan allows it, you can now conduct a FaceTime video chat over the cellular network. Along similar lines, Mail lets you designate messages from VIPs in your life for special attention. You can post to Facebook (FB) as well as Twitter from the Notification Center and from within many apps. And you can also now share access to your iCloud-stored photos, perhaps one less reason you’d need to use You-Know-Who-owned Picasa. Indeed, given Apple’s war with Google, it isn’t that far- fetched to imagine a day when even core search functions are handled by some Apple-designed replacement. But if the company wants to retain its reputation for putting the user experience ahead of all else, it had better be sure that anything it introduces is better than whatever it’s replacing.

Google’s Driverless Cars Permitted by New California Law,['Michael B.Marois'],2012-09-26 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/google-s-driverless-cars-permitted-by-new-california-law.html,"Self-driving cars will soon motor around the most populous U.S. state, at least on a test basis, after a law written with the help of Google Inc. (GOOG) was signed by California Governor Jerry Brown. The law signed yesterday allows trials of autonomous vehicles on the state’s roadways as long as there’s a licensed human in the driver’s seat to take over if needed. “Today we are looking at science fiction become tomorrow’s reality,” Brown said at a signing ceremony at Google’s headquarters in Mountain View , California. Google, the operator of the world’s largest Internet search engine, has modified a Toyota Prius that drives itself using video cameras, radar sensors, a laser rangefinder and detailed maps. The vehicle includes a failsafe mechanism that lets the driver take control by grabbing the steering wheel or hitting the brakes, much like the override on a cruise control. While major carmakers are working on self-driving prototypes and rolling out semi-autonomous features such as parking assistance, lane-departure warning systems and adaptive cruise control, it’s Google’s car that inspired the push for regulatory clearance first in Nevada last year and now in California. “Anybody who gets into a car and finds the car driving itself is going to be skittish at first,” said Brown, who took a test ride. “But they will get over it.” The law directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to develop regulations governing the licensing, bonding, testing and operation of autonomous vehicles. Google’s shares were little changed at $749.16 in New York yesterday, one day after reaching a record $749.38, the highest since its initial public offering in August 2004.

Foxconn Workers Labor Under Guard After Riot Shuts Plant,['Bloomberg News'],2012-09-27 01:56:07,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/foxconn-workers-labor-under-police-watch-after-riot-shuts-plant.html,"Security teams wearing riot helmets and wielding plastic shields marched around a Foxconn Technology Group factory in northern China in a sign that tensions remain high after a fight between 2,000 workers halted production. Foxconn’s complex, home to 79,000 workers in Taiyuan, Shanxi province, still shows damage caused by a Sept. 23 clash in which a dormitory fight escalated into a riot finally quelled by hundreds of security guards and police. More than 40 people were hospitalized in the melee that left shattered windows and damaged parked cars across the campus. Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou has moved to improve conditions at his factories in recent years, after a spate of suicides and pressure from the company’s largest customer, Apple Inc. (AAPL) The unrest underscores the social strains of a Chinese export- manufacturing model where thousands of workers, mostly young, work long hours in military-style conditions, sleeping in dormitories and surrounded by security guards. “The guards here use gangster style to manage,” Fang Zhongyang, 23, said outside campus gates. “We are not against following rules but you have to tell us why. They won’t explain things and we feel like we cannot communicate with them.” Fang, from nearby Henan province , has worked at Foxconn for two years. He started in Shenzhen, the company’s biggest facility, making Apple iPhones and moved to Taiyuan four months ago after being told that Foxconn wasn’t going to make those products there anymore. ‘Fierce’ Guards One guard, a young woman, yelled at a reporter for interviewing workers near the southern gate and told employees to get back inside. She ordered the reporter to go across the street, saying the space outside the gate was Foxconn property. “They are quite formidable,” said Gao Bo, 25, who has worked there for six months. “They watch quite closely and speak fiercely.” As he spoke, platoons in green uniforms kept formation inside the campus. Louis Woo, a spokesman for the Taipei-based company, said he was unaware of the accusations against the guards. “If there’s any truth to these allegations, we’ll take severe action against any security guards, even though we don’t hire them directly,” Woo said by phone yesterday. Foxconn isn’t hiring more security, yet it has asked government officials to help monitor the situation. Woo declined to say what products were made at the Taiyuan factory. The employees interviewed said they made small components. Poorly Trained Gou agreed with a management decision to shut production for a day after the Sept. 23 fight, the company said. Foxconn said it expected limited impact on production. Workers said the fight started in a dormitory and escalated when guards employed by independent contractors responded with excessive force. Such tension is typical in China, said Geoffrey Crothall , a director at rights group China Labor Bulletin. “Factory workers anywhere, beyond Foxconn, never have a good word to say about security guards,” Crothall said yesterday. “Their training is minimal, they’re recruited en masse and the requirements are not much.” Woo declined to comment on the level of training for the guards. Foxconn employs more than 1.2 million workers in at least 18 countries, including China, Brazil , Taiwan , Vietnam and Mexico. It is the primary supplier of Apple’s iPad and iPhone, Sony Corp. (6758) ’s PlayStation game console and TVs, and Nintendo Co.’s Wii console. Bad Food, Dirty Bathrooms The average worker at the Taiyuan plant is 20 years old, with 65 percent being male and 77 percent coming from local Shanxi province, according to a company official, who declined to be identified because of the police investigation. That’s three years younger than the average worker at Foxconn’s Shenzhen factories producing Apple products, according to a March report from the Fair Labor Association, which audited the company’s working conditions. Foxconn in August raised salaries by more than 16 percent at a Zhengzhou factory making iPhones and halved the probation period for new workers after the FLA said the company was ahead of schedule in improving conditions. Work hours exceeded targets and legal mandates, the FLA said. Taiyuan workers start at a monthly salary of 1,800 yuan ($286) and can get a 200-yuan raise after three months. They also get bonuses during Chinese New Year, after six months on the job and after a year. Employees can work as much as 36 hours of overtime a month, the company official said yesterday. Employees outside the factory said the pay was good, though their living conditions were not. The food was of low quality, dorm rooms had four bunk beds for eight people, and the shared bathrooms weren’t clean. “The dormitories are too crowded,” said a 24-year-old worker identifying himself as Wang. “I don’t sleep well because it’s noisy.

Foxconn’s complex, home to 79,000 workers in Taiyuan, Shanxi province, still shows damage caused by a Sept. 23 clash in which a dormitory fight escalated into a riot finally quelled by hundreds of security guards and police. More than 40 people were hospitalized in the melee that left shattered windows and damaged parked cars across the campus. Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou has moved to improve conditions at his factories in recent years, after a spate of suicides and pressure from the company’s largest customer, Apple Inc. (AAPL) The unrest underscores the social strains of a Chinese export- manufacturing model where thousands of workers, mostly young, work long hours in military-style conditions, sleeping in dormitories and surrounded by security guards. “The guards here use gangster style to manage,” Fang Zhongyang, 23, said outside campus gates. “We are not against following rules but you have to tell us why. They won’t explain things and we feel like we cannot communicate with them.” Fang, from nearby Henan province , has worked at Foxconn for two years. He started in Shenzhen, the company’s biggest facility, making Apple iPhones and moved to Taiyuan four months ago after being told that Foxconn wasn’t going to make those products there anymore. ‘Fierce’ Guards One guard, a young woman, yelled at a reporter for interviewing workers near the southern gate and told employees to get back inside. She ordered the reporter to go across the street, saying the space outside the gate was Foxconn property. “They are quite formidable,” said Gao Bo, 25, who has worked there for six months. “They watch quite closely and speak fiercely.” As he spoke, platoons in green uniforms kept formation inside the campus. Louis Woo, a spokesman for the Taipei-based company, said he was unaware of the accusations against the guards. “If there’s any truth to these allegations, we’ll take severe action against any security guards, even though we don’t hire them directly,” Woo said by phone yesterday. Foxconn isn’t hiring more security, yet it has asked government officials to help monitor the situation. Woo declined to say what products were made at the Taiyuan factory. The employees interviewed said they made small components. Poorly Trained Gou agreed with a management decision to shut production for a day after the Sept. 23 fight, the company said. Foxconn said it expected limited impact on production. Workers said the fight started in a dormitory and escalated when guards employed by independent contractors responded with excessive force. Such tension is typical in China, said Geoffrey Crothall , a director at rights group China Labor Bulletin. “Factory workers anywhere, beyond Foxconn, never have a good word to say about security guards,” Crothall said yesterday. “Their training is minimal, they’re recruited en masse and the requirements are not much.” Woo declined to comment on the level of training for the guards. Foxconn employs more than 1.2 million workers in at least 18 countries, including China, Brazil , Taiwan , Vietnam and Mexico. It is the primary supplier of Apple’s iPad and iPhone, Sony Corp. (6758) ’s PlayStation game console and TVs, and Nintendo Co.’s Wii console. Bad Food, Dirty Bathrooms The average worker at the Taiyuan plant is 20 years old, with 65 percent being male and 77 percent coming from local Shanxi province, according to a company official, who declined to be identified because of the police investigation. That’s three years younger than the average worker at Foxconn’s Shenzhen factories producing Apple products, according to a March report from the Fair Labor Association, which audited the company’s working conditions. Foxconn in August raised salaries by more than 16 percent at a Zhengzhou factory making iPhones and halved the probation period for new workers after the FLA said the company was ahead of schedule in improving conditions. Work hours exceeded targets and legal mandates, the FLA said. Taiyuan workers start at a monthly salary of 1,800 yuan ($286) and can get a 200-yuan raise after three months. They also get bonuses during Chinese New Year, after six months on the job and after a year. Employees can work as much as 36 hours of overtime a month, the company official said yesterday. Employees outside the factory said the pay was good, though their living conditions were not. The food was of low quality, dorm rooms had four bunk beds for eight people, and the shared bathrooms weren’t clean. “The dormitories are too crowded,” said a 24-year-old worker identifying himself as Wang. “I don’t sleep well because it’s noisy. The environment isn’t good.” --Alexandra Ho, Tim Culpan. Editors: Michael Tighe , Bret Okeson.

Nikkei 225 Posts Best Back-to-Back Quarters Since 1972,['Anna Kitanaka' 'Yoshiaki Nohara'],2013-03-29 08:32:57,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-29/topix-index-advances-heads-for-best-quarter-since-1988.html,"Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) gained, capping its best back-to-back quarterly performance since 1972, when “The Godfather” hit the screens and Atari Inc. introduced its “Pong” video game. The Nikkei 225 rose 0.5 percent to 12,397.91 in Tokyo today on optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and policy makers will stimulate the economy. The measure added 19 percent this quarter, extending the 17 percent gain in the previous three months. That’s the best two-quarter advance since the period ended December 1972, when the measure rose 37 percent. The broader Topix Index (TPX) fell 0.2 percent to 1,034.71 today. “It was like we had a big pile of dry hay, and Abe came in and lit up a bonfire,” said Ichiro Takamatsu, who helps manage 150 billion yen ($1.6 billion) at Tokyo-based Bayview Asset Management Co. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will helm his first central bank meeting next week. The former Asian Development Bank president pledged yesterday to continue easing until a 2 percent inflation target is reached, in a sign he wants the central bank to strengthen its commitment to ending deflation. In the last six months of 1972, the Nikkei 225 surged 37 percent to close at 5,207.94. That was the year “The Godfather,” starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino , was released and went on to win three Oscars. Atari started selling millions of its game consoles featuring “Pong,” and Japan hosted the Winter Olympic Games in Sapporo. “The economic and stock market environment in 1972 and now are very similar,” said Kenichi Hirano , a general manager and technical analyst at Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Stocks have been rising for eight straight months and I think gains are going to continue.” Abe’s Change Japanese stocks have rallied since Nov. 14, when elections were announced that brought Abe to power on a platform of increased stimulus and central bank easing. Stocks on the Topix Index trade at 21.37 times estimated earnings now, compared with 19.21 in December 1972, according to data from Daiwa Institute of Research Holdings Ltd. Book value is 1.21 now, compared with 2.88 in 1972, the data show. The new government unveiled a 10.3 trillion yen spending plan in January, and Abe convinced the Bank of Japan (8301) to double its inflation target. Expectations that Abe can force the BOJ to bring forward plans for unlimited asset purchases have helped send the yen plunging 17 percent against the dollar since November, boosting the overseas earnings outlook for the nation’s exporters. The Topix has risen 20 percent this quarter, extending last quarter’s 17 percent gain. That’s the gauge’s best two consecutive quarters since December 2005. Brokerages have posted the biggest advance on the Topix since mid-November, boosted by the recent stocks rally. All the Topix’s 33 industry groups have risen in that period. ‘Major Adjustment’ “Japanese stocks have simply gone through a major adjustment, catching up with overseas stocks as government policy and the yen changed direction,” said Isao Kubo, a Tokyo- based equity strategist at Nissay Asset Management Corp., which oversees about 5 trillion yen ($53 billion). “The adjustment isn’t over yet and stocks may extend gains a bit more as we see new policy content.” In today’s trading, Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co., Japan’s biggest zinc refiner, surged 11 percent, the biggest gain on the Nikkei 225, after its equity rating was raised at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley. Oki Electric Industry Co., which makes communication equipment, jumped 8.3 percent after disclosing plans to cut costs by as much as 3 billion yen a year by eliminating as many as 800 jobs. Solar Tariffs Electricity producers rose today after Japan gave its final approval to cut tariffs on solar power. Tokyo Electric Power Co. jumped 9.9 percent. Kansai Electric Power Co. and Hokkaido Electric Power Co. (9509) climbed at least 3.4 percent. Japan approved a recommendation to cut the tariff on solar power by 10 percent for the fiscal year starting April 1 for 20 years, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. The reduction marks the first rate change since the country started an incentive program for clean energy in July. Among stocks that fell, Panasonic Corp. (6752) , the maker of Viera televisions, tumbled 7.1 percent, the biggest drop on the Nikkei 225, after its president said the company will keep its loss- making plasma TV business. Volume on the Nikkei 225 was 19 percent lower than its 30- day average today. Markets in Hong Kong , Australia , New Zealand , Singapore and India were shut for a holiday. The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index fell 2.9 percent to 25.67 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.4 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.

Consumer Spending in U.S. Climbs by Most in Five Months,['Shobhana Ch' 'ra' 'Jeanna Smialek'],2013-03-29 16:03:58,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-29/consumer-spending-in-u-s-increases-by-most-in-five-months.html,"Consumer spending climbed in February by the most in five months and confidence unexpectedly improved in March, showing job-market gains are helping Americans overcome tax increases and concern about federal budget cuts. Purchases, which account for about 70 percent of the economy, rose 0.7 percent after a 0.4 percent advance the prior month that was bigger than previously estimated, according to Commerce Department data today in Washington. Another report showed consumer sentiment advanced to a four-month high. Record stock prices and rising home values combined with gains in wages are helping households repair finances left in shreds by the recession, making it easier to cope with a two percentage-point increase in the payroll tax. The pickup in spending at retailers including Macy’s Inc. (M) is giving the world’s largest economy a boost just as efforts to narrow the budget deficit prompt government cutbacks. “The economy is in a very good place right now ahead of the fiscal restraint,” said Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York. “There are no signs in the data that the expiration of the payroll-tax cut is affecting consumers whatsoever. This recovery is sustainable.” Stock markets in the U.S. were closed today for the Good Friday holiday. Consumer confidence climbed this month as Americans grew more optimistic about the outlook for the economy. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s final March sentiment index rose to 78.6, exceeding all estimates in a Bloomberg survey, from 77.6 in February. Record Revision The 6.8-point revision from a preliminary March reading of 71.8, released two weeks ago, was the largest on record, according to economists at JPMorgan Chase and Co. and Barclays Plc in New York. Economists projected a final reading of 72.6, according to the Bloomberg survey median. “Consumers discounted the administration’s warning about economic catastrophe following the cuts in federal spending, and consumers have renewed their expectations that job gains will accelerate in the months ahead,” Richard Curtin , the sentiment survey’s chief economist, said in a statement. The gauge of expectations six months from now, which more closely projects the direction of consumer spending, also advanced to a four-month high. The group’s index of current conditions, which measures whether Americans think it’s a good time to make big investments and gauges consumers’ views of their personal finances, matched November as the strongest reading since January 2008. Last month’s increase in consumer spending beat the median forecast of a 0.6 percent rise in a Bloomberg survey of 78 economists. Department Stores Some merchants are projecting the pace of sales will be sustained. Macy’s, the second-largest U.S. department-store chain, said sales at stores open at least a year will rise 3.5 percent this year, after growing 3.7 percent in 2012. “We think the customer is OK, not particularly strong, not particularly weak,” Karen Hoguet , chief financial officer at Cincinnati, Ohio-based Macy’s, said at a March 14 conference. “We look at the momentum we have coming into the year and we feel quite confident.” At the same time, “that doesn’t mean that we’re not cognizant of all that’s going on in Washington and what’s gone on with the payroll tax,” she said. Figures today from the Labor Department showed payrolls climbed in 42 states in February, while the jobless rate dropped in 22. Texas led with an 80,600 hiring increase, the biggest in data going back to 1982, followed by California with 41,200. Rhode Island , Vermont , California and New Jersey showed the biggest declines in unemployment rates. Personal Income The Commerce Department’s report showed incomes increased 1.1 percent, exceeding the 0.8 percent advance projected by economists surveyed. The gain in February followed a 3.7 percent drop the prior month that reflected, in part, the higher payroll tax rate. The saving rate increased to 2.6 percent from 2.2 percent in January, which was the lowest since August 2007. Wages and salaries climbed 0.6 percent after falling 0.6 percent. Figures for both months were reduced by $15 billion at an annual rate, reflecting the impact of the accelerated bonuses paid out last year before tax rates climbed. Disposable income , or the money left over after taxes, rose 0.7 percent after adjusting for inflation. It dropped 4 percent in the prior month. Adjusting consumer spending for inflation, which renders the figures used to calculate gross domestic product, purchases rose 0.3 percent for a second month, today’s report showed. An index of prices tied to spending patterns increased 1.3 percent from February 2012, the same as in January. The gain is below the Federal Reserve ’s goal of keeping inflation around 2 percent, leaving policy makers room to keep pumping money into financial markets to spur growth and reduce unemployment. Core Inflation The so-called core measure, which excludes food and fuel costs, rose 0.1 percent from the prior month, and was also up 1.3 percent from February 2012. The economy grew at a 0.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, following a 3.1 percent gain in the previous three months, revised figures showed yesterday. The fourth-quarter slowdown was due to the biggest slump in military spending since 1972 and slower inventory building. Consumer purchases rose at a 1.8 percent rate, revised down from a prior estimate of 2.1 percent. Economic growth will move up to a 2 percent rate in the first quarter, according to the median estimate of 73 economists surveyed by Bloomberg from March 8 to March 13. Incomes are being buoyed by payroll growth. Employers added a net 236,000 workers in February after a 119,000 increase the prior month. Average hourly earnings climbed 2.1 percent from February 2012, matching the year-over-year gains in the previous two months as the strongest since March 2012. Retail Sales Williams-Sonoma Inc. (WSM) is among retailers enjoying a pickup in sales. Same-store purchases at the San Francisco-based company’s West Elm home-goods chain increased 19 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, while sales at Pottery Barn Kids advanced 7.7 percent. Spending on big-ticket items like automobiles is also growing as households replace older vehicles and take advantage of low borrowing costs. Cars and light trucks sold at a 15.3 million annual rate in February after a 15.2 million pace the prior month, Ward’s Automotive Group data showed. Rising stock prices and a recovering housing market are helping boost household finances. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index closed at a record high of 1,569.19 yesterday. The S&P/Case-Shiller of property values in 20 U.S. cities jumped 8.1 percent in the 12 months to January, the biggest year-to-year gain since June 2006.

(7267) in October 2011, two months after Consumer Reports ridiculed the onetime favorite Civic as a substandard car, when President Takanobu Ito saw drawings of the next Fit. He ripped up the plans and summoned his top two designers. “The design had no character and looked very much like its predecessor,” said Yoshinori Asahi, who co-designed Honda’s top-of-the line NSX supercar. “That made us worried about the future of the car.” Almost two years later, Tokyo-based Honda is unveiling the overhauled Fit today with a stretched front grille, tapered headlights and indented doors. Ito has said much is riding on the Fit, singling out the car as a driver of Honda’s global growth until at least 2015, especially in emerging markets , as motorists increasingly shift toward smaller automobiles. “The new Fit will be very important for the carmaker,” said Koichi Sugimoto, a Tokyo-based auto analyst at BNP Paribas SA. “It will also be important for Honda in changing the perception among investors that the carmaker is solely dependent on sales from North America.” Though the Fit, called Jazz in markets such as China and U.K., is the smallest-sized car in Honda’s global product portfolio, it’s also the company’s best-seller in Japan and ranks fourth worldwide after the Civic, CR-V and Accord. Fuel Economy The Fit goes on sale in Japan in September and the gasoline-electric version will run 36.4 kilometers a liter under Japanese standards, according to the carmaker. That’s better mileage than Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s most fuel efficient hybrid, the Prius c, which gets 35.4 kilometers per liter. Honda said the new hybrid Fit will probably be priced higher than the previous version, which starts at 1.59 million yen ($15,855), or 100,000 yen cheaper than the Prius c. The next Fit will reach U.S. dealerships in the spring of 2014, said Makoto Konishi, chief engineer of the new vehicle. Besides fuel economy, Ito, 59, is betting that traditional buyers of small cars -- singles, young families and retirees -- will embrace the new look. The slimmer headlights give the previous bug-eyed Fit more of a scowl, the rear lights have been stretched and the indented sides are meant to create the illusion of perpetual motion, according to Toshinobu Minami, global creative director at Honda, Japan ’s third-largest carmaker. Civic Debacle As differences between brands narrow in terms of fuel economy and other specifications, carmakers are under mounting pressure to sharpen their designs, said Yoshiaki Kawano, a Tokyo-based analyst at industry researcher IHS Automotive said. Designs were in focus in 2011, when the then-new Civic compact flopped in tests by Consumer Reports and failed to receive the magazine’s “Recommended” rating. The redesigned car was less agile, had poorer interior quality, offered a choppier ride and was noisier than the last Civic, the magazine said at the time. Honda, in the quickest turnaround of a car in the company’s history, rolled out a new version of the Civic in about 19 months and regained the “Recommended” status from Consumer Reports. The Civic debacle rippled through other vehicles. “The first thing that President Ito ordered us to do was to build a car that’s cool,” said Minami.

The recommendations come less than two weeks after the nation’s biggest automobile association voiced concerns that the government is preparing to widen the number of cities curbing auto purchases. Such restrictions could undermine economic growth and the ability for local brands to compete, according to the government-backed car group. Car sales should be restricted to people having legitimate parking space and motorists should be charged a registration fee when buying a vehicle, according to the Beijing chapter of the CPPCC. Vehicle ownership in the capital will probably climb to about 6 million units by end of 2015. Shi Jianhua, deputy secretary general at China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, said on July 10 that the trade body is opposed to government vehicle restrictions because they undermine consumption, deprive people of the right to own a car and don’t do much to ease traffic jams.

Europe Auto Production Seen Slowing as Inventory Builds,['Thomas Black'],2013-07-19 22:01:13,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/europe-auto-production-seen-slowing-as-inventory-builds.html,"European automakers will probably slow production this quarter to shed inventory that’s building as output exceeds vehicle purchases, Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Chief Financial Officer Dave Anderson said. European registrations of new cars and light trucks are lagging behind production by as much as 2 percentage points since the beginning of the year, leading to an “inevitable correction,” he said in a telephone interview yesterday. “It’s not significantly greater than demand, but we think it’s enough that there will be some correction,” Anderson said. “The correction will most likely occur through the summer plant-down schedules that would be in the third quarter.” European vehicle sales have declined as the region’s economy slumps, unemployment remains high and governments struggle to rein in spending. In June, total new-car registrations fell 6.3 percent from a year earlier to 1.18 million, the lowest for the month since 1996. Honeywell expects sales for its transportation unit, which supplies turbochargers mostly to European automakers, to rise 2 percent to 4 percent this quarter, less than the 5.2 percent increase to $947 million for the second quarter. The second-quarter sales growth was the unit’s first since 2011’s final three months as the decline in European Union vehicle production narrowed to 1 percent.

Canadian Investigators Says Failed Brakes Led to Crash,['Gerrit De Vynck' 'Jim Snyder'],2013-07-20 02:00:20,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/canadian-investigators-says-failed-brakes-led-to-crash.html,"The brakes on the train that crashed and burned in Quebec this month weren’t applied with enough force, Canadian investigators have found. The braking on the Montreal Maine & Atlantic Railway Ltd. train was “insufficient” to hold the 73 cars that were parked on a 1.2 percent downhill slope near Lac-Megantic, Quebec, the Transportation Safety Board said today in a statement. “The train was not completely immobilized,” said Ed McCallum, a spokesman for the Ottawa-based agency. He said he was unable to give the number of brakes that were set on the train. “The number of brakes is important, but the quality is also important,” said McCallum. The board is urging federal regulators at Transport Canada to review all rules governing how trains are secured and to look into operating procedures to make sure trains carrying dangerous goods are not left unsupervised on a main track, McCallum said. The engineer responsible for the train may not have set enough hand brakes to secure it before he left for his hotel that evening, Edward Burkhardt, chief executive officer of Rail World Inc., which owns the railway, said last week. Earlier this week, Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP) and Canadian National Railway Co. (CNR) , the nation’s two biggest railroads, said they would review and strengthen their safety measures as a result of the crash. Testing Crude The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train rolled from its parking spot on July 6 into Lac-Megantic, creating a massive explosion that leveled much of the downtown. It was the worst rail disaster in Canada in more than a century. Quebec police today revised the estimated death toll to 47 from 50, according to Benoit Richard, spokesman for the Surete de Quebec. Regulators are also testing crude from the freight train that crashed in Quebec. The Transportation Safety Board took samples this week, trying to determine what was in the oil as part of its investigation into the fire that followed the crash. “We sampled the products and the goal there is to be sure of the real nature of the product in the tankers and to be able to explain the magnitude of the fire and the extent of the explosion,” McCallum said. The samples, which were taken from multiple tanker cars, will take a few weeks to analyze, McCallum told reporters today in Lac-Megantic. McCallum declined to identify which substances the board is testing for. U.S. Senator Jay Rockefeller today asked the Government Accountability Office, Congress’s investigative arm, to review the impact of increased shale oil and gas development on transportation infrastructure. Production increases have “raised questions about the ability of existing infrastructure to safely transport these hazardous products, and the capacity of safety standards,” Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, said in an e-mailed statement.

Kansas City Southern Sees Gain From Mexico Auto Factories,['Jennifer Surane'],2013-07-19 20:12:49,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/kansas-city-southern-sees-gain-from-mexico-auto-factories.html,"Kansas City Southern (KSU) , the U.S. railroad that gets almost half of its revenue from Mexico, may see as much as “double digit” sales growth in the unit that ships cars as automakers complete factories in the nation. Opening days are “just around the corner,” Patrick Ottensmeyer, executive vice president of sales and marketing, said during a conference call today, after the company reported second-quarter adjusted earnings that topped analysts’ estimates. The company says it expects a sales boost this year and in 2014. Japanese carmakers are building facilities in the Latin American nation, which Kansas City Southern says should boost shipping volume. Auto companies invested about $3.7 billion in Mexico from 2010 and 2012, the Center for Automotive Research said. The Mexican Automobile Industry Association has forecast a 35 percent jump in annual production by 2017. “The trends for Mexico near shoring continue to be positive,” Ottensmeyer said. “We don’t see any changes for that outlook.” Nissan, which builds cars in the U.S., later this year plans to open a $2 billion auto-assembly plant in Aguascalientes, Mexico, the company’s third in that country. Honda plans to build a $470 million transmission factory in the nation at the same site as an auto plant opening in 2014. Kansas City Southern reported profit of 96 cents, compared with an average analyst estimate of 95 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Per-share earnings excluded the impact of debt retirement costs and the weakening of the peso. Mexican Peso The weaker Mexican currency resulted in a 14-cent hedging-related loss during the period, the company said on the call. The peso fell 4.6 percent against the U.S. dollar in the second quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “If the peso stays where it is, or strengthens further in the second half, we could see growth rates in the high-single digits, as opposed to the double digits,” Ottensmeyer said. The company said it has received more than its “fair share” of contracts for shipping cars from Mexican facilities. When the plants begin to roll out vehicles at full capacity, the railroad also aims to win business for auto parts. Kansas City Southern, the fifth-largest railroad in the U.S., has invested $300 million in track upgrades between central Mexico and Houston and railcars that can handle large auto shipments said William Galligan, vice president of investor relations at the Kansas City, Missouri-based company. Automotive revenue accounted for 8 percent of total sales, or $47.5 million during the second quarter, a 20 percent increase from a year earlier. The shares rose 1.2 percent to $118.30 at the close in New York. They have risen 42 percent this year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has added 19 percent.

Kansas City Southern, the fifth-largest railroad in the U.S., has invested $300 million in track upgrades between central Mexico and Houston and railcars that can handle large auto shipments said William Galligan, vice president of investor relations at the Kansas City, Missouri-based company. Automotive revenue accounted for 8 percent of total sales, or $47.5 million during the second quarter, a 20 percent increase from a year earlier. The shares rose 1.2 percent to $118.30 at the close in New York. They have risen 42 percent this year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has added 19 percent.

Daihatsu to Consider Cars Cheaper Than Ayla for Emerging Markets,['Masatsugu Horie' 'Ma Jie'],2013-07-19 10:37:58,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/daihatsu-to-consider-cars-cheaper-than-ayla-for-emerging-markets.html,"Daihatsu Motor Co. (7262) is considering cars priced even lower than its Ayla hatchback for emerging markets to fend off competition from automakers targeting first-time buyers in countries such as Indonesia. “We need to be able to make cars even cheaper” than the Ayla, Masanori Mitsui, president of Daihatsu, told reporters in Ikeda, Japan , where the company affiliated to Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) is based. He declined to say how much the Ayla will cost. Daihatsu joins automakers such as Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , which this month revived its Datsun brand after three decades, in targeting first-time buyers in emerging markets. Daihatsu has said the Ayla will be introduced in Indonesia after the government implements a policy to give tax breaks and incentives to manufacturers of small, fuel efficient cars. “The demand for low-cost entry level vehicles will continue to grow as the economy develops,” Mitsui said yesterday. “So the Ayla we are introducing this time won’t be enough.” The Ayla was designed to meet the Indonesian rules that include fuel efficiency of at least 20 kilometers per liter of gasoline and local assembly. Daihatsu will also produce a version of the Ayla for Toyota called the Agya. The new program comes as Indonesia is set to overtake Thailand as Southeast Asia’s biggest car market next year, according to forecasts from industry researcher IHS Automotive. Faster Growth Demand for cars in Indonesia, with a population almost twice Japan’s 127 million, is projected to expand faster than in China over the next seven years as growth in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy accelerates. Low cost green cars could account for more than 35 percent of the 1.8 million passenger vehicles expected to be sold by the end of the decade, according to IHS. Daihatsu and Toyota currently account for about half of the Indonesian market, according to Mitsui. While the Daihatsu Ayla and Toyota Agya are set to be the first to benefit from the program, Nissan’s Datsun will introduce the first car meeting the requirement in Indonesia in the first half next year. Sales in Indonesia accounted for 22 percent of Daihatsu’s revenue in the year ended March, followed by Malaysia with 11 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its home market, Japan, contributed 66 percent, the data shows. Nissan Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn this month unveiled the 1.2-liter five-door Datsun Go in India and the company said it will be priced less than 400,000 rupees ($6,700). Daihatsu will continue to work with Toyota when trying to enter other emerging markets , Mitsui said. Southeast Asian countries besides Indonesia and Malaysia may be the markets they will target next, and there’s also demand in South Africa and Brazil , he said.

U.S. Automakers Thrive as Detroit Goes Bankrupt,['Jeff Green' 'Mark Clothier'],2013-07-19 04:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/u-s-automakers-thrive-as-detroit-goes-bankrupt.html,"The Motor City was the car capital of the world when David Cole graduated from a Detroit high school in 1955 and headed off to college to study auto engineering. Six decades later, the “motor” has mostly moved out, he said. Many of the factories that used to dot the city and employ thousands moved to suburbs, other U.S. states or to China and Brazil as the auto industry became global and manufacturing focused on getting faster and less expensive, said Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor , Michigan , and son of a General Motors Co. (GM) president. “The auto industry was forced to change, driven by industry pressure, and it evolved,” Cole said. “Detroit did not. It’s sad to see. We just took it all for granted.” Detroit, hamstrung by $18 billion in debt, was forced to file the largest bankruptcy for a U.S. municipality yesterday. GM, Ford Motor Co. (F) and Chrysler Group LLC, the automakers that call the region home, are profitable and thriving. “For much of the 20th century, the auto industry and Detroit were synonymous,” said Harley Shaiken , a labor professor at the University of California at Berkeley. “You couldn’t drive through Detroit but be aware of the presence of the automakers.” “The industry has become both global and very much decentralized in the U.S.,” he said. “There’s still a vital presence in Michigan and an important presence within the city, but their fates have diverged.” ‘Much Messier’ It isn’t likely that Detroit’s recovery will be as quick and easy as the turnaround of the U.S. automakers, said Steven Rattner , a New York financier who headed President Barack Obama ’s auto-industry task force in 2009 that ultimately put GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy. GM and Chrysler were scrubbed clean of debt by U.S.-backed bankruptcies that lasted about six weeks. Ford suffered through a painful restructuring on its own that cut debt and labor costs. “This will be much messier than the auto companies,” Rattner said in an interview. “This will go on for a long time.” Detroit’s ties to the fortunes of the auto industry have been fraying for six decades, as manufacturing jobs in the city fell from about 296,000 in 1950 to fewer than 27,000 in 2011. The U.S. automakers, still ruling the road in the ’50s and ’60s, moved much of their manufacturing out of Detroit as they built new factories elsewhere in the U.S. and world. That evacuation of the city accelerated Detroit’s decline. What’s Left Chrysler, majority owned by Fiat SpA (F) , has factories to make Jeeps and Viper sports cars in the city and a 70-person office downtown, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the suburban headquarters where it employs more than 10,000. GM builds the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt at a factory in Detroit, where it also has its headquarters downtown. Ford, based in neighboring Dearborn, built Model Ts in Detroit until 1910 and hasn’t built cars in the city since. The automakers each said yesterday that they will continue to play a role in the city as it restructures. “Chrysler Group believes in the city of Detroit and its people,” the company said in an e-mailed statement. “We not only continue to invest in the city and its residents by adding to our presence in Detroit, we also are committed to playing a positive role in its revitalization.” For GM, the filing may mark a “clean start” for the city. “A healthy auto industry will play a part in Detroit’s comeback story and GM is doing its part,” the company said in a statement. Shares Surge The automakers can afford to be magnanimous. Ford, the oldest U.S. automaker, founded 110 years ago, reached a 29-month high on July 15 and its shares surged 31 percent this year through yesterday. GM has gained 28 percent so far this year. In contrast, Michigan’s largest city has seen its population decline to just 701,475 in 2012, down from a peak of 1.85 million in 1950, when it was the fourth-largest city in the U.S., according to U.S. Census data. The city listed assets and debt of more than $1 billion in a Chapter 9 petition filed yesterday in court in Detroit. Detroit Emergency Financial Manager Kevyn Orr, who helped with the Chrysler bankruptcy, precipitated the filing after failing to reach cost cutting deals with debtors and city unions. “Detroit has been working its way to a level of insolvency for decades -- decades,” Orr said at a press conference yesterday in Detroit. Detroit’s Spiral “Even the casual observer has had to understand for some period of time now that Detroit” was “simply not on a sustainable footing, continuing to borrow, continuing to defer pension payments, continuing not to pay its bills on time, continuing a deepening insolvency -- $18 billion,” Orr said. Detroit’s decline started in the 1950s with the closing the massive Packard plant, said John Wolkonowicz , an independent auto consultant based in Boston and a former Ford product planner. The crumbling factory hasn’t been torn down and redeveloped. It’s an image of Detroit’s decay. The city and the automakers got complacent, Wolkonowicz said. Until the U.S. government forced GM and Chrysler to change during the 2009 bankruptcies, they seemed destined for the same fate, he said. “The Detroit mentality contributed to the decline of the auto industry,” Wolkonowicz said. “I worked in Detroit for a long time. I ran into so many people who worked for the car companies who could care less about the car companies or the industry. They were there because that’s the industry that was there.” Now, with the automakers doing well financially, “there is this disconnect,” Shaiken said. “An industrial revitalization within the city would be very positive, but that reaches beyond what the automakers can do.” To contact the reporters on this story: Jeff Green in Southfield, Michigan at  jgreen16@bloomberg.net ; Mark Clothier in Southfield, Michigan at  mclothier@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jamie Butters at  jbutters@bloomberg.net",['Jeff GreenMark Clothier'],"U.S. Automakers Thrive as Detroit Goes Bankrupt The Motor City was the car capital of the world when David Cole graduated from a Detroit high school in 1955 and headed off to college to study auto engineering.

You can see the complete beat sheet, with page numbers and a summary of each beat, in a sidebar here ."" Yes, Hollywood hacks have been talking about formula pieces forever: George Lucas has said that ""Star Wars"" is basically Joseph Campbell’s Hero’s Journey -- a structure that Campbell himself distilled from several thousand years worth of stories. The elements of a great story are predictable -- someone we like, or at least sympathize with, should have some sort of problem that needs solving. The difference is the slavish adherence to page numbers and reductive formulations that can easily be explained and recognized ... unfortunately, by the audience as well as the producers who buy these films. This formulaic approach has combined with another incredibly annoying trend, at least for anyone who isn’t an adolescent male: the dependence of studios on blockbuster movie franchises aimed at the most reliable segment of moviegoers: guys between the ages of 14 and 25. The thinking seems to be that they pick the movie, because women will go to see ""Independence Day"" with their boyfriend, but guys won’t let their girlfriends drag them to ""Terms of Endearment."" And after 25, they start having kids and are more likely to pop a DVD in than hire a babysitter. So pretty much every big-budget film is aimed at young men. As I say, I don’t begrudge them their blockbusters; I like explosions too. But collectively, their tastes are ... limited. Who wants to see a woman with a personality, and a life outside the film’s hero? Not them! Who wants to see a female hero? Definitely not them! Who wants to explore anything at all other than the challenges of being a maverick who is phenomenally attractive to hot ladies, and also pursued by malign forces that would like to explode him, pronto? Dude, c’mon. In recent times, this has gotten even worse, because Hollywood is no longer focused on American guys; now it also wants to attract all the international guys, too. Thus when they remade ""Red Dawn,"" they had the U.S. invaded by ... North Korea, a tiny country with no navy to speak of ... and also, no international box office for Hollywood. Again, I’m not sad that Hollywood is after international box office; it’s a small world, after all. The problem is that maximizing global distribution means stripping out anything that doesn’t translate ... like, verbal subtlety, or culture-specific issues. All humor must be slapstick. All plots must be ... the hero’s journey. I watch movies from decades past, like ""Chariots of Fire"" or the ""Killing Fields"" or ""Sophie’s Choice,"" and I’m struck that few of them could ever be made now; they’re both too slow, and too subtle. (Note: none of these movies is particularly subtle.) For that matter, as the Official Blog Spouse points out, ""Jurassic Park"" might not get made now; there’s almost no action in the first hour, and it definitely doesn’t conform to Blake Snyder’s formula. Steven Spielberg recently told a film school class that ""Lincoln"" was “this close” to premiering on HBO. If Steven Spielberg can’t get a movie made because he’s insufficiently formulaic, Hollywood has an enormous problem. And Hollywood’s problem is our problem. I want to want to go see movies again.

This formulaic approach has combined with another incredibly annoying trend, at least for anyone who isn’t an adolescent male: the dependence of studios on blockbuster movie franchises aimed at the most reliable segment of moviegoers: guys between the ages of 14 and 25. The thinking seems to be that they pick the movie, because women will go to see ""Independence Day"" with their boyfriend, but guys won’t let their girlfriends drag them to ""Terms of Endearment."" And after 25, they start having kids and are more likely to pop a DVD in than hire a babysitter. So pretty much every big-budget film is aimed at young men. As I say, I don’t begrudge them their blockbusters; I like explosions too. But collectively, their tastes are ... limited. Who wants to see a woman with a personality, and a life outside the film’s hero? Not them! Who wants to see a female hero? Definitely not them! Who wants to explore anything at all other than the challenges of being a maverick who is phenomenally attractive to hot ladies, and also pursued by malign forces that would like to explode him, pronto? Dude, c’mon. In recent times, this has gotten even worse, because Hollywood is no longer focused on American guys; now it also wants to attract all the international guys, too. Thus when they remade ""Red Dawn,"" they had the U.S. invaded by ... North Korea, a tiny country with no navy to speak of ... and also, no international box office for Hollywood. Again, I’m not sad that Hollywood is after international box office; it’s a small world, after all. The problem is that maximizing global distribution means stripping out anything that doesn’t translate ... like, verbal subtlety, or culture-specific issues. All humor must be slapstick. All plots must be ... the hero’s journey. I watch movies from decades past, like ""Chariots of Fire"" or the ""Killing Fields"" or ""Sophie’s Choice,"" and I’m struck that few of them could ever be made now; they’re both too slow, and too subtle. (Note: none of these movies is particularly subtle.) For that matter, as the Official Blog Spouse points out, ""Jurassic Park"" might not get made now; there’s almost no action in the first hour, and it definitely doesn’t conform to Blake Snyder’s formula. Steven Spielberg recently told a film school class that ""Lincoln"" was “this close” to premiering on HBO. If Steven Spielberg can’t get a movie made because he’s insufficiently formulaic, Hollywood has an enormous problem. And Hollywood’s problem is our problem. I want to want to go see movies again. Unfortunately, Hollywood doesn’t seem particularly to want me in the theater.",5489,934,-1
Can Fox and Whitlock Take the Shouting Out of Sports TV?,['Jonathan Mahler'],2013-07-19 16:37:56,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/can-fox-and-whitlock-take-the-shouting-out-of-sports-tv-.html,"Last week, a radical experiment took place in the world of sports programming: Fox tested a show for its new sports network that was not built around two guys arguing with each other in staged debate. The show, tentatively called “Red, White and Truth,” is to be hosted by Fox Sports columnist Jason Whitlock. It was ordered up by none other than Fox News president Roger Ailes. He was apparently inspired by this interview, which was itself occasioned by Bob Costas reading an excerpt from a Whitlock column on Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher, who had just committed a murder-suicide, and gun control during a Sunday Night Football game. Whitlock told me that the show would be a combination of interviews and panel discussions -- “a mishmash of Jon Stewart and Bill Maher,” as he described it. “I think there’s an opportunity to pump the brakes and be provocative without it being a shouting match.” Whitlock’s many strongly held opinions include a high one of himself: Earlier this year, he wrote a column bemoaning the fact that as an online columnist he’s ineligible for a Pulitzer Prize. He is also better known for lead-footing the gas than for pumping the brakes. (This over-the-top interview , in which he compared ESPN.com’s treatment of him to that of Kunta Kinte, cost him his job on the network.) Which makes you wonder if Whitlock is the right man to carry out his own vision. But before we dismiss this whole project entirely, let’s take a closer look. It’s hard to reduce the subjects discussed during the show’s test run to a sentence or two, which is sort of the point. Here’s an excerpt from the e-mail that went out to the panel participants: ""The tearing down of Jason Collins is now underway. His ex-fiancee criticized him in a magazine interview, questioning his priorities. She says Collins has yet to meet with her privately and discuss his sexuality and explain why he lived a lie with her for eight years. Her criticism is certainly justified. However, should we in the media expect to find a perfect man when we examine Jason Collins and his motives for announcing his homosexuality in Sports Illustrated X months ago? Many in the media have already suggested Collins came out of the closet as a means to play in the NBA for one more year. Are Collins' motives and character relevant?"" The basic idea is simple: Replace pointless, contrived arguments over insignificant issues with genuine, original thoughts and conversations about subjects that actually matter. A worthy cause! But is it even remotely possible? After all, it’s not as though we have arrived here by accident. Live events may drive sports-network revenues, but no matter how many rights your network holds, you’re still left with a lot of airtime to fill. Is there an easier, cheaper way to do it than to pre-program a couple of sports guys for outrage and then just flip the switch? Sports is the 24-hour news cycle’s ideal co-conspirator; there’s always something going on. And if it’s worth reporting on, it’s worth arguing about. “You can get TV magic when you can find a duo who find a way to make one plus one equal three,” said Jamie Horowitz, a producer at ESPN. “That’s a forever challenge, but when you get it right you get a PTI or you get a First Take.” Of course, one sports fan’s TV magic is another’s TV nightmare. First Take is the debate show taken to its logical, debased extreme. It’s the Jerry Springer Show of sports, only instead of pitting guest against guest, Skip Bayless does the wet work himself, trying to bait athletes into insulting other athletes or shouting at his hopped-up co-host, Stephen A. Smith. Is it too optimistic to think that Whitlock might be on to something? Maybe we’re all getting sick of the manufactured outrage, the mindless debates. “When you think about it, the fact that a bunch of middle-aged men -- and we’re talking mostly about middle-aged men -- can work themselves into a state of high dudgeon over a dozen or more sports topics each day is really kind of silly,” Costas told me. ESPN knows this. They want the ratings bonanza provided by shows like First Take, but they’d rather have their brand defined by more thoughtful commentators. That’s why they just ate a big pile of crow to bring back Keith Olbermann, who has basically done everything short of keying executives’ cars in the parking lot of ESPN headquarters. (The re-hiring of Olbermann underscores another reality of the sports-show-entertainment complex: There just isn't enough talent to fill the hours.) Is the race to the bottom finally coming to an end? The fact that Fox Sports 1 seems to be positioning itself as a less brainy alternative to ESPN --“ Jockularity ,” is the unfortunate catch phrase coined by the network’s CEO -- isn't exactly heartening. In the absence of encouraging signs, all we have is the increasingly inescapable reality that it’s time for a better sports show, one that doesn't assault our senses and insult our intelligence. Wouldn't it be funny if we got a show matching that description, and we had Roger Ailes to thank for it? (Jonathan Mahler is a Bloomberg View columnist.

Ford Plans First Lincoln Super Bowl Ad to Revive Brand,['Keith Naughton'],2012-12-03 21:15:40,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-03/ford-plans-first-lincoln-super-bowl-ad-to-revive-brand.html,"Ford Motor Co. (F) , seeking to revive sales of Lincoln vehicles, is fielding the brand’s first Super Bowl spot as well as a television commercial that portrays the U.S. president who gave the luxury line its name. The 60-second TV ad, which debuts today, opens with an actor playing Abraham Lincoln emerging from mist. It also shows vintage models and images of Dean Martin and Clark Gable, who owned Lincoln cars, set against fenders of the new MKZ sedan. The nod to the luxury line’s 90-year heritage is part of Ford’s $1 billion bet that it can stem a 63 percent slide in Lincoln sales since their peak in 1990. Ford Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally plans to appear at Lincoln Center in New York today to introduce the “Lincoln Motor Company,” a marketing term meant to create distance between the brand’s vehicles and mainstream Ford models built in the same factories. “It’s our largest campaign ever from the size, scale and reach of it,” Matt VanDyke, Lincoln’s director of marketing, sales and service, said in a briefing Nov. 30. “Every touch point is being reinvented. Everything we’re doing is different.” Michelle Krebs, a Royal Oak, Michigan-based analyst with researcher Edmunds.com, said “Ford has got to have reasonable expectations with Lincoln. The MKZ is a very fine car, but does it really compete with a BMW 3 Series? It’s not even on the same shopping list.” ‘Daunting Task’ Rebuilding Lincoln is a “daunting task,” according to Mark Fields, who took over as Ford’s chief operating officer Dec. 1 after heading its Americas region for seven years. The brand has fallen behind Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW, Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz, Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Lexus and Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi in the U.S. and globally. A successful luxury brand “is essential for us to be a global and successful enterprise,” Field said in October at the opening of Lincoln’s new design studio in Dearborn, Michigan , where the company is based. He acknowledged Lincoln’s turnaround won’t “happen overnight.” Ford hopes to jump-start Lincoln’s revival with a 60-second ad that will debut on the Super Bowl. Lincoln will solicit consumer script suggestions for the spot on Twitter, VanDyke said. Ford said today that it hired comedian and talk-show host Jimmy Fallon, formerly of “Saturday Night Live,” to help produce the spot from the Twitter responses. “We’re going to put a different twist on it and approach it in a very social way and try to do something that hasn’t been done before,” VanDyke said. ‘Brand Ambassador’ Ford also said it’s hiring former Dallas Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith as “brand ambassador” for Lincoln at the Super Bowl. The average cost of a 60-second commercial on this year’s Super Bowl was $7 million, according to NBC, which broadcast the game and said it drew 111.3 million viewers, the most in U.S. television history. The 2013 game, to be shown by CBS Corp. (CBS) , will be Feb. 3 in New Orleans. The TV ad that starts today with Abraham Lincoln will run on prime-time shows such as “The Voice,” which airs on Comcast Corp.’s NBC network. Ford fell 0.3 percent to $11.41 at the close in New York. The shares have risen 6 percent this year. Lincoln has been known mostly for its black Town Cars that ferry executives to airports. That model was retired this year, and Mulally is seeking younger, wealthier buyers and a bigger slice of more-profitable luxury sales. Lincoln, whose buyers average 65 years old, is introducing seven new models by 2015. Sales Decline Lincoln had U.S. sales of 85,643 vehicles in 2011, down from a 1990 peak of 231,660. Its sales fell 9.1 percent in November and are down 3.2 percent this year to 74,766. The top- selling U.S. luxury auto brand last year was BMW with 247,907. Rather than trying to dislodge BMW and Mercedes owners from their cars, Lincoln is seeking “curious” luxury buyers not beholden to brand names, VanDyke said. Those buyers, who may come from near-luxury brands such as General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Buick or even economy cars like Toyota’s Scion, account for 25 percent of the premium market, he said. “They are open to new ideas,” VanDyke said. “They are not driven to drive a BMW 3 Series because there are four of them on their block. They are the folks who are very willing to find a product that has a unique heritage.” ‘Personal Approach’ Lincoln will make a more detailed appeal to those buyers in newspaper ads today in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and USA Today. Headlined, “Does the world need another luxury car? Not really,” the ads draw on Lincoln’s history as a pet project of Edsel Ford, son of founder Henry, who commissioned the creation of the first Lincoln Continental for himself and then sold copies to his wealthy friends. That “personal approach” to creating luxury cars is how Lincoln “will become great again,” according to the ads. Lincoln dealers previewed the marketing campaign in Las Vegas last month. Terry Massey, general manager at Ken Stoepel Ford-Lincoln in Kerrville, Texas , said he liked the campaign and the new cars. He said he hopes it will turn around his Lincoln sales, which have fallen by half, while worrying that his Lincoln loyalists won’t fit into the new youth appeal. The ad campaign is “great, it touches my emotions, but how many of those people do I have around here,” Massey said in an interview. “And those people can still buy a Mercedes, an Audi, a BMW, a Lexus. Those are still good cars.” To contact the reporter on this story: Keith Naughton in Detroit at knaughton3@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jamie Butters at jbutters@bloomberg.net",['Keith Naughton'],"Ford Plans First Lincoln Super Bowl Ad to Revive Brand Ford Motor Co.

Ex-Met Lenny Dykstra Gets 6 1/2-Month Prison Sentence for Fraud,['Edvard Pettersson'],2012-12-04 06:51:57,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-03/ex-n-y-met-dykstra-gets-six-and-a-half-months-for-fraud-1-.html,"Former New York Mets outfielder Lenny Dykstra received a six and a half-month prison sentence for looting valuables worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from his mansion after he had filed for bankruptcy. Dykstra, 49, was sentenced yesterday by U.S. District Judge Dean D. Pregerson in Los Angeles. The former Major League Baseball player is already serving a three-year California state prison term for grand theft auto and a nine-month term for lewd conduct and assault with a deadly weapon. “I’m trying to understand who is Mr. Dykstra,” Pregerson said. “There’s a spectrum of conduct that’s hard for me to understand.” Dykstra’s federal public defender, Hilary Potashner, told the judge that drug and alcohol abuse were behind Dykstra’s string of criminal conduct in the past few years, including the bankruptcy fraud, his efforts to lease cars with false business information and attempts to have sex with women who responded to an ad for a personal assistant. His drug addiction dated back to his days as a baseball player when, after many injuries, he had to take painkillers to “make it through the day,” Potashner said. His financial difficulties tripped him up in the mid-to-late 2000s, the lawyer told the judge. ‘Different Person’ “He didn’t act like Lenny Dykstra ,” Potashner said. “He was a different person. He was making erratic, Id-driven decisions.” Dykstra had been “beaten to a pulp” in state custody and had his front teeth knocked out because of his celebrity status, the lawyer said. Dykstra, dressed in a white prison jumpsuit, made a short statement apologizing to the government and his family. “I don’t think I’m a bad person,” Dykstra said. “I’m looking forward to a new start.” The judge said he decided to err on the side of a short prison term and ordered Dykstra to perform 500 hours of community service. The former baseball player won’t serve the entire three years of his state prison term and is likely to be released sometime next year. ‘Celebrity Status’ Federal prosecutors had asked the judge to sentence Dykstra to 2 1/2 years in prison, saying he had been “trading on his celebrity status” and acted as if he was above the law. Assistant U.S. Attorney Evan Davis said after the hearing that the sentence is “less than what the government requested.” “It’s the judge’s job to make that decision,” he said. In July, Dykstra pleaded guilty to bankruptcy fraud, concealment of bankruptcy property and money laundering. The government alleged that after he filed for bankruptcy in 2009, he stripped as much as $400,000 in valuables and fixtures from the $18.5 million mansion north of Los Angeles he had bought two years earlier from Hall of Fame hockey player Wayne Gretzky. According to the government’s sentencing recommendation, Dykstra, who had won the World Series with the Mets in 1986, went through a cycle of poor business decisions and substance abuse after his retirement from baseball that eventually left him broke and imprisoned. Finances Deteriorated The Southern California native sold a profitable car wash business in 2007 when he bought the mansion just as the real estate market started its decline, prosecutors said. A plan to turn the mansion in a time-share went nowhere as did Dykstra’s Players Club magazine, prosecutors said. As his finances deteriorated, Dykstra’s substance abuse increased, according to the government. Dykstra drank a liter of vodka a day at times and took prescription painkillers including Percocet, according to the government. When police searched his home in 2011, they found cocaine, Ecstasy and human growth hormone, Los Angeles authorities said at the time. In April, Dykstra pleaded no contest to charges he told women who came to meet him in response to ads he placed on Craigslist for personal assistants and housekeepers that the job also required giving him massages. In one case, Dykstra removed the door handle to trap a woman in his room and began masturbating, suggesting that the job of personal assistant included performing sexual acts on him, according to the government’s sentencing memorandum. Baseball Memorabilia In the federal bankruptcy fraud case, prosecutors said the losses to his creditors were difficult to determine, such as the market value of a used $50,000 stove Dykstra took from his mansion and sold “out of the back of a truck for a few thousand dollars.” They also accused him of illegally selling baseball memorabilia that should have been part of the bankruptcy estate. In his 2009 Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization filing, Dykstra said he had $37.1 million in debts. The case was converted to Chapter 7 liquidation later that year. Dykstra, known as “Nails,” joined the Mets in 1985 and helped the team win the World Series the following year. He played for the Philadelphia Phillies from 1989 to 1996. The outfielder finished second to Barry Bonds in National League Most Valuable Player Award voting in 1993, when the Phillies reached the World Series to face the Toronto Blue Jays. Dykstra had a career batting average of .285, with 81 home runs and 404 runs batted in, according to baseball-reference.com. The case is U.S. v. Dykstra, 11-00415, U.S. District Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles). To contact the reporter on this story: Edvard Pettersson in Los Angeles at  epettersson@bloomberg.net.
