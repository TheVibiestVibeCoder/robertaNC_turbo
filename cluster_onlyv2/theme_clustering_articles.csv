Fans Hold IPhone-Lit Vigils for Steve Jobs,['Dina Bass' 'Douglas Mac Millan' 'Danielle Kucera'],2011-10-06 18:05:41,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/apple-fans-from-cupertino-to-singapore-mourn-passing-of-jobs.html,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) fans worldwide mourned the death of co-founder Steve Jobs , paying tribute to the man who changed the way they listen to music, use their mobile phones and play on their computers. At Apple’s headquarters -- located at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California -- flags flew at half-staff and bagpipes sounded to the tune of “Amazing Grace” as people placed flowers around a white iPad with a picture of Jobs, who died yesterday at 56, after a battle with cancer. Mourners flocked to Apple stores from New York to Hong Kong , while a crowd gathered in San Francisco ’s Mission Dolores Park for an iPhone-lit vigil. “Part of the narrative that made Apple what it is today goes out with Steve Jobs,” said Christopher Smith, 40, a former business development manager in San Francisco who joined the vigil. “I came out to honor the fact that one man with vision, courage and unwavering dedication can still change the world. The way that I communicate and the way that I interact with the world is through things that Steve Jobs has created.” Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates and Sony Corp. (6758) Chairman Howard Stringer were among leaders who expressed admiration for the man who built the world’s most valuable technology company. President Barack Obama and former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair also issued statements of sympathy. Jobs’s Home “Michelle and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Steve Jobs,” Obama said in a statement. “Steve was among the greatest of American innovators -- brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it.” While Apple plans a celebration for staff, it doesn’t intend to hold a public ceremony, a person familiar with the matter said. Teary-eyed mourners left flowers in front of Jobs’s modest home at the corner of Waverly Street and Santa Rita Avenue in Palo Alto , California. Neighborhood children drew hearts with markers and left them on the ground for others to leave messages. Policemen stood watch, barricading the street. “Here’s a guy who’s a billionaire and lives in a regular neighborhood, not behind a gated estate with all the security guards,” said Bruce Gee, a former Apple employee who drove up to the house from his home a couple miles away. “On Halloween, people go trick or treating there like everyone else.” At the San Francisco Apple store near Union Square, Steve Streza, 24, stood holding an iPad displaying Apple’s homepage image of Jobs and the words “Steve Jobs: 1955-2011.” ‘Regular Guy’ “Macs were the reason I got into product development,” said Streza, a developer at readitlater.com who grew up with Mac computers. “If it weren’t for Steve Jobs and Macs, my life would probably be in a completely different place right now.” Steve Somerstein, who says he met Jobs several times since 1986, recalled the time when he bumped into Jobs while apartment hunting in Palo Alto. “He was just a regular guy,” said Somerstein, who was at the Palo Alto store. “I congratulated him on the company and hoped it was going to do well. I didn’t even own an Apple at that point. He was about 10 years younger than me and just a nice kid.” Ron Kent, a food-truck owner who was at the Palo Alto store, likened Jobs to Michelangelo, the renaissance-era artist who painted the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. “He’s the visionary of our time,” Kent said. ‘RIP Steve Jobs’ Some mourned via social media sites. More than 20 “RIP Steve Jobs” pages sprung up on Facebook within hours of the announced passing of Jobs. News of Jobs’s death slowed the mobile websites of CNN and the Washington Post, according to Keynote Systems Inc. (KEYN) , which tracks website performance. “Steve Jobs,” the biography written by former Time magazine editor Walter Isaacson, scheduled for release Nov. 21, was the best seller on Amazon.com Inc.’s website. In New York, Jared and Alexi Roth, 33 and 31, left two red apples by the wall outside the Apple store on Broadway in the Upper West Side. “We were literally walking by a market on Broadway when Jared got a text saying Steve Jobs died,” Alexi said. “We saw the apples and just thought it would be appropriate.” Across the ocean, Charanis Chiu, walked in front of the Apple store in Hong Kong to place a sunflower, the logo of the photo-viewing application on the iPhone. “A lot of companies such as Microsoft and Nokia are following in his direction,” said Chiu, a vendor of photographic equipment. “Apple will continue to grow as long as they are going in the right direction.” ‘Insanely Great Honor’ At the store in Shanghai ’s Lujiazui district, an area of about three square meters was set aside at the front for people to pay tribute to Jobs. Microsoft’s Gates praised the man who for decades was both a rival and a partner in the personal-computer industry. “The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come,” Gates said. “For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it’s been an insanely great honor. I will miss Steve immensely.” Stephen Elop, chief executive officer of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , said the world lost a “true visionary” in Jobs’s passing. Sachio Kitagawa, 45, was on her way with her son to the Apple store in the Ginza shopping district of Tokyo when she heard the news of Jobs’s passing. “He should receive the Nobel prize,” said Kitagawa, who’s used Apple products for 20 years. “I have a second child who is disabled and even he can use the Macintosh. It shows you how user-friendly Apple products are.” ‘Thank You’ Outside the Apple store a short walk from Frankfurt ’s financial institutions, sunflowers, gerbera daisies and roses were laid alongside a burning candle. “He forged designs which appealed to the mass market and developed technology which you can now find in museums -- not because of its age, but because it was groundbreaking,” said Guenther Uttecht, a 60-year-old artist who uses Apple products to work on abstract photos as he left the shop. At the entrance of the store on Regents Street in London lay a white rose with a hand-written note saying “Rip Steve Jobs. With love from Instagramers London and all Instagramers around the world. You gave us life. Thank you x”. Next to it a passerby had left an apple with a bite out of it, imitating the brand’s iconic logo, alongside a bouquet of lillies. On Rue Halevy, just behind Opera Garnier in central Paris, flowers were tucked into the doors of the Apple store. One bouquet had a card from Mario Baluci, the creative artist at Carre Senart, that said, “Thank you, Steve.” In Singapore , Georgina Koh, 30, recalled the man who inspired her to open her own accessory shop. “The world should remember Steve Jobs’s famous quote ‘Stay Hungry, Stay foolish,’” said Koh, a former Apple worker, in reference to Jobs’s Stanford University commencement speech in 2005. “It’s an honor to have been associated with Apple. It is a company built by a man relentless about creating beautiful products that have changed our lives.” To contact the reporters on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at  dbass2@bloomberg.net ; Douglas Macmillan in New York at  dmacmillan3@bloomberg.net ; Danielle Kucera in New York at  dkucera6@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net",['Dina BassDouglas Mac MillanDanielle Kucera'],"Fans Hold IPhone-Lit Vigils for Steve Jobs Apple Inc.

"Dodd-Frank, Cybersecurity, Tax Holiday, Finra: Compliance",['Carla Main'],2011-10-06 12:19:24,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/rule-roadmap-cybersecurity-corporate-tax-holiday-compliance.html,"U.S. regulators should publish a schedule for when all Dodd-Frank Act rules will take effect to smooth a “haphazard implementation process” that is hurting the economy by perpetuating uncertainty, Representative Scott Garrett said in a letter. Garrett, a New Jersey Republican, made the comments in a letter to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner that was released yesterday. A member of the House Financial Services Committee , Garrett said the Financial Stability Oversight Council led by Geithner should publish an implementation schedule by Nov. 15 to address “grave concerns about the lack of direction that U.S. financial regulators have provided thus far.” Geithner is scheduled to testify today before the Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee to discuss the first annual report from FSOC, a 10-member council of regulators created by Dodd-Frank, the financial-rules overhaul enacted last year. Compliance Policy House Republicans Cybersecurity Plan Calls for Limited Rules Congress should seek to strengthen computer defenses at U.S. power, water and telecommunications companies with voluntary standards and limited regulation, according to a House Republican task force on cybersecurity. Lawmakers also should authorize an organization outside the government to act as a clearinghouse of information on cyber attacks, to allow U.S. agencies and companies that operate the nation’s critical infrastructure to share real-time data about hacker threats, the task force said in a report released yesterday. The report came on the same day as a hacker threat against the New York Stock Exchange. Anonymous, a group of self-styled hacker-activists behind attacks on corporate and government websites, vowed to support the Occupy Wall Street protests by erasing the New York Stock Exchange “from the Internet” on Oct. 10. The group posted a video message on YouTube declaring war on the world’s largest stock exchange in retaliation for the mass arrests of Wall Street protesters. The two-minute message didn’t elaborate on the threat or whether it referred only to an attack on the NYSE website, which would have no effect on trading. Richard Adamonis , a spokesman for NYSE Euronext (NYX) , which operates the exchange, said the company doesn’t comment on rumors or security matters. For more, click here and click here. Repatriation Tax Holiday to Be Proposed by Hagan, McCain U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said a corporate- profit repatriation proposal by Senators Kay Hagan and John McCain won’t pass the Senate as a stand-alone bill and needs to be coupled with infrastructure improvement efforts. McCain and Hagan said they would introduce the legislation today. New York Senator Charles Schumer , the chamber’s No. 3 Democrat, said in June that Senate Democrats might be open to using the short-term revenue provided by a corporate tax holiday to finance an infrastructure bank. Hagan, a Democrat from North Carolina, and McCain, an Arizona Republican, said yesterday they will sponsor a bill to let U.S. companies bring home as much as $1.4 trillion of overseas profits at a reduced tax rate. Large multinational companies including Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) have been lobbying Congress to let them return overseas profits to the U.S. at a lower rate. The companies say the infusion of cash would boost the economy and lead to increased employment. Corporate profits now are taxed at a top rate of 35 percent. Linking repatriation to infrastructure would address a concern of congressional Democrats that the tax break should promote job creation. Companies advocating repatriation have mounted an intensive lobbying campaign. For more, click here. Finra Backs Bachus on Regulating Advisers, Luparello Says Legislation authorizing one or more self-regulatory organizations to oversee registered investment advisers has been endorsed by an official of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Stephen Luparello, vice chairman of the Finra, described the draft bill circulated by Representative Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican, as “directionally, exactly what we want.” He made the remarks at a Financial Services Institute Inc. conference in Washington yesterday. Much of the costs of assuming oversight of investment advisers as a self regulator are already embedded in Finra’s infrastructure, according to Luparello, who oversees regulatory operations for Finra, which is funded by the brokers it regulates. Congress is considering whether to name a self regulator for registered investment advisers. Richard Ketchum, chairman and chief executive officer of Finra, told a subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee Sept. 13 that his group was “uniquely positioned” to handle the job. Bachus, who leads the full committee, proposed draft legislation last month that would charge one or more self- regulatory groups, under the authority of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with overseeing registered investment advisers. The proposal didn’t specify whether the self regulator should be Finra or another group. For more, click here. House Panel Backs Bill Boosting Nonpublic-Firm Shareholder Limit A U.S. House panel approved measures that would let closely held firms attract more investors without going public as part of a slate of Republican-backed legislation aimed at spurring economic growth. The House Financial Services Capital Markets subcommittee gave bipartisan support yesterday to a bill that would increase to 1,000 from 500 the number of shareholders a nonpublic company can have without an initial public offering. House Republicans are pushing legislation to help startups and smaller firms raise money amid regulatory hurdles and tighter lending standards following the 2008 credit crisis. Shares of such companies are being traded on secondary markets that have emerged since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and last year’s Dodd-Frank Act increased the cost of going public. The panel also approved a measure that would exempt companies with a public float, or shares available to investors, of as much as $350 million from the audit requirement in Sarbanes-Oxley. Companies with less than $75 million are currently exempt from the requirement. Separately, the panel approved by voice vote a bill that would boost the Securities and Exchange Commission threshold to 2,000 for banks. That bill, known as H.R. 1965, would broaden private-bank shareholder limits and require the SEC to undertake a study of private-firm shareholders that would include a cost- benefit analysis of shareholder registration thresholds. Volcker Rule Draft Puts Short-Term Trades Under More Scrutiny U.S. banks seeking to gain from or hedge against short-term price movements in securities and derivatives markets would face restrictions under a proprietary-trading ban, according to a draft of the so-called Volcker rule. The 205-page document, dated Sept. 30 and obtained yesterday by Bloomberg News, is the latest version of the rule to emerge as it’s being written by four federal banking regulators and is scheduled to be released on Oct. 11 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The financial regulators didn’t define short-term in the draft, writing that “it is often difficult to clearly identify the purpose for which a position is acquired or taken and whether that purpose is short-term in nature.” The Volcker rule, which is named for its original champion, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , is intended to reduce the chance that banks will make risky investments with their own capital that put their deposits at risk. The provision was part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul enacted last year, and policy makers are drafting regulations to enforce it. Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have shut or made plans to spin off stand-alone proprietary-trading groups to prepare for the rule. Foreign banks would be covered by the rule if they have U.S.-based staff involved in the restricted trades, according to the draft. For more, click here. Courts Massachusetts Attorney General Says She May Sue Big Banks Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley said she may sue major banks after she “lost confidence” that they will reach an agreement that adequately resolves foreclosure disputes. Attorneys general from all 50 states last year announced they would probe the foreclosure practices of banks following reports of faulty documents being used to seize homes. Since then, a group of attorneys general and federal officials have been negotiating a settlement with the five largest mortgage servicers in the U.S. -- Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. (C) , Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) and Ally Financial Inc. Coakley said in a statement yesterday that she has lost confidence the banks “will bring to the table an agreement that properly holds them accountable for wrongful foreclosures.” Her office has therefore begun preparing for litigation, which would include claims over the filing of false or misleading documents, she said. Coakley didn’t disclose when or which banks would be sued. ‘Lord’ Davenport, Five Others Convicted in Fraud, SFO Says Six men were convicted over a 4 million-pound ($6.2 million) fraud in which a London company charged fees for commercial loans it never provided. Edward Davenport, 45, who described himself as an English Lord while having no official title, was the ringmaster of a “sophisticated criminal enterprise,” the U.K. Serious Fraud Office said in an e-mailed statement. Davenport and Peter Riley, 64, directors of the company Gresham Ltd., were sentenced to seven years in prison last month and banned from acting as company directors for 10 years. Another director, Borge Andersen, was sentenced to three years. David McHugh, Richard Stephens and David Horsfall, who posed as advisers to Gresham, are to be sentenced Nov. 10. Gresham claimed to offer commercial funding or venture capital for construction projects in the U.K., Europe, the U.S., India and the Caribbean. It took millions in “deposits” or “verification” fees, the SFO said. None of the victims received any money. Davenport said he was “shocked and dismayed” at his sentence, according to an e-mailed statement from his lawyer. He has filed an appeal at London’s High Court and wants to clear his name, he said in the statement. Lone Star Found Guilty of Stock Manipulation by Seoul Court Lone Star Funds was found guilty of stock-price manipulation and the former head of its South Korean unit was jailed after a five-year legal dispute that stalled the U.S. buyout fund’s efforts to sell Korea Exchange Bank. (004940)  Paul Yoo was sentenced to three years in prison by Judge Cho Kyung Ran today. Korea Exchange Bank was found not guilty, Cho said after presiding over a retrial ordered by the Supreme Court this year following their acquittal in June 2008. The verdict may remove the final barrier to Lone Star’s sale of Korea Exchange to Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790) , after the litigation delayed its plan to offload the 51 percent stake and derailed two earlier attempts. A public backlash over Lone Star’s legal woes and profit on its eight-year investment may deter foreign takeovers, impeding the government’s plans to sell state assets such as Woori Finance Holdings Co. Lone Star was fined 25 billion won ($21 million) by the court. Korea Exchange Bank spokesman Lee Sun Hwan said the company respects the court’s decision to clear it of the manipulation charge. He declined to comment on the FSC’s remark that it may order Lone Star to sell its stake. Jed Repko, a spokesman for Lone Star in New York, didn’t immediately respond to phone calls or reply to an e-mail sent after regular office hours. For more, click here. Soros Loses Case Against French Insider-Trading Conviction Billionaire investor George Soros lost a challenge to his 2002 insider-trading conviction, with the European Court of Human Rights saying French market regulations were clear enough to hold him responsible. France didn’t violate Soros’s rights in punishing him criminally for trading on inside information about Societe Generale (GLE) SA in spite of the market regulator’s conclusion that its rules were unclear, the Strasbourg, France-based court said. Soros, 81, was convicted in 2002 of insider trading and ordered to repay 2.2 million euros ($2.9 million) he’d made from the share purchase and subsequent sale after a Paris court found he’d acted with the knowledge that the bank might be a takeover target. While prosecutors filed criminal charges, French stock market regulators didn’t pursue Soros, saying insider-trading laws were too vague to determine whether he’d broken them. “It is inconceivable to expect that the citizen has a better understanding of the law than the authority in charge” of market regulation, Ron Soffer, Soros’s lawyer, said. “The opinion of the regulatory authority is an irrebuttable presumption as to the lack of clarity of the law.” Soros will appeal the four-to-three ruling to the court’s Grand Chamber, Soffer said. Interviews/Speeches Czech Government Opposes Financial Transaction Tax, Necas Says The Czech government opposes introduction of a financial transaction tax and issuance of joint euro-area bonds, Prime Minister Petr Necas said. Necas was speaking to reporters yesterday after the weekly Cabinet meeting in Prague. ECB’s Liikanen Says It’s Important to Focus on Systemic Risks European Central Bank Governing Council member Erkki Liikanen said policy makers should learn from past experience and focus on systemic risk. He made the remarks at a conference in Kiel, Germany, yesterday. “This big financial crisis follows the same sequence of events” as previous crises, including high leverage, bursting bubbles, a financial crisis, recession and sovereign debt crises, Liikanen said. “It is extremely important that we never neglect history the way we did a few years ago. If the financial sector grows out of proportion it’s always associated with risks,” Liikanen added. IASB Chief Urges U.S. to Adopt International Accounting Rules U.S. regulators should adopt international accounting rules, known as IFRS, to improve transparency, the chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board said yesterday. Adopting the standards would give U.S. companies “the same financial reporting language for both internal management reporting and external financial reporting on a worldwide consolidated basis,” Hans Hoogervorst, IASB chairman, said in a speech in Boston. Hoogervorst this week criticized U.S. accounting rules that differ from standards set by the IASB during a hearing in the European Parliament. Banks don’t need to show all their derivatives exposure on their balance sheet under U.S. rules, known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, he said. Comings and Goings JPMorgan Derivatives-Risk Assessor Pugachevsky Joins Quantifi JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s Dmitry Pugachevsky, who oversaw analysis of some of the bank’s derivatives risks, joined Quantifi Inc. to run the research division. Pugachevsky was the head of counterparty credit modeling at New York-based JPMorgan. Before that, he was the global head of credit analytics at Bear Stearns Cos. Changes to derivatives regulation in the U.S. and new international capital rules for banks “have brought a heightened focus on counterparty risk and highlight the need for firms to adopt active counterparty risk-management systems,” Pugachevsky said in a statement released by Summit, New Jersey- based Quantifi yesterday.

A member of the House Financial Services Committee , Garrett said the Financial Stability Oversight Council led by Geithner should publish an implementation schedule by Nov. 15 to address “grave concerns about the lack of direction that U.S. financial regulators have provided thus far.” Geithner is scheduled to testify today before the Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee to discuss the first annual report from FSOC, a 10-member council of regulators created by Dodd-Frank, the financial-rules overhaul enacted last year. Compliance Policy House Republicans Cybersecurity Plan Calls for Limited Rules Congress should seek to strengthen computer defenses at U.S. power, water and telecommunications companies with voluntary standards and limited regulation, according to a House Republican task force on cybersecurity. Lawmakers also should authorize an organization outside the government to act as a clearinghouse of information on cyber attacks, to allow U.S. agencies and companies that operate the nation’s critical infrastructure to share real-time data about hacker threats, the task force said in a report released yesterday. The report came on the same day as a hacker threat against the New York Stock Exchange. Anonymous, a group of self-styled hacker-activists behind attacks on corporate and government websites, vowed to support the Occupy Wall Street protests by erasing the New York Stock Exchange “from the Internet” on Oct. 10. The group posted a video message on YouTube declaring war on the world’s largest stock exchange in retaliation for the mass arrests of Wall Street protesters. The two-minute message didn’t elaborate on the threat or whether it referred only to an attack on the NYSE website, which would have no effect on trading. Richard Adamonis , a spokesman for NYSE Euronext (NYX) , which operates the exchange, said the company doesn’t comment on rumors or security matters. For more, click here and click here. Repatriation Tax Holiday to Be Proposed by Hagan, McCain U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said a corporate- profit repatriation proposal by Senators Kay Hagan and John McCain won’t pass the Senate as a stand-alone bill and needs to be coupled with infrastructure improvement efforts. McCain and Hagan said they would introduce the legislation today. New York Senator Charles Schumer , the chamber’s No. 3 Democrat, said in June that Senate Democrats might be open to using the short-term revenue provided by a corporate tax holiday to finance an infrastructure bank. Hagan, a Democrat from North Carolina, and McCain, an Arizona Republican, said yesterday they will sponsor a bill to let U.S. companies bring home as much as $1.4 trillion of overseas profits at a reduced tax rate. Large multinational companies including Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) have been lobbying Congress to let them return overseas profits to the U.S. at a lower rate. The companies say the infusion of cash would boost the economy and lead to increased employment. Corporate profits now are taxed at a top rate of 35 percent. Linking repatriation to infrastructure would address a concern of congressional Democrats that the tax break should promote job creation. Companies advocating repatriation have mounted an intensive lobbying campaign. For more, click here. Finra Backs Bachus on Regulating Advisers, Luparello Says Legislation authorizing one or more self-regulatory organizations to oversee registered investment advisers has been endorsed by an official of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Stephen Luparello, vice chairman of the Finra, described the draft bill circulated by Representative Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican, as “directionally, exactly what we want.” He made the remarks at a Financial Services Institute Inc. conference in Washington yesterday. Much of the costs of assuming oversight of investment advisers as a self regulator are already embedded in Finra’s infrastructure, according to Luparello, who oversees regulatory operations for Finra, which is funded by the brokers it regulates. Congress is considering whether to name a self regulator for registered investment advisers. Richard Ketchum, chairman and chief executive officer of Finra, told a subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee Sept. 13 that his group was “uniquely positioned” to handle the job. Bachus, who leads the full committee, proposed draft legislation last month that would charge one or more self- regulatory groups, under the authority of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with overseeing registered investment advisers. The proposal didn’t specify whether the self regulator should be Finra or another group. For more, click here. House Panel Backs Bill Boosting Nonpublic-Firm Shareholder Limit A U.S. House panel approved measures that would let closely held firms attract more investors without going public as part of a slate of Republican-backed legislation aimed at spurring economic growth. The House Financial Services Capital Markets subcommittee gave bipartisan support yesterday to a bill that would increase to 1,000 from 500 the number of shareholders a nonpublic company can have without an initial public offering. House Republicans are pushing legislation to help startups and smaller firms raise money amid regulatory hurdles and tighter lending standards following the 2008 credit crisis. Shares of such companies are being traded on secondary markets that have emerged since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and last year’s Dodd-Frank Act increased the cost of going public. The panel also approved a measure that would exempt companies with a public float, or shares available to investors, of as much as $350 million from the audit requirement in Sarbanes-Oxley. Companies with less than $75 million are currently exempt from the requirement. Separately, the panel approved by voice vote a bill that would boost the Securities and Exchange Commission threshold to 2,000 for banks. That bill, known as H.R. 1965, would broaden private-bank shareholder limits and require the SEC to undertake a study of private-firm shareholders that would include a cost- benefit analysis of shareholder registration thresholds. Volcker Rule Draft Puts Short-Term Trades Under More Scrutiny U.S. banks seeking to gain from or hedge against short-term price movements in securities and derivatives markets would face restrictions under a proprietary-trading ban, according to a draft of the so-called Volcker rule. The 205-page document, dated Sept. 30 and obtained yesterday by Bloomberg News, is the latest version of the rule to emerge as it’s being written by four federal banking regulators and is scheduled to be released on Oct. 11 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The financial regulators didn’t define short-term in the draft, writing that “it is often difficult to clearly identify the purpose for which a position is acquired or taken and whether that purpose is short-term in nature.” The Volcker rule, which is named for its original champion, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , is intended to reduce the chance that banks will make risky investments with their own capital that put their deposits at risk. The provision was part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul enacted last year, and policy makers are drafting regulations to enforce it. Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have shut or made plans to spin off stand-alone proprietary-trading groups to prepare for the rule. Foreign banks would be covered by the rule if they have U.S.-based staff involved in the restricted trades, according to the draft. For more, click here. Courts Massachusetts Attorney General Says She May Sue Big Banks Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley said she may sue major banks after she “lost confidence” that they will reach an agreement that adequately resolves foreclosure disputes. Attorneys general from all 50 states last year announced they would probe the foreclosure practices of banks following reports of faulty documents being used to seize homes. Since then, a group of attorneys general and federal officials have been negotiating a settlement with the five largest mortgage servicers in the U.S. -- Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. (C) , Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) and Ally Financial Inc. Coakley said in a statement yesterday that she has lost confidence the banks “will bring to the table an agreement that properly holds them accountable for wrongful foreclosures.” Her office has therefore begun preparing for litigation, which would include claims over the filing of false or misleading documents, she said. Coakley didn’t disclose when or which banks would be sued. ‘Lord’ Davenport, Five Others Convicted in Fraud, SFO Says Six men were convicted over a 4 million-pound ($6.2 million) fraud in which a London company charged fees for commercial loans it never provided. Edward Davenport, 45, who described himself as an English Lord while having no official title, was the ringmaster of a “sophisticated criminal enterprise,” the U.K. Serious Fraud Office said in an e-mailed statement. Davenport and Peter Riley, 64, directors of the company Gresham Ltd., were sentenced to seven years in prison last month and banned from acting as company directors for 10 years. Another director, Borge Andersen, was sentenced to three years. David McHugh, Richard Stephens and David Horsfall, who posed as advisers to Gresham, are to be sentenced Nov. 10. Gresham claimed to offer commercial funding or venture capital for construction projects in the U.K., Europe, the U.S., India and the Caribbean. It took millions in “deposits” or “verification” fees, the SFO said. None of the victims received any money. Davenport said he was “shocked and dismayed” at his sentence, according to an e-mailed statement from his lawyer. He has filed an appeal at London’s High Court and wants to clear his name, he said in the statement. Lone Star Found Guilty of Stock Manipulation by Seoul Court Lone Star Funds was found guilty of stock-price manipulation and the former head of its South Korean unit was jailed after a five-year legal dispute that stalled the U.S. buyout fund’s efforts to sell Korea Exchange Bank. (004940)  Paul Yoo was sentenced to three years in prison by Judge Cho Kyung Ran today. Korea Exchange Bank was found not guilty, Cho said after presiding over a retrial ordered by the Supreme Court this year following their acquittal in June 2008. The verdict may remove the final barrier to Lone Star’s sale of Korea Exchange to Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790) , after the litigation delayed its plan to offload the 51 percent stake and derailed two earlier attempts. A public backlash over Lone Star’s legal woes and profit on its eight-year investment may deter foreign takeovers, impeding the government’s plans to sell state assets such as Woori Finance Holdings Co. Lone Star was fined 25 billion won ($21 million) by the court. Korea Exchange Bank spokesman Lee Sun Hwan said the company respects the court’s decision to clear it of the manipulation charge. He declined to comment on the FSC’s remark that it may order Lone Star to sell its stake. Jed Repko, a spokesman for Lone Star in New York, didn’t immediately respond to phone calls or reply to an e-mail sent after regular office hours. For more, click here. Soros Loses Case Against French Insider-Trading Conviction Billionaire investor George Soros lost a challenge to his 2002 insider-trading conviction, with the European Court of Human Rights saying French market regulations were clear enough to hold him responsible. France didn’t violate Soros’s rights in punishing him criminally for trading on inside information about Societe Generale (GLE) SA in spite of the market regulator’s conclusion that its rules were unclear, the Strasbourg, France-based court said. Soros, 81, was convicted in 2002 of insider trading and ordered to repay 2.2 million euros ($2.9 million) he’d made from the share purchase and subsequent sale after a Paris court found he’d acted with the knowledge that the bank might be a takeover target. While prosecutors filed criminal charges, French stock market regulators didn’t pursue Soros, saying insider-trading laws were too vague to determine whether he’d broken them. “It is inconceivable to expect that the citizen has a better understanding of the law than the authority in charge” of market regulation, Ron Soffer, Soros’s lawyer, said. “The opinion of the regulatory authority is an irrebuttable presumption as to the lack of clarity of the law.” Soros will appeal the four-to-three ruling to the court’s Grand Chamber, Soffer said. Interviews/Speeches Czech Government Opposes Financial Transaction Tax, Necas Says The Czech government opposes introduction of a financial transaction tax and issuance of joint euro-area bonds, Prime Minister Petr Necas said. Necas was speaking to reporters yesterday after the weekly Cabinet meeting in Prague. ECB’s Liikanen Says It’s Important to Focus on Systemic Risks European Central Bank Governing Council member Erkki Liikanen said policy makers should learn from past experience and focus on systemic risk. He made the remarks at a conference in Kiel, Germany, yesterday. “This big financial crisis follows the same sequence of events” as previous crises, including high leverage, bursting bubbles, a financial crisis, recession and sovereign debt crises, Liikanen said. “It is extremely important that we never neglect history the way we did a few years ago. If the financial sector grows out of proportion it’s always associated with risks,” Liikanen added. IASB Chief Urges U.S. to Adopt International Accounting Rules U.S. regulators should adopt international accounting rules, known as IFRS, to improve transparency, the chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board said yesterday. Adopting the standards would give U.S. companies “the same financial reporting language for both internal management reporting and external financial reporting on a worldwide consolidated basis,” Hans Hoogervorst, IASB chairman, said in a speech in Boston. Hoogervorst this week criticized U.S. accounting rules that differ from standards set by the IASB during a hearing in the European Parliament. Banks don’t need to show all their derivatives exposure on their balance sheet under U.S. rules, known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, he said. Comings and Goings JPMorgan Derivatives-Risk Assessor Pugachevsky Joins Quantifi JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s Dmitry Pugachevsky, who oversaw analysis of some of the bank’s derivatives risks, joined Quantifi Inc. to run the research division. Pugachevsky was the head of counterparty credit modeling at New York-based JPMorgan. Before that, he was the global head of credit analytics at Bear Stearns Cos. Changes to derivatives regulation in the U.S. and new international capital rules for banks “have brought a heightened focus on counterparty risk and highlight the need for firms to adopt active counterparty risk-management systems,” Pugachevsky said in a statement released by Summit, New Jersey- based Quantifi yesterday.

"Samsung Profit Beats Estimates as Galaxy Smartphones Challenge Apple, HTC",['Jun Yang'],2011-10-07 08:19:32,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/samsung-third-quarter-profit-beats-estimates-on-galaxy-smartphone-demand.html,"Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s second-largest maker of mobile phones, reported profit that beat analysts’ estimates as demand for Galaxy smartphones outweighed slumping sales of displays and semiconductors. Operating profit in the three months ended September was 4.2 trillion won ($3.6 billion), the Suwon, South Korea-based company said in a statement today, more than the 3.7 trillion won average of 28 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company had a profit of 4.86 trillion won a year earlier. Samsung joins HTC Corp. (2498) in benefiting from the popularity of mobile devices running Google Inc.’s Android software. The gains in smartphones, where Samsung is second only to Apple Inc. (AAPL) , helped offset falling profit from the biggest business of selling memory chips and flat-screen panels. “I’m quite amazed,” said Lee Seung Woo, a Seoul-based analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. “It seems like there was a big surprise on the smartphone side.” Samsung rose 0.6 percent to 860,000 won at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Seoul, after earlier climbing as much as 3 percent. The benchmark Kospi index gained 2.9 percent. Operating profit may be 200 billion won higher or lower than today’s preliminary estimate when audited results are announced later this month, Samsung said. The company didn’t provide net income figures and a breakdown of divisional earnings. Sales rose 1.9 percent to 41 trillion won. Mobile Business Profit at the telecommunications unit likely jumped 76 percent to 1.99 trillion won, according to a Bloomberg News survey of six analysts. Sales at the division may have gained 28 percent to 14.21 trillion won. The company, which aims to sell more than 60 million smartphones this year, probably shipped half of that in the third quarter, Shinyoung’s Lee said. Samsung will likely meet its target to sell more than 300 million handsets this year, including basic models, J.K. Shin, head of Samsung’s mobile-phone division, said Sept. 26. The South Korean company’s sales accelerated from the second quarter after it began selling the Galaxy S II , a successor to its best-selling Android device introduced last year to counter Apple’s iPhone. The latest 4.27-inch model was unveiled in February. The company has rolled out a new version of the Galaxy S II that supports faster fourth-generation networks using the long- term evolution, or LTE, technology, a feature lacking in the latest iPhone. Chip Profit Drops Profit at the semiconductor division, Samsung’s biggest business by revenue last year, probably fell 63 percent to 1.26 trillion won from a year ago, according to the median of a survey of six analysts by Bloomberg News. Sales may have fallen to 8.98 trillion won from 10.66 trillion won. Weakening demand for computer-memory chips also hurt Micron Technology Inc. (MU) , the largest U.S. maker of the product used in personal computers. On Sept. 29, Micron reported a net loss of $135 million for the fiscal fourth quarter. The price of the benchmark DDR3 2-gigabit DRAM has slumped more than 70 percent in the past 12 months, according to data from Taipei-based Dramexchange Technology Inc., operator of Asia ’s largest spot market for semiconductors. No Rebound There won’t likely be “a drastic rebound” in prices for chips used in personal computers, Kwon Oh Hyun, head of the company’s chip division, said in an e-mail interview on Sept. 29. The company’s chip business is “on track” with the capital expenditure plan for 2011, he said without elaborating. Global personal-computer shipments will rise 3.8 percent to 364 million units in 2011, compared with an earlier projection of 9.3 percent, research firm Gartner Inc. said on Sept. 8. Shipments will probably increase 10.9 percent in 2012, the Stamford, Connecticut-based company said. Samsung, which controls about 40 percent of the DRAM market, last month began operations at a new 12-trillion won factory, the largest in the industry, in Hwaseong, outside Seoul. LCD, TVs Samsung’s display division likely had an operating loss of 200 billion won, compared with 520 billion won profit a year earlier as TV sales fell amid an economic slowdown, according to the survey of analysts. The loss would be the company’s third in as many quarters. The average price of Samsung’s LCD displays for televisions probably fell about 25 percent in the third quarter, according to Hana Daetoo Securities Co. estimates. Samsung’s TV-making unit likely had an operating profit of 359.5 billion won from a loss of 230 billion won a year ago, helped by models featuring 3-D functionality and Web-based services, according to the survey. Sales at the unit probably rose to 14.92 trillion won from 14.13 trillion won, it said.

Jobs Waged Eight-Year Health Fight After Rare Cancer Diagnosis,['John Lauerman'],2011-10-06 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/jobs-s-death-follows-eight-year-health-fight-after-rare-cancer.html,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) co-founder Steve Jobs ’s death yesterday at age 56 follows years of health struggles that began in 2003, when he was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs had a neuroendocrine tumor , which is less aggressive than some other types of pancreatic malignancies. He eventually resigned as chief executive officer on Aug. 24, saying he could “no longer meet my duties and expectations.” Neuroendocrine tumors can grow slowly and be treated successfully with early removal. Those that spread to other organs, such as the liver, can be life-threatening. Without specifying a reason, Jobs had a liver transplant in 2009, a treatment that can prolong the lives of patients with his type of cancer. Not all doctors endorse the approach. No more than 60 percent of patients who had transplants for this purpose survived five years after surgery, according to an analysis published in the World Journal of Gastroenterology in 2005. The author, David Metz, is associate chief of gastroenterology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. He has said that his data was of varying quality and that survival odds may be better today. Jobs had been on medical leave since Jan. 17. It was his third leave since 2004, when he first announced he had a tumor removed. Both he and Apple closely guarded his medical information. Complications A patient who had a liver transplant after a neuroendocrine tumor might suffer from a number of complications, Simon Lo , director of endoscopy at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles , said after Jobs resigned in August. Among the possibilities was a return of the original cancer, leading to pain, fatigue, and disruption of digestion, Lo said then. Transplant patients also take immune-suppressing drugs that can raise the risk of infections and new cancers, Lo had said. Two new drugs won U.S. clearance as neuroendocrine tumor treatments this year: Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s Sutent and Novartis AG’s Afinitor. Doctors in Europe are also using new radiation treatments for the disease. Neuroendocrine tumors are uncommon, with new cases occurring in no more than five people in every 100,000 each year, according to Rodney Hicks, professor of medicine and radiology at the University of Melbourne. Doctors are still trying to understand these rare tumors, which in August Hicks said range from benign to very aggressive.

Apple Security Officials Talked to City Police Days Before Jobs’s Death,['Karen Gullo'],2011-10-07 04:01:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/apple-security-deparment-met-with-palo-alto-police-days-before-jobs-died.html,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) security officials met with police in Palo Alto , California , this week to notify them that Steve Jobs was close to death, a spokeswoman with the police department said. Following the meeting, the police devised a plan to put patrols in the area around the former Apple chief executive officer’s Palo Alto home once they heard from the company that he had died, according to Sandra Brown, the spokeswoman. The Apple representatives told the police department there was “a possibility that it could happen this week,” Brown said in a phone interview. “It’s common sense for us to work together. If you think about who he was and his contribution to the world, people might come out in masses.” Jobs, who resigned as Apple’s CEO on Aug. 24, died Oct. 5, the Cupertino, California-based company said. Jobs, 56, had been diagnosed in 2003 with a neuroendocrine tumor, a rare form of pancreatic cancer, and underwent a liver transplant in 2009. Apple unveiled the latest version of its iPhone, the product that accounts for almost half of the company’s sales, on Oct. 4, the day before his death. Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesman, declined to comment about the police meeting. Jobs lived in a home that was modest, for a person of his means, on a public street open to pedestrians and traffic. The extra patrols were necessary for safety reasons, Brown said. ‘Compounds and Walls’ “There are other people here in town, they have compounds and walls,” said Brown. “He didn’t want to have security around.” Apple was supposed to inform the police of Jobs’s death before making a public announcement so the department could prepare, said Brown. Instead, police learned he had died when the company issued a press release at about 4:30 p.m. local time on Oct. 5. As it turned out, Brown said, only about 40 people showed up around Jobs’s home that day. “Here’s a guy who’s a billionaire and lives in a regular neighborhood, not behind a gated estate with all the security guards,” said Bruce Gee, a former Apple employee who drove up from his home a couple miles away. “On Halloween, people go trick or treating there like everyone else.” Mourners gathered at Apple stores around the world and took to the Internet and social media to express their grief.

(AAPL) security officials met with police in Palo Alto , California , this week to notify them that Steve Jobs was close to death, a spokeswoman with the police department said. Following the meeting, the police devised a plan to put patrols in the area around the former Apple chief executive officer’s Palo Alto home once they heard from the company that he had died, according to Sandra Brown, the spokeswoman. The Apple representatives told the police department there was “a possibility that it could happen this week,” Brown said in a phone interview. “It’s common sense for us to work together. If you think about who he was and his contribution to the world, people might come out in masses.” Jobs, who resigned as Apple’s CEO on Aug. 24, died Oct. 5, the Cupertino, California-based company said. Jobs, 56, had been diagnosed in 2003 with a neuroendocrine tumor, a rare form of pancreatic cancer, and underwent a liver transplant in 2009. Apple unveiled the latest version of its iPhone, the product that accounts for almost half of the company’s sales, on Oct. 4, the day before his death. Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesman, declined to comment about the police meeting. Jobs lived in a home that was modest, for a person of his means, on a public street open to pedestrians and traffic. The extra patrols were necessary for safety reasons, Brown said. ‘Compounds and Walls’ “There are other people here in town, they have compounds and walls,” said Brown. “He didn’t want to have security around.” Apple was supposed to inform the police of Jobs’s death before making a public announcement so the department could prepare, said Brown. Instead, police learned he had died when the company issued a press release at about 4:30 p.m. local time on Oct. 5. As it turned out, Brown said, only about 40 people showed up around Jobs’s home that day. “Here’s a guy who’s a billionaire and lives in a regular neighborhood, not behind a gated estate with all the security guards,” said Bruce Gee, a former Apple employee who drove up from his home a couple miles away. “On Halloween, people go trick or treating there like everyone else.” Mourners gathered at Apple stores around the world and took to the Internet and social media to express their grief.

"Steve Jobs’s Death Struck Like John Lennon, JFK Getting Shot, Wozniak Says",['An' 'Krishnamoorthy' 'Susan Li'],2011-10-06 07:22:02,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/steve-jobs-s-death-struck-like-john-lennon-jfk-getting-shot-wozniak-says.html,"Steve Wozniak , who started Apple Inc. (AAPL) with high-school friend Steve Jobs in a California garage more than three decades ago, said news of his partner’s death struck him just like the shootings of John Lennon and John F. Kennedy. “I’m just totally awestruck, a bit shocked, a bit surprised,” Wozniak, 61, said in an interview today with Bloomberg Television’s Susan Li on the “Asia Edge” program. “I did not expect it. It felt a lot like you just heard that, you know, John Lennon got shot, or JFK, or Martin Luther King .” Jobs, 56, who resigned as Apple’s chief executive officer in August, died yesterday, the Cupertino, California-based company said. He was diagnosed in 2003 with a neuroendocrine tumor, a rare form of pancreatic cancer, and had a liver transplant in 2009. Wozniak teamed up with Jobs, whom he met in the early 1970s, and the two started working together on projects, with Wozniak being the tech genius and Jobs the brash idea man. The pair demonstrated the Apple I and Apple II personal computers at gatherings of the informal Homebrew Computer Club in 1975. ‘Strong Friendship’ “He was one of those cool guys,” Wozniak said. “He knew technology, he understood it. We talked about the philosophies of the day -- the counterculture was strong, the hippie movement, words in songs -- and went to concerts together. ‘‘It was a strong friendship. The technology was happening on the side.’’ They founded Apple Computer on April 1, 1976. The company’s first investor, Mike Markkula, bought a 33 percent stake for $250,000 and later served as president and chairman. Twelve months later, the company introduced the Apple II. It was a hit and became the first widely used home computer. Company sales reached $117 million in fiscal 1980, the year Apple went public at $22 a share. Jobs left the company in 1985 after a dispute with the board and Chief Executive Officer John Sculley before returning in 1996. Five years later, Apple introduced the iPod. ‘‘I got to watch the whole growth in him,’’ Wozniak said. ‘‘Coming from a young kid to starting a company and having success and trying to find ways to manage things and have his own control and power. Going off from the company, coming back very learned, knowledgeable about how to watch the operations.’’ ‘Normal Self Again’ The company dropped the word ‘‘computer’’ from its name in 2007 after entering the smartphone market with the iPhone. More success came with the introduction of the iPad, which dominates the global tablet-computer market with almost 75 percent market share. Burgeoning profits and record sales of phones, computers and tablets helped Apple become the world’s most valuable company for a time earlier this year. It remains the world’s most valuable technology company, trumping long-time rival Microsoft Corp. ‘‘Steve, the last few times he talked to me, was having all these strong reflections of those early days and how much they meant and how much fun,” Wozniak said. “He would even say things like, ‘Did you ever think this would happen?’ ‘‘‘Look how great, big Apple got as a technology company.’ He was really getting excited about these things. He was kind of like his normal, young self again.’’ ‘Hard to Sleep’ Wozniak said his last conversation with Jobs scared him because he could tell that his friend’s health wasn’t good. ‘‘He sounded a little weak in the character and the voice and the motivation,” Wozniak said. “I was a little bit scared on the phone. He didn’t sound as strong as he did the conversation before.” Wozniak said he had “so many memories” of Jobs, who was fired by Apple’s board in 1985 after a power struggle. Apple’s purchase of NeXT software in 1997 brought Jobs back to the company and he became a “confident manager” knowing what he needed to do to make a profit, Wozniak said. “And that’s what led to the great products,” he said. “Most people are going to miss the great products. And they’ll just see Steve in them forever. ‘‘That’s why we’re stunned so much. It’s going to be hard to sleep tonight.” To contact the reporters on the story: Anand Krishnamoorthy in Singapore at  anandk@bloomberg.net ; Susan Li in Hong Kong at  sli31@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at  ycho2@bloomberg.net .",['AnKrishnamoorthySusan Li'],"Steve Jobs’s Death Struck Like John Lennon, JFK Getting Shot, Wozniak Says Steve Wozniak , who started Apple Inc.

Apple Looks to Overseas Growth to Stay on Top Without Jobs: Tech,['Adam Satariano'],2011-10-06 20:08:41,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/apple-looks-to-overseas-growth-to-stay-on-top-without-visionary-jobs-tech.html,"Steve Jobs built Apple Inc. into the world’s most valuable technology company with easy-to-use products that transformed the computing, wireless and music industries. The company will look for overseas growth to extend that legacy and remain an investor favorite. Apple, which said its visionary founder died yesterday at 56, aims to maintain its expansion in markets such as China , fueling sales of the iPhone and iPad. The company also stands to gain from updated versions of those best-sellers and the new iCloud service, which makes it easier for its gadgets to share information -- and harder for users to switch to rival devices. For Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook , the challenge will be developing Apple’s next generation of hot sellers and facing down competition in the markets Jobs pioneered. Google Inc.’s Android has emerged as one of Apple’s biggest threats after gaining momentum in phones and tablets. Cook, who this week led the debut of the iPhone 4S, will lean on a cadre of fellow veteran executives who have long worked together under Jobs. “He created an infrastructure that this management team can build on for a long time,” said Tim Bajarin , a technology analyst at Creative Strategies Inc. “The bigger question is how fast will they innovate and take advantage of that infrastructure for things like new devices, applications and services.” Jobs had resigned as Apple Inc. (AAPL) chief executive officer on Aug. 24. He was diagnosed in 2003 with a neuroendocrine tumor, a rare form of pancreatic cancer, and had a liver transplant in 2009. Apple Investors Investors have had mixed reactions since Jobs stepped down as CEO. The shares rose more than 7 percent in the month after he resigned, and have since slipped back to little changed. The stock fell 88 cents to $377.37 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares are recommended by 49 analysts, with no sell ratings, according to Bloomberg data. On average, analysts predict the shares will rise another 32 percent to $499.40. “Steve Jobs has set up the company for the next few years to have some more blockbuster products,” said Giri Cherukuri , an Apple investor with Oakbrook Investments who has been following the company since the late 1980s. Updated models of the iPhone and iPad, as well as potential new products like a television, will keep the company growing, he said. ‘Final Great Act’ Apple’s stock price has risen more than 9,000 percent since Jobs returned to the company in 1997. The stock has more than doubled in the past two years, while Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) has gained 5.1 percent and Intel Corp. (INTC) has risen 14 percent. Hewlett- Packard Co. is down 48 percent. While analysts once predicted that Apple shares would plunge when Jobs left the company, investors have grown more comfortable with other executives since he first went on medical leave in 2004. In 2008, Piper Jaffray Cos. analyst Gene Munster estimated that Apple shares would tumble 25 percent if Jobs departed. Munster, who now has a target price of $607 for the stock, said Jobs’s “final great act” was grooming Cook as a successor. Apple benefited from record purchases of iPads and iPhones in the quarter that ended in June, helping profit more than double to $7.31 billion. Sales climbed 82 percent $28.6 billion. “For now, people are comfortable, but that could change if there are signs to the contrary,” said Mike Abramsky , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. Cook’s Team In addition to Cook, Apple’s executive team includes Jonathan Ive, senior vice president of industrial design; Scott Forstall , who is in charge of the iOS software that powers the iPhone and iPad; and Philip Schiller, who leads product marketing. Additionally, Bob Mansfield heads Mac hardware engineering; Eddy Cue runs iTunes, the App Store and iCloud; Bruce Sewell is chief counsel, putting him at the helm of the company’s patent disputes; and Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer is tasked with overseeing Apple’s more than $75 billion in cash and long-term holdings. While Apple has turned its website into a memorial to Jobs and is flying the flags at its Cupertino, California, headquarters at half-mast, the company will quickly have to shift its focus back to the looming release of the iPhone 4S. The device, unveiled Oct. 4, goes on sale Oct. 14. Nokia, RIM The iPhone helped Apple upend the mobile-phone industry, increasing the popularity of touch-screen devices. That came at the expense of Nokia Oyj and Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) , which have lost market share and shed workers. As Apple’s sales and profit grew, its market value soared past rival technology companies. Its valuation now exceeds the combined worth of Microsoft and Intel, two companies that once pushed Apple to the fringes of the personal-computer industry. To stay on top, Apple will have to maintain its expansion in China, where the company generated about $3.8 billion in the most recent quarter, up more than sixfold from a year earlier. The company’s retail outlet in Shanghai had 100,000 visitors on its opening weekend, Cook said at the iPhone 4S event. Apple is opening its first store in Hong Kong this year. The new version of the iPhone, Apple’s top money-maker, will face competition from Samsung Electronics Co., Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. and HTC Corp., which use Android software in their smartphones. New Products Apple’s ICloud, which lets customers access pictures, music and other information across a broad range of its devices, will be released on Oct. 12. The service was first showcased at Jobs’s last public appearance, Apple’s developer conference in June. When Apple needs to introduce entirely new products, Jobs’s vision may be missed -- if the company introduces a TV, for example, Piper Jaffray’s Munster said. Jobs was critical in hiring and pushing the company into new areas, Abramsky said. He was vital in negotiations with media companies for securing content such as music and movies that are sold through iTunes. “There’s a certain unknown about how Apple will be different,” Abramsky said.

In 2008, Piper Jaffray Cos. analyst Gene Munster estimated that Apple shares would tumble 25 percent if Jobs departed. Munster, who now has a target price of $607 for the stock, said Jobs’s “final great act” was grooming Cook as a successor. Apple benefited from record purchases of iPads and iPhones in the quarter that ended in June, helping profit more than double to $7.31 billion. Sales climbed 82 percent $28.6 billion. “For now, people are comfortable, but that could change if there are signs to the contrary,” said Mike Abramsky , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. Cook’s Team In addition to Cook, Apple’s executive team includes Jonathan Ive, senior vice president of industrial design; Scott Forstall , who is in charge of the iOS software that powers the iPhone and iPad; and Philip Schiller, who leads product marketing. Additionally, Bob Mansfield heads Mac hardware engineering; Eddy Cue runs iTunes, the App Store and iCloud; Bruce Sewell is chief counsel, putting him at the helm of the company’s patent disputes; and Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer is tasked with overseeing Apple’s more than $75 billion in cash and long-term holdings. While Apple has turned its website into a memorial to Jobs and is flying the flags at its Cupertino, California, headquarters at half-mast, the company will quickly have to shift its focus back to the looming release of the iPhone 4S. The device, unveiled Oct. 4, goes on sale Oct. 14. Nokia, RIM The iPhone helped Apple upend the mobile-phone industry, increasing the popularity of touch-screen devices. That came at the expense of Nokia Oyj and Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) , which have lost market share and shed workers. As Apple’s sales and profit grew, its market value soared past rival technology companies. Its valuation now exceeds the combined worth of Microsoft and Intel, two companies that once pushed Apple to the fringes of the personal-computer industry. To stay on top, Apple will have to maintain its expansion in China, where the company generated about $3.8 billion in the most recent quarter, up more than sixfold from a year earlier. The company’s retail outlet in Shanghai had 100,000 visitors on its opening weekend, Cook said at the iPhone 4S event. Apple is opening its first store in Hong Kong this year. The new version of the iPhone, Apple’s top money-maker, will face competition from Samsung Electronics Co., Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. and HTC Corp., which use Android software in their smartphones. New Products Apple’s ICloud, which lets customers access pictures, music and other information across a broad range of its devices, will be released on Oct. 12. The service was first showcased at Jobs’s last public appearance, Apple’s developer conference in June. When Apple needs to introduce entirely new products, Jobs’s vision may be missed -- if the company introduces a TV, for example, Piper Jaffray’s Munster said. Jobs was critical in hiring and pushing the company into new areas, Abramsky said. He was vital in negotiations with media companies for securing content such as music and movies that are sold through iTunes. “There’s a certain unknown about how Apple will be different,” Abramsky said.

"Stocks, Euro Advance as Treasuries Drop",['Michael P.Regan' 'Rita Nazareth'],2011-10-06 21:28:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/asia-stocks-south-korea-won-gain-on-upbeat-u-s-data-nasdaq-futures-fall.html,"U.S. stocks rallied for a third day, commodities gained and Treasuries slid as European officials detailed plans to tame the sovereign debt crisis and reports on retail sales and jobless claims bolstered optimism in the economy. The euro reversed an earlier drop versus the dollar. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.8 percent to 1,164.97 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Russell 2000 Index of smaller U.S. stocks extended a three-day advance to 11 percent, its best since 2009. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index surged 2.7 percent. Ten-year Treasury yields added 10 basis points to 1.99 percent. The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.3439 after losing 0.8 percent. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities jumped 2.5 percent as oil increased 3.7 percent to $82.59 a barrel. American equities extended a global rally after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said the ECB will resume covered-bond purchases and reintroduce yearlong loans for banks, while defying calls for an interest-rate cut and acknowledging “downside risks” to the economy have intensified. The European Commission is pushing for a coordinated capital injection for banks to shield them from the fallout of a potential Greek default. “People have priced in a Lehman II type of situation,” Brian Barish, Denver-based president of Cambiar Investors LLC, which oversees about $8 billion, said in a telephone interview. “You start to hear some credible stuff on European bank recapitalization. They will do what they’ve got to do to prevent a Lehman from happening. There’s a good chance we might’ve had a bottom in stocks.” Covered Bonds The 2.5 trillion-euro market for covered bonds -- assets backed by mortgages or public-sector loans -- underpins much of Europe ’s real estate lending, which almost ground to a halt in the wake of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s collapse in September 2008. U.S. stocks also climbed after claims for unemployment benefits rose less than forecast last week to a level that shows the pace of dismissals may be slowing. Applications for jobless benefits climbed by 6,000 to 401,000, Labor Department figures showed. Economists projected 410,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The monthly average dropped to the lowest level since the end of August. Government data tomorrow are forecast to show employers added 55,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate held at 9.1 percent, according to the median estimates. Bear Market Averted The S&P 500 has rebounded 6 percent since Oct. 3, when it closed within 1 percent of a level that would have marked a bear-market plunge of 20 percent from its April peak. The S&P GSCI commodities gauge is up 5.3 percent in two days, its best back-to-back advance since May, and has trimmed its drop from this year’s high to 20 percent. Treasury yields have increased after demand for safer assets dragged the 10-year note’s rate to a record low of 1.67 percent on Sept. 23. The Dollar Index has slipped about 1.1 percent since Oct. 4, when it reached the highest level since January. Indexes of financial, commodity and consumer companies rose at least 2.2 percent today to lead gains in all 10 industry groups in the S&P 500. Bank of America Corp. jumped 8.8 percent and Alcoa Inc. rallied 5.4 percent for the top gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The S&P 500 Financials Index has rallied 8.8 percent in three days, its steepest advance since July 2009, to trim its year-to-date loss to 23 percent. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner told the Senate Banking Committee today that there is “absolutely” no chance of another U.S. financial institution collapsing like Lehman Brothers. Retail Sales, Apple Target Corp. climbed 4.3 percent today and Limited Brands Inc. and Saks Inc. also rose after reporting September sales that surpassed analysts’ projections. Apple Inc. shares slipped 0.2 percent after co-founder Steve Jobs died. The cost to protect the debt of Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. declined amid growing speculation Europe’s leaders will be able to prevent the debt crisis from infecting bank balance sheets. Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley, the owner of the world’s biggest retail brokerage, fell 55 basis points to 475, the biggest decline since May 2009, and those on Citigroup slid 40.5 basis points to 304.57, the largest drop since Nov. 24, 2008, according to data provider CMA. Swaps on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. eased 25 basis points to 371, the data show. Wall Street strategists say the S&P 500 will post the biggest fourth-quarter rally in 13 years even after they cut forecasts at a rate exceeded only during the credit crisis. The benchmark index for U.S. stocks will climb 14 percent from yesterday to end 2011 at 1,300, according to the average estimate of 12 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. The last time they were this bullish in October was 2008, when the group predicted a 27 percent gain and the index lost 18 percent. Trading Range Excluding its dip to a 13-month closing low of 1,099.23 on Oct. 3, the S&P 500 has mostly traded between about 1,120 and 1,220 for the past two months. Following 14 periods since 1990 when the index was stuck in a range, more than 75 percent resulted in gains in the next one, three and six months, according to Birinyi Associates Inc., the Westport, Connecticut- based money management and research firm. The average trading range studied lasted about seven months, with the shortest beginning in March 1998 and lasting three months, Birinyi data show. “We’ll need clear economic data or policy movements out of Europe to break out of that range,” Wasif Latif, vice president of equity investments at USAA Investment Management Co. in San Antonio , which oversees about $50 billion, said in a telephone interview. Earnings Season Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S. aluminum producer, will mark the unofficial start of the earnings-reporting season when it reports results on Oct. 11. Third-quarter profits for S&P 500 companies are projected to have grown 13 percent, according to analyst forecast compiled by Bloomberg, down from an estimate of 17 percent when the index traded at a three-year high at the end of April. Among European stocks, BNP Paribas SA, Credit Agricole SA and Natixis surged at least 5.3 percent after Le Figaro said the French government is working on a contingency plan to take stakes in the country’s lenders. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest mining company, rallied 5.9 percent as metal prices increased. SABMiller Plc surged 7 percent after a report by Brazilian news website IG said the brewer is in talks to be bought by Anheuser-Busch InBev NV. Spokespeople for both companies declined to comment. Bonds, Currencies Ten-year Spanish and Italian bond yields decreased seven basis points each, while rates on U.K., French and German debt rose at least four points. The dollar weakened against 14 of 16 major peers today, with the Brazilian real surging 2.7 percent to lead gains after higher-than-forecast inflation spurred bets the central bank may slow the pace of interest-rate cuts. The euro strengthened versus 10 of 16 major peers. The pound slid against all 16 major peers after the Bank of England expanded its bond-purchase program. The Australian and New Zealand currencies strengthened against most peers. Copper futures climbed 4.5 percent to $3.2465 a pound in New York and rallied 5.9 percent in London to lead gains in 19 of 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI Index. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of stocks surged 3.7 percent, extending its rebound from a two-year low on Oct. 4. Benchmark indexes in South Korea , Brazil and Chile climbed at least 2.5 percent.

Jobs Rose From Computers in Parents’ Garage to Technology Icon: Timeline,['Joel Stonington'],2011-10-06 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/jobs-rose-from-parents-garage-to-technology-icon-timeline.html,"Steve Jobs was a college dropout who built computers in his parents’ garage in the mid-1970s with a friend, Steve Wozniak. They founded what is now Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 1976 to sell their creations. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, surpassed Microsoft Corp. in 2010 to become the world’s most valuable technology company. A timeline of Jobs’s career follows: Feb. 24, 1955: A boy is born in San Francisco to college graduate students Joanne Carole Schieble and Syrian immigrant Abdulfattah “John” Jandali. Jobs said in a 1997 New York Times Magazine article that he wouldn’t talk about his biological parents, citing privacy. He is adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs, who name him Steven Paul Jobs and raise him in the suburbs of Mountain View and Los Altos, California. 1972: Jobs graduates from Homestead High School, the Cupertino school that is also the alma mater of Wozniak, his future business partner. Jobs enrolls at Reed College in Portland , Oregon , and drops out after one semester. “The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting,” he said during a June 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University. 1974: Jobs returns to California and works as a designer at Atari Corp., the video-game company. He later travels to India in search of spiritual enlightenment. 1975: Jobs and Wozniak hang out at Homebrew Computer Club, an informal gathering of engineers and hobbyists who swap parts and ideas. The two show off the Apple I and Apple II computers at the club meetings, according to an article written by Wozniak. April 1, 1976: Jobs, Wozniak and Ron Wayne found Apple. Wayne, who worked with Jobs at Atari, gives up his 10 percent share of Apple less than two weeks later. April 16, 1977: Wozniak and Jobs introduce the Apple II, which becomes one of the first successful personal computers. May 1978: Jobs’ girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, gives birth to a girl, Lisa Brennan-Jobs. Chrisann raises Lisa mainly on her own. Jobs later reconciles with Lisa. Dec. 12, 1980: Apple goes public at $22 a share. Adjusted for splits since then, the initial public offering price is $2.75. Apple closed yesterday at $378.25. February 1982: Jobs, 26, is featured on the cover of Time under the headline, “Striking It Rich, America’s Risk Takers.” He appears on the magazine’s cover more than a half dozen times. January 1983: Apple releases the Lisa, the first commercially sold computer with a graphical user interface. The Lisa, with a price tag of $9,995, is a commercial failure. January 1984: Apple announces the new Macintosh computer with an ad that airs only once, during the Super Bowl. The ad shows a woman throw a hammer at a giant screen as a voice reads, “On January 24, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh and you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like ‘1984.’” The Mac, which sells for $2,500, becomes the first commercially successful personal computer to have a graphical user interface and mouse. September 1985: After being stripped of responsibilities amid a power struggle with Chief Executive Officer John Sculley and the board, Jobs resigns as chairman. He tells the board: “I’ve been thinking a lot and it’s time for me to get on with my life. It’s obvious that I’ve got to do something. I’m 30 years old,” according to Sculley’s book, “Odyssey: Pepsi to Apple.” Jobs soon starts NeXT Computer Inc., which builds high-powered educational computers. February 1986: Jobs buys George Lucas’s computer-graphics shop for $10 million and renames it Pixar Inc. March 18, 1991: He marries Laurene Powell at a hotel in Yosemite National Park. Their first child, Reed, is born in September, followed by daughters Erin in 1995 and Eve in 1998. February 1993: NeXT decides to stop making computer workstations and lays off more than half of its 540 employees. November 1995: Pixar releases its first feature film, “Toy Story,” which grosses more than $360 million and is nominated for three Oscars. In the same month, the company goes public. Jobs would say in a 1998 BusinessWeek article , “I think Pixar has the opportunity to be the next Disney -- not replace Disney",['Joel Stonington'],"Jobs Rose From Computers in Parents’ Garage to Technology Icon: Timeline Steve Jobs was a college dropout who built computers in his parents’ garage in the mid-1970s with a friend, Steve Wozniak.

The two show off the Apple I and Apple II computers at the club meetings, according to an article written by Wozniak. April 1, 1976: Jobs, Wozniak and Ron Wayne found Apple. Wayne, who worked with Jobs at Atari, gives up his 10 percent share of Apple less than two weeks later. April 16, 1977: Wozniak and Jobs introduce the Apple II, which becomes one of the first successful personal computers. May 1978: Jobs’ girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, gives birth to a girl, Lisa Brennan-Jobs. Chrisann raises Lisa mainly on her own. Jobs later reconciles with Lisa. Dec. 12, 1980: Apple goes public at $22 a share. Adjusted for splits since then, the initial public offering price is $2.75. Apple closed yesterday at $378.25. February 1982: Jobs, 26, is featured on the cover of Time under the headline, “Striking It Rich, America’s Risk Takers.” He appears on the magazine’s cover more than a half dozen times. January 1983: Apple releases the Lisa, the first commercially sold computer with a graphical user interface. The Lisa, with a price tag of $9,995, is a commercial failure. January 1984: Apple announces the new Macintosh computer with an ad that airs only once, during the Super Bowl. The ad shows a woman throw a hammer at a giant screen as a voice reads, “On January 24, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh and you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like ‘1984.’” The Mac, which sells for $2,500, becomes the first commercially successful personal computer to have a graphical user interface and mouse. September 1985: After being stripped of responsibilities amid a power struggle with Chief Executive Officer John Sculley and the board, Jobs resigns as chairman. He tells the board: “I’ve been thinking a lot and it’s time for me to get on with my life. It’s obvious that I’ve got to do something. I’m 30 years old,” according to Sculley’s book, “Odyssey: Pepsi to Apple.” Jobs soon starts NeXT Computer Inc., which builds high-powered educational computers. February 1986: Jobs buys George Lucas’s computer-graphics shop for $10 million and renames it Pixar Inc. March 18, 1991: He marries Laurene Powell at a hotel in Yosemite National Park. Their first child, Reed, is born in September, followed by daughters Erin in 1995 and Eve in 1998. February 1993: NeXT decides to stop making computer workstations and lays off more than half of its 540 employees. November 1995: Pixar releases its first feature film, “Toy Story,” which grosses more than $360 million and is nominated for three Oscars. In the same month, the company goes public. Jobs would say in a 1998 BusinessWeek article , “I think Pixar has the opportunity to be the next Disney -- not replace Disney",4256,715,-1
Apple General Counsel Sewell Becomes Protector of Jobs’s Vision,['Susan Decker'],2011-10-06 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/apple-general-counsel-sewell-becomes-protector-of-jobs-s-vision.html,"If Steve Jobs was the creative force that made Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s products hip, General Counsel Bruce Sewell is the authority in keeping competitors from copying those ideas. Hired from Intel Corp. (INTC) in 2009, Sewell, 52, has led Apple’s fight against mobile devices running Google Inc.’s Android operating system in lawsuits spanning four continents. His biggest role has been in coordinating the Cupertino, California- based company’s legal strategy against Android customers Samsung Electronics Co., Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. and HTC Corp. (2498)  Before Sewell, Apple rarely filed lawsuits, typically only targeting small companies making unapproved accessories for Mac computers or, as with the case against Nokia Oyj (NOK) , retaliating for a suit against it. Then came the iPhone. Jobs unveiled the iPhone in 2007, saying Apple had applied for more than 200 patents for the device and was ready to enforce them. Within six months of being hired in 2009, Sewell put those words into action when the company filed its first pro-active patent-infringement suit against an Android handset maker, seeking an order to ban some phones made by Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC from the U.S. Since then, Apple also has sued to stop sales of Samsung’s Galaxy phone and tablets, claiming the products “slavishly” copy the iPhone and iPad. Intel Antitrust Case A 1979 graduate of Lancaster University in the U.K. with a law degree from George Washington University in Washington, D.C., Sewell joined the law firm Brown & Bain in 1986. In 1995, he started at Intel, becoming general counsel a decade later. While at Intel, Sewell was in charge of defending against antitrust cases that accused the Santa Clara , California-based company of giving computer makers discounts in exchange for promises to use Intel chips exclusively. Sewell’s relationship with Apple goes back almost a decade.

Schiller Poised to Be Apple’s Top Pitchman in Post-Jobs Era,['Peter Burrows' 'Dina Bass'],2011-10-06 15:32:27,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/schiller-poised-to-become-apple-s-top-pitchman-in-post-jobs-era.html,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) called on Phil Schiller to stand in for Steve Jobs at the 2009 Macworld conference after the then-chief executive officer went on medical leave. Later that year, with Jobs still out, Schiller unveiled the iPhone 3GS. Now that Jobs is gone, Schiller is likely to become the company’s primary pitchman. Schiller, vice president for worldwide product marketing, has been the second-most-public face at Cupertino, California- based Apple for years. He’s been a fixture in Jobs’s keynotes, demonstrating new products and playing the comic sidekick. Behind the scenes, he has run the marketing empire that hones and promotes the company’s products. Schiller, 50, has always been willing to take a body blow for Apple. In 1999, he took a feet-first high dive into a mat holding an Apple laptop as part of a stunt during a Jobs MacWorld speech. He has been one of a handful of Apple executives involved in the detailed process leading to Jobs’s keynote appearances, including sitting through repeated rehearsals by executives from other companies invited to showcase their products on stage. Apple has drawn so much limelight that Schiller has become something of a high-technology celebrity himself, including a site called Schillermania devoted to his appearances. His on-stage shtick usually involves self-deprecating humor. At his MacWorld appearance in January 2009 in Jobs’s traditional slot, Schiller started off his speech by saying, “I can’t tell you how much I appreciate you all showing up,” drawing laughter and applause. Trusted Lieutenant Inside Apple, he was one of Jobs’s most trusted lieutenants. He is responsible for many of the company’s memorable product slogans and for singing the praises of Apple products, from Macs to the App Store , to the media. As head of developer relations, he’s also helped build Apple’s vast system of partners, from applications developers to makers of iPhone accessories. When Apple came under fire in 2010 from developers who felt the company was arbitrarily refusing to approve certain apps, he wrote a public memo clarifying Apple’s policies. In 2009 he defended Apple’s control of its App Store to Businessweek magazine, saying the company had “built a store for the most part that people can trust.” Schiller is a devoted fan of Boston College ’s hockey team. After graduating from the school in 1982 with a Bachelor of Science degree in biology, he worked as a programmer at Massachusetts General Hospital. He worked at Apple in the late 1980s before leaving in 1993. After working as a marketing executive at FirePower Systems Inc. and Macromedia Inc., Schiller rejoined Apple in 1997, when Jobs was a consultant to the company and had not yet returned as CEO.

The MSCI Emerging Markets Index climbed 3.3 percent to 864.08 as of 4:30 p.m. in New York , its biggest advance since Sept. 27. Brazil’s Bovespa Index jumped the most in a month while Chile’s benchmark surged the most in two months. The Kospi Index (KOSPI) in South Korea rose 2.6 percent. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong rose 5.8 percent and the Micex Index added 4.2 percent in Moscow. Reports of jobless claims at a level that shows the pace of dismissals may be slowing and rising fuel demand eased concern the U.S. economic recovery is in jeopardy. The European Central Bank said today it will resume covered-bond purchases and reintroduce yearlong loans for banks as the sovereign debt crisis threatens to lock money markets. “The market is reacting positively to all this news and sentiment is slightly better now,” Choo Swee Kee, who manages about $220 million as chief investment officer of TA Investment Management Bhd., said in a phone interview from Kuala Lumpur. “The European authorities are trying whatever measures to save their economy with as little cost as possible.” A two-day gain helped cut the losses in the MSCI emerging market gauge this month to 1.9 percent, compared with a 1.8 percent increase in the MSCI World (MXWO) Index. Stocks in the emerging-market gauge are traded at 9.8 times trailing earnings, versus 12 for equities in developed nations. Brazil, Eastern European Stocks In Brazil, oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA advanced 3.5 percent and miner Vale SA, the benchmark index’s heaviest- weighted stocks, added 1.6 percent, as improving outlook for Europe’s banking industry and the U.S. employment data buoyed commodity prices. OAO Lukoil, Russia ’s second-biggest oil producer, rose 2.6 percent and KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , Poland’s only copper producer, rallied 6.6 percent as the WIG20 Index increased 1.3 percent in Warsaw. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining company, gained 3.2 percent in Johannesburg, helping drive up the FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index by 1.4 percent. Lan Airlines SA, Latin America ’s largest airline by market value jumped 4.4 percent in Chilean trading after Spain ’s antitrust regulator approved without conditions its planned acquisition of Brazil ’s TAM SA, which climbed 2.1 percent in Sao Paulo. Emerging-Market Currencies The Brazilian real strengthened 2.9 percent versus the dollar, the best performance among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The Chilean peso followed with a 2.1 percent gain. The Turkish lira appreciated 1.2 percent against the dollar after the central bank sold $1.1 billion in two days of record-breaking auctions, depleting reserves in an attempt to stem the currency’s slide. European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said the ECB will resume covered-bond purchases and reintroduce year- long loans for banks as the sovereign debt crisis threatens to lock money markets. The ECB will spend 40 billion euros ($54 billion) on covered bonds starting next month and will offer banks two additional unlimited loans of 12 and 13-month durations, Trichet said at a press conference in Berlin today after policy makers left the benchmark interest rate at 1.5 percent. The Markit iTraxx SovX CEEMEA Index of eastern European, Middle East and Africa credit-default swaps fell 16 basis points to 337. Samsung, LG Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s second-largest maker of mobile phones, rose 1.5 percent and LG Electronics Inc.

Apple Stock Little Changed After Co-Founder Jobs Passes Away,['Julie Cruz'],2011-10-06 20:09:39,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/apple-drops-in-german-floor-trading-after-steve-jobs-s-death-from-cancer.html,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares were little changed in Nasdaq trading after co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs died. The stock dipped 88 cents to $377.37 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Apple, which has the biggest weighting among any stock in the Nasdaq-100 Index at 14 percent, has gained 17 percent this year. Jobs, who resigned as CEO on Aug. 24, passed away at 56 yesterday, Cupertino, California-based Apple said. He was diagnosed in 2003 with a neuroendocrine tumor, a rare form of pancreatic cancer, and had a liver transplant in 2009. “The drop this morning is a shock reaction,” said Andreas Lipkow, an equity trader at MWB Fairtrade Wertpapierhandelsbank AG in Frankfurt. “In his position as a visionary I think he organized things and I think the new CEO will run things really well.” The announcement of Jobs’s passing came one day after CEO Tim Cook took the stage to introduce a new iPhone, marking his first product unveiling since taking the reins. To maintain Apple’s growth, he will have to push into more new markets, continue the company’s Asian expansion and execute a shift to cloud computing. Microsoft, Intel Apple’s stock price has risen more than 9,000 percent since Jobs returned to the company in 1997. The shares have more than doubled in the past two years, while Microsoft Corp. has gained 5.1 percent and Intel Corp. has risen 14 percent. Hewlett- Packard Co. is down 48 percent. The success of the iPhone has helped Apple’s stock weather market turmoil and the resignation of the CEO who made Apple the world’s most valuable company. Investors have had mixed reactions since Jobs stepped down as CEO. The shares rose more than 7 percent in the month after he resigned, and have since slipped back to little changed. At the close of trading yesterday, Apple was valued at $351 billion. “Apple’s business model will continue, but Steve Jobs was the cleverest product innovator and most precise brand creator in history,” said Daniel Weston, a portfolio adviser at Schroeder Equities GmbH in Munich. “Someone like that will not be replaced in our lifetimes.” Shares of Asian and European rivals climbed.

(AAPL) shares were little changed in Nasdaq trading after co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs died. The stock dipped 88 cents to $377.37 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Apple, which has the biggest weighting among any stock in the Nasdaq-100 Index at 14 percent, has gained 17 percent this year. Jobs, who resigned as CEO on Aug. 24, passed away at 56 yesterday, Cupertino, California-based Apple said. He was diagnosed in 2003 with a neuroendocrine tumor, a rare form of pancreatic cancer, and had a liver transplant in 2009. “The drop this morning is a shock reaction,” said Andreas Lipkow, an equity trader at MWB Fairtrade Wertpapierhandelsbank AG in Frankfurt. “In his position as a visionary I think he organized things and I think the new CEO will run things really well.” The announcement of Jobs’s passing came one day after CEO Tim Cook took the stage to introduce a new iPhone, marking his first product unveiling since taking the reins. To maintain Apple’s growth, he will have to push into more new markets, continue the company’s Asian expansion and execute a shift to cloud computing. Microsoft, Intel Apple’s stock price has risen more than 9,000 percent since Jobs returned to the company in 1997. The shares have more than doubled in the past two years, while Microsoft Corp. has gained 5.1 percent and Intel Corp. has risen 14 percent. Hewlett- Packard Co. is down 48 percent. The success of the iPhone has helped Apple’s stock weather market turmoil and the resignation of the CEO who made Apple the world’s most valuable company. Investors have had mixed reactions since Jobs stepped down as CEO. The shares rose more than 7 percent in the month after he resigned, and have since slipped back to little changed. At the close of trading yesterday, Apple was valued at $351 billion. “Apple’s business model will continue, but Steve Jobs was the cleverest product innovator and most precise brand creator in history,” said Daniel Weston, a portfolio adviser at Schroeder Equities GmbH in Munich. “Someone like that will not be replaced in our lifetimes.” Shares of Asian and European rivals climbed. Samsung Electronics Co. climbed 1.5 percent in Seoul. LG Electronics Inc. (066570) gained 6.3 percent. Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) added 1.8 percent on the Helsinki exchange. “People see now that Steve Jobs is not coming back and there is a risk of innovation declining, because he created the innovative products that created the fantastic brand,” said Helena Nordman-Knutson, a Stockholm-based technology analyst with Oehman.

(AAPL) ’s iPhone 4S handset being sold in France and Italy on patent-infringement claims, escalating the dispute between the world’s two biggest makers of smartphones and tablets. Samsung will file motions with courts in Paris and Milan seeking the ban, each citing two patent infringements on wireless telecommunications technology, the Suwon, South Korea- based company said in an e-mailed statement Oct. 5. Apple unveiled the iPhone 4S in Cupertino, California this week and aims to start sales later this month. The move adds to legal disputes that began in April, when Apple claimed that Samsung’s Galaxy devices “slavishly” copied the iPad and iPhone. At stake is dominance in the fastest- growing segment of the $207 billion mobile-phone market, where Apple is competing against makers of handsets powered by Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system. Steve Park, a Seoul-based spokesman for Apple, declined to comment on Samsung’s statement. Florence Catel, a spokeswoman for Samsung France, didn’t have any additional information on when the suit will be filed or when a hearing will take place. Samsung plans to file preliminary injunctions in other countries after further review, it said in the statement. Apple is also one of the South Korean company’s biggest buyers of chips and displays. “Apple has continued to flagrantly violate our intellectual property rights and free ride on our technology,” Samsung said. Apple this week introduced the iPhone 4S equipped with a faster processor, a higher-resolution camera and a new software interface to help it vie with Google’s Android, which powers Samsung’s Galaxy phone and tablets. At stake is leadership in the market for smartphones, which is projected to double by 2015, when 1 billion of the handsets will be sold, according to research firm IDC. While Apple is the single biggest smartphone maker, the Android coalition leads the market, accounting for 41.7 percent. The iPhone accounted for almost half Apple’s sales in the most recent quarter. Apple had earlier won backing from a Dusseldorf court that upheld a temporary ban on sales of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Germany. Samsung filed an appeal against the ruling. In Australia , Apple has delayed the release of the product for two months by seeking a temporary judicial ban. Samsung will abandon plans to sell the Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Australia if it doesn’t win approval to sell it in the next two weeks, Neil Young, a Samsung lawyer, told Federal Court Justice Annabelle Bennett in Sydney this week. Missing the Christmas season would result in the new tablet being “dead,” he said. Oracle Trial With Google Over Java Will Probably Be Delayed Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ’s trial over whether Google Inc.’s Android software infringed its patents for Java technology will likely be postponed from its scheduled Oct. 31 start, a federal judge said. U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who will preside over the trial in San Francisco , said in a court filing yesterday that an unrelated criminal trial that will begin Oct. 17 means it’s “unlikely” the Oracle-Google case can go forward as scheduled. Alsup didn’t say when the Oracle trial would be held. Oracle is seeking billions of dollars in damages from the operator of the world’s largest search engine. The Redwood City, California-based company accuses Google of infringing its patents and copyrights for the Java programming language in the Android operating system, now running on more than 150 million mobile devices. Google, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims. The case is Oracle America Inc. v. Google Inc., 3:10-03561- WHA, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). AstraZeneca Says It Settled Seroquel Patent Suit Against Accord AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) , the London-based pharmaceutical company that makes the schizophrenia treatment Seroquel, said it settled patent litigation against Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd.’s Accord Healthcare unit that was related to the drug. According to a company statement released yesterday, as part of the settlement, Accord was been granted a license to enter the U.S. market on Nov. 1, 2016. Additionally, the Intas unit has agreed not to dispute the validity or enforceability of the patents that were at issue in the case. AstraZeneca’s remaining Seroquel patent cases are ongoing, according to the company statement. The British pharmaceutical company sued Accord in federal court in Trenton, New Jersey , in February 2009. AstraZeneca claimed Accord was infringing patents 4,879,288 and 5.948,437. The case is AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP v. Accord Healthcare Inc., 3:09-cv-00619-JAP-TJB, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Trenton). U.S. Consumer Safety Commission Votes to Study Table Saws The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission voted 5-0 yesterday to take the first steps toward regulating table saws, which have been blamed for more than 4,000 finger, hand and arm injuries a year. The agency will examine technologies, such as those offered by closely held SawStop LLC, which can stop the blade instantly when human flesh is detected and may eventually issue a rule, Scott Wolfson, an agency spokesman said. The CPSC will seek comments from the industry and the general public before moving to a more specific proposal, he said. Stephen Gass, founder of Tualatin, Oregon-based SawStop, first petitioned the CPSC more than eight years ago to consider his technology after being turned down by power-tool companies on licensing deals. The Power Tool Institute, which represents manufacturers such as Robert Bosch GmbH, Stanley Black & Decker Inc. (SWK) , Ryobi Ltd., and Techtronic Industries Co., warned that a mandatory standard could create a monopoly for Gass, who they say has locked up more than 70 patents. “Unfortunately, for consumers, such a mandatory standard could as much as quadruple the cost of current, inexpensive saws and significantly increase the cost of professional saws on the market today,” Susan Young, executive director of the Cleveland-based Power Tool Institute, said in a statement. Ryobi Ltd. and its U.S.-based power-tool distributor were hit with a $1.5 million personal-injury verdict in March 2010 involving the Japanese company’s failure to take a license to patent safety-tool technology. In that case, the plaintiff claimed that Hiroshima-based Ryobi knew, ever since a November 2000 meeting of a power-tool trade group, that a technology existed to detect the proximity of human flesh to a saw blade and stop the saw instantly. The jury found that Ryobi and its distributor sold a product that was defectively designed, and that plaintiff Carlos Osorio lacked full knowledge of the product’s defect and danger. Although Home Depot Inc. (HD) , which sold the saw, was also a defendant, the jury found no liability on the retailer’s part. Ryobi appealed, and the lower court ruling was upheld by an appeals court yesterday. At the time of the lower court ruling, the Oregonian newspaper reported that 60 similar cases were pending nationwide. That case was Osorio v. One World Technologies Inc., 1:06- cv-10725-NMG, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). The appeals court case is Osorio v. One World Technologies, 10-1824, U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. For more patent news, click here. Trademark EA Files Application for Two ‘Style Empire’ Trademarks for Games Electronic Arts Inc. (ERTS) , the Redwood City company known for its sports-oriented computer games such as Madden NFL , may be looking far from the sports world for its next game if a recent filing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is any indication. According to the patent office database, EA filed two applications Sept. 26 to register “Style Empire” as a trademark. The marks are for computer game software and an online computer game. The Joystiq website, which follows computer game development, speculates that the marks will be used with “a casual and/or social game” or a “new massive multiplayer rhythm dress-up motion game.” The applications were filed by Vineeta Gajwani , EA’s in- house IP counsel. Berjaya Acquired Borders Trademark Rights for Malaysia  Berjaya Corp. Bhd has acquired all rights to the Borders trademarks in Malaysia, the country’s Sun newspaper reported. The mark was acquired from the liquidators of Borders Group Inc. and was approved by the bankruptcy court in New York , according to the Sun. As a result of the acquisition, Malaysia will be the only country in Southeast Asia where Borders still operates, the newspaper reported. The rights acquired cover both Internet-based retail businesses and brick-and-mortar stores, according to the Sun. For more trademark news, click here. Copyright Copyrights for Foreign Works Scrutinized by U.S. High Court The U.S. Supreme Court grappled with a challenge to a federal law that gave new copyright protection to millions of foreign-produced books, movies and musical pieces that once were in the public domain. In an hour-long argument yesterday that touched on the work of Jimi Hendrix, Aaron Copland and William Shakespeare, the justices signaled they are divided over the constitutionality of the 1994 statute, which aimed to harmonize U.S. copyright law with rules in other countries. The measure applied to works that had been excluded from the American copyright system for various reasons. The case has implications for the U.S. film and music industries, which are urging broad copyright protection, and Google Inc., which is asking the court to ensure the availability of works that are central to its digital-book project. The court’s ruling will affect rights to works by Alfred Hitchcock, Pablo Picasso, Igor Stravinsky and C.S. Lewis, according to opponents of the law. Justice Stephen Breyer emerged as a skeptic of the law, pointing to what he said was a “treasure trove” of foreign- produced literature and music that groups are working to post on the Internet. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took the other side, saying the measure gave foreign composers like Stravinsky and Dmitri Shostakovich copyright protection for “the same limited time as Aaron Copland,” the late American composer. The 1994 law is being challenged by a group of orchestra conductors, educators, performers, film archivists and movie distributors who say they will lose access to important material. Leading the group is Lawrence Golan, a music professor at the University of Denver who sued in 2001. The group’s lawyer, Anthony Falzone, said the law “took millions of works out of the public domain, where they had been for decades.” Congress approved the law to meet obligations stemming from the so-called Uruguay Round of international trade talks. The motion-picture and music industries pushed for the provision to secure reciprocal copyright protection for American works abroad. The measure, known as Section 514, applied to foreign works that were excluded from American protection, in some cases because the U.S. didn’t have copyright relations with the author’s home country and in other cases because the U.S. hadn’t yet recognized copyrights on sound recordings. The law gave those authors the copyright protection they otherwise would have had. The Obama administration is defending the law, arguing that Congress has the constitutional power to remove works from the public domain. Donald Verrilli, making his first argument before the court since being sworn in as U.S. solicitor general, today called the law “essentially the price of admission to the international system.” The case is Golan v. Holder, 10-545. For more copyright news, click here. IP Moves Akin Gets Texas Magistrate, McDermott Litigator for IP Group Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP added two lawyers to its IP practice group, the Washington-based firm said in a statement. The two new hires are Charles Everingham IV and David M. Stein. Everingham is a former magistrate judge for the Eastern District of Texas, a popular venue for patent-infringement cases. He handled more than 75 of the hearings that determined the scope of a patent, commonly known as Markman hearings. He presided, by stipulation of the parties, over more than 200 civil cases, the majority of which were IP disputes involving complex technology. Before he was selected as magistrate judge in 2000, he served for seven years as permanent law clerk to U.S. District Judge T. John Ward of that same judicial district. He has an undergraduate degree from Stephen F. Austin State University and a law degree from Baylor University. Stein , who joins from Chicago ’s McDermott Will & Emery, is a litigator who headed his former firm’s East Texas practice group. He has represented clients in IP disputes related to semiconductor devices and processing, medical devices, sporting goods and business methods. He has an undergraduate degree from Stanford University and a law degree from Georgetown University.

Death of Jobs Leaves Hollywood Chiefs Without Trusted Silicon Valley Envoy,['Michael White' 'Ronald Grover' 'Andy Fixmer'],2011-10-07 06:30:58,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/steve-jobs-s-death-leaves-hollywood-without-trusted-silicon-valley-envoy.html,"Steve Jobs ’s death leaves Hollywood without the trusted technology envoy who helped push the film, TV and music industries into the digital age. In the 25 years after he bought George Lucas ’s digital animation business and renamed it Pixar, Jobs charmed, angered and cajoled Hollywood executives as he pursued his vision for digital entertainment. He clashed with former Walt Disney Co. (DIS) Chief Executive Officer Michael Eisner over their movie partnership, while befriending Eisner’s successor, Robert Iger. Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s co-founder relentlessly challenged the industry to change -- ushering in the age of digital animation with “Toy Story,” upending the record labels with the iPod and the iTunes store, and by negotiating to sell TV shows and films online. Disney’s ABC was the first to sign on. “Steve and I were talking for months about delivering TV shows on iTunes, which is when he shows me the video iPod, and I said, ‘We’re in!’” Iger said in e-mail. “Movies were next, a year later. It was about what we wanted to do and what we felt was right for our business.” With the 2006 sale of Pixar, Jobs became Burbank, California-based Disney’s biggest investor, with a stake worth $4.35 billion. Hollywood executives resisted putting shows online. Piracy had devastated the music industry and iTunes’ dominance of online music retailing gave Cupertino, California-based Apple unprecedented influence over the record labels. ‘Getting It’ Jobs was determined to get the studios on board, said Jim Gianopulos, co-chairman of News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox Filmed Entertainment. “He’d call up and say, ‘We’ve got to do this, this is the way to do it, and you guys aren’t getting it,’” Gianopulos said in an interview. “We would banter back and forth, but we always found ways to work together. To his great credit, he would see an aspect of the film side, the media side, that he hadn’t considered, and he would call back the next day and he would have figured out how to work that problem.” Today, iTunes is the top seller of online movies, with 66 percent of the market for electronic sales and Web video-on- demand, researcher IHS said in August. Its share of U.S. music retailing was 70 percent last year, according to NPD. “Steve understood that the only way to compete with piracy was to create a system that by its very nature is more convenient for consumers,” said Paul Vidich, a Warner Music Group Corp. (WMG) executive who negotiated the first record-label agreement with Apple. ‘Rocket Ship’ Diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer in 2003, Jobs died Oct. 5 at age 56. Gianopulos said his discussions with Jobs over film rights evolved into a personal friendship. “He would come into the meeting and say, ‘Hey, you want to see something cool?’ And he would reach into his jacket and pull out the first prototype of the iPhone,” Gianopulos said. “It was like someone had shown you the first rocket ship.” Disney, the pioneer in animation and theme parks, became a lab for Jobs. The studio served as distributor of Pixar movies starting in 1995. Later, after Jobs sold the animation studio to Disney for $8.06 billion in stock, the company became an Internet trailblazer as well -- becoming the first of its peers to offer films and TV shows on iTunes. Today former Pixar CEO Ed Catmull oversees all of Disney’s animation. John Lasseter, Pixar’s creative leader, holds a similar post at Disney with roles in films and theme parks. Clash With Eisner Relations with Disney almost foundered in 2003 in a dispute with Eisner over an extension of the Pixar deal, and on Jan. 30, 2004, Jobs announced Pixar was looking elsewhere. In nine years, the partnership had produced some of Disney’s top-grossing pictures, such as “Finding Nemo.” By that time, Eisner’s position at Disney was shaky. His pay and flagging stock angered institutional investors and Roy Disney, nephew of founder Walt and an influential shareholder. Iger was named to succeed Eisner in March 2005 and the first call was with Jobs. “He wished me well and hoped we could work together soon,” Iger said in a 2005 interview with Businessweek. In October, within two weeks of taking over, Iger agreed to sell episodes of TV shows from Disney’s ABC network on iTunes for $1.99 each. Three months later, he clinched the deal for Pixar. Pixar’s 12 movies have generated $5.73 billion in worldwide box office sales for Disney and theater operators, according to Box Office Mojo, a movie-tracking service. They’ve become theme- park attractions and a “Cars” land will open at Disney’s California Adventure next year. ‘Pretty Simple’ The entertainment industry is still grappling with how to prosper in the digital world Jobs helped create. In August, after a year-long experiment, Apple ended its 99-cent rentals of TV episodes from Fox and ABC. CBS Corp. (CBS) , owner of the most-watched U.S. TV network, and NBC didn’t participate because the price was too low. After first caving in to Jobs’s demands that all songs sell for 99 cents, the music industry last year won more control over pricing on iTunes, pushing through a 30-cent increase in the price of some tracks. Music executives credit Jobs with saving the industry from Internet piracy. “The guy had been doing serious thinking while we were all batting our heads against a wall,” Jimmy Iovine , chairman of Interscope-Geffen-A&M, said in a 2004 interview. “He was going to provide us with that great interface and we were going to give him unique content that you couldn’t get anywhere else.

Fanuc Corp., a manufacturer of industrial robots that makes 75 percent of its sales overseas, advanced 4.3 percent. Softbank Corp. (9984) jumped 6.5 percent and KDDI Corp. (9433) gained on speculation the two mobile phone carriers will avoid a price war. Sony Corp. (6758) fell 3.7 percent after Nomura Holdings Inc. cut the consumer- electronics maker’s investment rating. The Nikkei 225 rose 1 percent to 8,605.62 at the 3 p.m. trading close in Tokyo, narrowing the gauge’s weekly loss to 1.1 percent. The broader Topix index added 0.6 percent to 741.55 today after the European Central Bank took steps to ensure the region’s banks can borrow money. “It certainly sounds like policymakers in Europe are understanding the situation with the banking system,” said Belinda Allen, a senior investment analyst at Colonial First State Global Asset Management in Sydney, which oversees about $145 billion. “It looks like they are getting more willing to recapitalize the banks.” The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 1.8 percent yesterday, capping its biggest three-day rally since August, after Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said U.S. banks have become stronger. Stocks also rose after a report showed claims for U.S. unemployment benefits rose less than forecast last week. Futures on the S&P 500 lost 0.2 percent today. ECB Action European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet yesterday said the ECB will resume purchases of mortgage-backed securities and reintroduce yearlong loans for banks. In London , the Bank of England boosted its asset-purchase program by more than a third to 275 billion pounds ($425 billion). “Both the central banks are certainly willing to try to prevent market dislocation,” Colonial First State’s Allen said. “That has been positive for risk assets.” The Bank of Japan kept the benchmark overnight interest rate between zero and 0.1 percent, it said in a statement today. Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his colleagues also left unchanged the size of the bank’s lending and asset-purchase programs. Fanuc, Nissan Exporters advanced.

Mazda Motor Corp., which gets about 60 percent of its sales abroad, climbed 2.1 percent to 147 yen. Japanese banks rose on signs the European Commission is pushing for a coordinated effort to shield the region’s lenders from a potential Greek default. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.

The decline has cut the price of shares on the index to 0.9 times estimated book value, near the lowest since March 2009. Softbank, KDDI Softbank jumped 6.5 percent to 2,456 yen and KDDI rose 1.4 percent to 568,000 yen. KDDI, which will compete with Softbank in offering Apple Inc.’s iPhone in Japan , will charge 13 percent more for unlimited wireless data downloads than its smaller rival. KDDI “has started out by avoiding price competition,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report today. “This should prevent a sharp narrowing of revenue growth potential.” Sony slid 3.7 percent to 1,415 yen today after Nomura cut its rating to “neutral” from “buy,” saying the company will have difficulty cutting costs at its television business. Separately, Sony is closer to an agreement to buy Ericsson AB’s stake in their mobile-phone venture, according to a Wall Street Journal report, citing people familiar with the matter.

Apple 22-Year Veteran Cue Steers Company Into Post-PC Era Jobs Envisioned,['Peter Burrows'],2011-10-06 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/apple-s-cue-steers-company-into-post-pc-era.html,"Steve Jobs ’s vision of a post-PC era of Web-based applications is being left to Eddy Cue, the 22-year Apple Inc. (AAPL) veteran responsible for building the iTunes platform and cultivating the planned iCloud file-sharing service. Cue, who had been vice president of the Cupertino, California-based company’s Internet services business, was promoted by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook in September to senior vice president. The promotion expanded Cue’s oversight of the App Store, which sells downloadable software for iPads and iPhones, as well as the iAd mobile-ad business that competes with Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s AdMob. In his earlier roles in building iTunes music, movie and TV service, Cue handled negotiations with Hollywood studios and record companies. A gregarious man known for an easy sense of humor, Cue often has done most of the negotiations, with Jobs coming in to close when necessary, according to Tim Bajarin, founder of Campbell, California-based consulting firm Creative Strategies Inc. “He’s a key guy,” Bajarin said. “But if you didn’t know any better, you wouldn’t think so” upon meeting him, he said. The promotion reflected his role in building iTunes and the App Store , and it puts him on the same level as such Apple executives as design head Jonathan Ive and iPhone software chief Scott Forstall. “Apple is a company and culture unlike any other in the world and leaders like Eddy get that,” Cook wrote in the memo announcing the promotion. “Apple is in their blood.” Digital Life Cue was a manager in Apple’s customer support unit in 1997 when Jobs returned to the company after an ouster more than a decade earlier. Jobs put Cue in charge of one of his first efforts: to build an online store. The success of the store helped Apple sell directly to customers rather than through a less efficient network of dealers and third-party retailers. Cue later helped develop the initial iTunes store as well as the processes that would make purchasing songs or downloading apps simple and secure. One of the recent steps in the company’s evolution is iCloud, which will let users access content across multiple Apple devices without having to physically transfer files from hard drive to hard drive. Jobs proclaimed in June that iCloud would become the hub of digital life and “demote the PC and the Mac to be just another device.” To contact the reporter on this story: Peter Burrows in San Francisco at  pburrows@bloomberg.net.

Steve Jobs’s Cancer Response Should Also Be Part of Legacy: View,['the Editors'],2011-10-06 17:19:22,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/steve-jobs-s-response-to-cancer-should-also-be-a-part-of-his-legacy-view.html,"He was an inventor with more than 300 patents to his name.

He was an angry perfectionist. He was the world’s best- known corporate chief executive. He was Steve Jobs. More than any other business leader of our time, Jobs touched our souls. The computers, phones, music players, movies and software that he and his colleagues devised at Apple Inc. (AAPL) weren’t just marvelous creations in their own right. They were gateways to a future that held genuine promise. Whether we were eager fans, lining up outside convention halls to hear Jobs speak, or reluctant converts, muttering about our children’s infatuations with iPods, we couldn’t help but be swept up in the Apple founder’s vision. The tributes pouring in after Jobs’s death Wednesday speak to this extraordinary gift. Another aspect of Jobs’s time on earth, however, deserves a moment’s reflection: the way he died. His pancreatic cancer was diagnosed in 2003, when Jobs was 48. The last eight years of his life were a series of health crises, partial recoveries and dashed hopes. It would have been easy for him to turn bitter, morose or self-destructive about his fate. Yet Jobs rose to new career heights in those final years, while also gracing others with as much compassion as they had ever seen. Although Apple was at times criticized for being closed-mouthed about its leader’s health, Jobs himself faced mortality earlier and more bluntly than most. ‘Life’s Change Agent’ “No one wants to die,” Jobs observed in a 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University. Even so, he declared, “Death is very likely the single best invention of life. It’s life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.” In his final years at Apple, Jobs spearheaded bold expansions that stretched the company’s identity far beyond computers. But he also did something that most founders can’t: He gradually passed operating control of the company to one of his long-time lieutenants, Tim Cook. The notion of Apple without Jobs -- which once must have seemed like a catastrophe to customers, employees and investors -- is being absorbed with sadness but also with calm. The lesson -- one that was reinforced if you spent time with Jobs and could see a failing body attached to a vibrant, powerful mind -- is that ideas live on. Hardware gives out; software keeps running. “Stay hungry, stay foolish,” Jobs declared at the end of his 2005 Stanford talk. In reality, Jobs was hardly ever foolish, though he didn’t mind if other people thought he was. But he remained hungry and in pursuit -- of seismic ideas, seamless execution and excellence in all its forms.

STMicroelectronics Said to Cool on Splitup Amid Discord,['Matthew Campbell'],2012-11-16 18:34:11,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/stmicroelectronics-said-to-cool-on-splitup-amid-discord.html,"STMicroelectronics NV (STM) , Europe ’s largest semiconductor maker, will probably decide against splitting itself into two units after disagreements between French and Italian executives over the breakup proposal, according to people familiar with the situation. The split under consideration between analog and digital businesses hasn’t won the full support of STMicroelectronics’ board, and will probably be shelved in favor of smaller asset sales, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing private deliberations. French executives including Chairman Didier Lombard and Chief Operating Officer Didier Lamouche had failed to convince the chipmaker’s Italian chief executive officer, Carlo Bozotti , to support the plan, they said. Strategy chief Philippe Lambinet, who left the Geneva-based company in September, was a key supporter of a split, the people said. Lacking a unified management position, the company would struggle to convince the French and Italian governments, which together control 27.5 percent of its shares, to back such a dramatic overhaul, one of the people said. STMicroelectronics reiterated in a statement yesterday that it has no plans to divide the company. “Such a project has never been presented to the ST supervisory board,” STMicroelectronics said. “There is full alignment between the management of the company and the supervisory board of directors.” Shares Fall STMicroelectronics fell 2.3 percent today in Paris to 4.23 euros. On Oct. 12, the French shares rose as much as 19 percent, the biggest intraday gain since it started trading in 1994, after Bloomberg News reported the breakup evaluation. The semiconductor manufacturer has been dragged down by its digital business, which manufactures chips for handsets and set- top boxes, as key customers like Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) and BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) see their own sales decline. More broadly, European semiconductor makers have struggled to cope with the industry’s sharp price and demand swings. They are losing market share to Asian and U.S. competitors who have switched to so-called fabless models, dispensing with factories in favor of outsourcing to foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330) That allows semiconductor makers to adjust their designs and production more quickly without the overhead of running their own plants. Industry Shrinks The global semiconductor industry will shrink 2 percent in 2012, researcher Exane said in September, after previously predicting an increase of 1 percent. Rather than splitting the company, STMicroelectronics may seek gradual, closer integration with South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , which already manufactures some advanced chips on its behalf, one of the people said. Nam Ki Yung, a Seoul-based spokesman for Samsung, declined to comment. The South Korean firm has spent more than $1.4 billion on deals this year to bolster access to technology and materials for phones and tablets, including a $310 million July deal for the wireless unit of British semiconductor manufacturer CSR Plc.

"Microsoft’s Ballmer Says Company Must Combine Hardware, Software",['Aaron Ricadela'],2012-11-15 09:34:30,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/microsoft-s-ballmer-says-company-must-combine-hardware-software.html,"Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said the maker of Windows programs must exploit the opportunity to combine hardware and software as it challenges Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad with the Surface tablet computer. Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker , won’t cede that market to competitors even as partners build the “lion’s share” of devices using Windows in the next five years, Ballmer said yesterday during an address at the Churchill Club speaker series in Santa Clara , California. The company recognizes “there’s an innovation opportunity” by collaborating across hardware and software, he said. Microsoft is undertaking an overhaul of its product line meant to keep it relevant in the post-PC era. The company dominated the technology landscape during the heyday of the personal computer in the 1990s and much of the last decade, yet has been eclipsed in influence by a resurgent Apple and the rise of mobile devices taking the place of PCs that run Microsoft’s flagship Windows operating system. “We really reimagined Windows,” he said at the on-stage discussion with Reid Hoffman , the chairman and co-founder of the online business network LinkedIn Corp. “The distinction between a PC and a tablet I think, at least in our ecosystem, completely goes away.” Sinofsky Departure Microsoft pushed out Windows division chief Steven Sinofsky this week as Ballmer pushes for more cross-product coordination to fight back against Apple and other mobile-device makers, people with knowledge of the matter said. Ballmer is putting in place a new team to start work on the next generation of products after the release of Windows 8, the Surface and mobile- phone software last month. Sinofsky’s duties were reassigned to Julie Larson-Green, who will take charge of all software and hardware for Windows, and Tami Reller, who adds oversight of the Windows business to her marketing and finance responsibilities. “The new team is fantastic,” Ballmer said. On the Web, Google Inc. (GOOG) has made its pages hubs for many of Internet users’ activities, and its Android operating system powers many of the world’s mobile phones and tablet computers, markets Microsoft has tried for years to penetrate. Ballmer, 56, is trying to adapt in a computer industry landscape vastly changed from when he took over as CEO from co-founder Bill Gates in 2000. HP, Dell In response to shifting trends, the Redmond, Washington- based company last month released Windows 8 -- the biggest change to its flagship product in nearly two decades -- designed around a revamped home screen featuring colorful tiles that launch programs and update users with current information from the Internet. “With technology companies, you either move forward or you die,” Ballmer said. On Oct. 26, the same day Windows 8 went on sale, Microsoft started selling Surface, its first foray into the computer market. The tablet, featuring attachable keyboards that double as covers, was designed by Microsoft and runs Windows RT, a special version for chips from ARM Holdings Plc -- and a break from the company’s traditional PC partners Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , Dell Inc. (DELL) and Intel Corp. (INTC)  ‘Seminal Moment’ Ballmer said in an Oct. 25 interview with Bloomberg TV’s Cory Johnson that the release of Windows 8 and Surface is one of “three seminal moments” in his 32-year Microsoft career, standing alongside releasing Windows 95 and the advent of International Business Machines Corp.’s first PC in 1981. Microsoft is relying on the new operating system to revive interest in the personal computer. The PC market will contract by 1.2 percent to 348.7 million units this year, according to IHS ISuppli. That would be the first annual decline since 2001. “Surface is a best-in-class product” and sets a high bar for PC makers to clear, said Rick Sherlund , an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York. Sherlund, who recommends buying Microsoft shares, estimates the company can sell 2 million Surface computers in the fourth quarter. Shares of Microsoft have underperformed the broader stock market the past five years, losing 21 percent of their value compared with a 6.6 percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and an 11 percent gain for the S&P 500 Information Technology Index. Fiscal first-quarter sales for the period ended in September fell 8 percent as sales of Windows and Office both declined. ‘Wild’ Android Apple’s Macs, iPads and iPhones are replacing many of the jobs once done by Windows machines, and Apple has supplanted Microsoft as the center of gravity for outside software developers whose products make each platform more compelling. Apple said Nov. 5 it sold 3 million fourth-generation iPads and iPad mini models during their debut weekend. Smartphone versions of Windows held just 2 percent of the market in the third quarter, dwarfed by the 75 percent share of Google’s Android and 14.9 percent for Apple’s iOS. Microsoft is making plans for the possible creation of its own smartphone, according to people with knowledge of the company’s plans. The company on Oct. 29 introduced the latest version of its Windows Phone software that relies on the same underlying code as desktop and tablet Windows. Microsoft, which has single-digit market share in smartphones, wants to get 10 percent to 15 percent share as its next step, Ballmer said. Windows-based smartphones have an opportunity to stand out because “all these phones look the darned same,” he said. Ballmer said there’s an opportunity for Windows on smartphones and tablets since Android is “wild” and the iOS ecosystem is “controlled” and high-priced.

The tablet, featuring attachable keyboards that double as covers, was designed by Microsoft and runs Windows RT, a special version for chips from ARM Holdings Plc -- and a break from the company’s traditional PC partners Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , Dell Inc. (DELL) and Intel Corp. (INTC)  ‘Seminal Moment’ Ballmer said in an Oct. 25 interview with Bloomberg TV’s Cory Johnson that the release of Windows 8 and Surface is one of “three seminal moments” in his 32-year Microsoft career, standing alongside releasing Windows 95 and the advent of International Business Machines Corp.’s first PC in 1981. Microsoft is relying on the new operating system to revive interest in the personal computer. The PC market will contract by 1.2 percent to 348.7 million units this year, according to IHS ISuppli. That would be the first annual decline since 2001. “Surface is a best-in-class product” and sets a high bar for PC makers to clear, said Rick Sherlund , an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York. Sherlund, who recommends buying Microsoft shares, estimates the company can sell 2 million Surface computers in the fourth quarter. Shares of Microsoft have underperformed the broader stock market the past five years, losing 21 percent of their value compared with a 6.6 percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and an 11 percent gain for the S&P 500 Information Technology Index. Fiscal first-quarter sales for the period ended in September fell 8 percent as sales of Windows and Office both declined. ‘Wild’ Android Apple’s Macs, iPads and iPhones are replacing many of the jobs once done by Windows machines, and Apple has supplanted Microsoft as the center of gravity for outside software developers whose products make each platform more compelling. Apple said Nov. 5 it sold 3 million fourth-generation iPads and iPad mini models during their debut weekend. Smartphone versions of Windows held just 2 percent of the market in the third quarter, dwarfed by the 75 percent share of Google’s Android and 14.9 percent for Apple’s iOS. Microsoft is making plans for the possible creation of its own smartphone, according to people with knowledge of the company’s plans. The company on Oct. 29 introduced the latest version of its Windows Phone software that relies on the same underlying code as desktop and tablet Windows. Microsoft, which has single-digit market share in smartphones, wants to get 10 percent to 15 percent share as its next step, Ballmer said. Windows-based smartphones have an opportunity to stand out because “all these phones look the darned same,” he said. Ballmer said there’s an opportunity for Windows on smartphones and tablets since Android is “wild” and the iOS ecosystem is “controlled” and high-priced.

"Neil Young Raises $500,000 for Pono Online Music Format",['Miles Weiss'],2012-11-15 05:01:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/neil-young-raises-500-000-for-pono-online-music-format.html,"Neil Young , the rock singer who said he was prepared to brave “treacherous” venture capital markets to popularize his high-fidelity format for downloading music, raised $500,000 from an investment group last month. Ivanhoe Inc., a Santa Monica , California-based company that lists Young as chief executive officer, got the money from 12 investors, according to an Oct. 29 regulatory filing. Young got clearance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office in July to use the term Ivanhoe in connection with online music distribution. The musician, a two-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame who co-founded the band Buffalo Springfield and played in Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young before going solo, plans to roll out an audio system called Pono as a higher-quality alternative to digital formats such as MP3. Young, writing in a new memoir that he has “big ideas and very little money to show for them,” said he would finance Pono by turning to investment firms that typically back technology startups. “All I have to do now is navigate the waters of venture capitalism, those treacherous shorelines of commerce, in the HMS Pono,” Young wrote in “Waging Heavy Peace” ( Blue Rider Press , 512 pages, $30), published in September by an imprint of Penguin Group (USA) Inc. “I can’t tell you how scary this is,” Young added, saying he has never been “on this vessel, in these waters, with the cargo on board.” Last month’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission didn’t identify the investors or disclose whether the money came from friends and family, venture capital firms or angel investors. Jobs, Ford Venture firms are professional money managers who invest on behalf of outside clients, typically committing $1 million or more to each company they fund, according to the National Venture Capital Association in Arlington, Virginia. Angel backers, the association says on its website, use their own money to provide seed capital to technology startups, and generally invest less than $1 million in any one company. Young, who turned 67 this week, has decried the impact of music downloading and streaming services such as Apple’s iTunes and Spotify Ltd. on listening quality, writing in his memoir that he is “trying like hell to rescue recorded sound so people can feel music again.” In the book, he described speaking with industry leaders such as Steve Jobs , the late co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc. (AAPL) , and William Ford , the chairman of Ford Motor Co. (F) , as he sought to advance Pono as an alternative to MP3. ‘New Format’ “As far as a whole new format, I’m not aware of anybody doing what Neil is trying to do,” said Michael McGuire, media industry analyst at Gartner Inc., a Stamford , Connecticut, provider of research on high-tech industries. Ivanhoe, incorporated in December in Delaware , is the vehicle Young is using to bring his technology to market, according to Mark Goldstein, who said he served as the company’s CEO for about six months and is now an adviser. Elliot Roberts, the record executive who has served as Young’s manager for decades, is listed as an Ivanhoe director in last month’s SEC filing. Another director, according to the filing, is Gisele “Gigi” Brisson, the co-founder of Attractor Investment Management Inc., a Seattle-based money manager that makes angel investments in high-tech startups. “It’s actually a little early for us to give any information,” Roberts, the head of Lookout Management in Santa Monica, said in a brief telephone interview. “When we can comment, we’ll be an open spigot.” Roberts said he was speaking on behalf of Young, who couldn’t be reached for comment. Brisson didn’t return telephone calls seeking comment. Venture Capital Attractor runs three partnerships that invest in the equities of technology companies and had about $185 million in client assets under management at the end of August, according to a Sept. 12 company brochure that was filed with the SEC. Companies getting venture capital for the first time raised an average of $3.6 million last year through the third quarter, according to the MoneyTree Report compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association. Goldstein, described in “Waging Heavy Peace” as a Pono CEO “candidate,” said Young’s trepidation about venture capital may stem from unfamiliarity with the industry. Young “is not a spring chicken and this is something that is new and different,” Goldstein said in a telephone interview. “Not much scares him.” ‘Lossless Technologies’ MP3 is known as a “lossy” format because it compresses digitized sound by stripping out portions inaudible to the average listener, making it easier and faster to download the music and possible to hold more titles on portable players and mobile phones. With the price of computer memory declining and the availability of broadband Internet service growing, the need to compress files has diminished, paving the way for the use of “lossless” formats such as Pono that retain all of the digitized sounds. “It’s sort of a growing trend among audiophiles who for a while were in despair that kids were listening to these low- resolution sound files,” said Ralph Graves, the editor of a blog for Crutchfield, an online consumer-electronics retailer based in Charlottesville, Virginia. “Now there are all kinds of technologies that are moving toward lossless audio formats so you don’t have to make bad compromises with the sound.” In applying at the U.S. Patent Office to trademark the word Ivanhoe, Young said he planned to use the term in connection with the provision of “online and retail store services” featuring high-resolution music downloadable from the Internet and “discs featuring music and video of music and artistic performances.” ‘Neat Idea’ In July, the U.S. patent office issued a notice of allowance stating there had been no opposition to Young’s application. He must now file documents detailing how he plans to use the trademarks, and has as long as three years to put them to use, said James Powers, the founder of Data Rights & Privacy Advisors LLC, a Reston, Virginia-based firm that consults on intellectual property, privacy and data issues. “He has a neat idea,” Powers, a former patent and trademark attorney, said of Young’s venture, which is designed to provide music lovers with the same level of quality produced in recording studios. “The demand for greater sound quality is absolutely there,” Powers said in a telephone interview. Young decided to brand his concept Pono, which he says is Hawaiian for “righteous and good,” after discovering that his original choice, PureTone, was already in use, according to the singer’s memoir. Warner Music Group, the parent company for Young’s record label, has agreed to make its catalog of songs available on Pono, the New York Times reported in September.

GameStop Plans to Close 200 Money-Losing Outlets,['Cliff Edwards'],2012-11-15 21:08:02,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/gamestop-plans-to-close-200-money-losing-u-s-outlets.html,"GameStop Corp. (GME) the world’s largest video-game retailer, plans to close 200 stores by next year, saying about 3 percent of its outlets worldwide lose money. The closings, announced on a conference call, follow the Grapevine, Texas-based company’s report today of better-than- expected third-quarter results, excluding an impairment charge. The company also forecast fourth-quarter profit that was in line with analysts’ estimates. GameStop is showing “strong resilience in the face of challenging category headwinds, and the new categories of digital and mobile are creating new profit pools that we are exploiting aggressively,” Chief Executive Officer J. Paul Raines said today on a conference call. The retailer heads into the U.S. holidays weighed down by a two-year industry slump as players gravitate to mobile and online play from console-based games. Raines said the company managed to expand margins in a “tough video game market” by expanding into the re-sale of Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPads and other mobile devices and growing its digital download business. GameStop rose 4.3 percent to $24.50 in New York. The stock has gained 1.5 percent this year. The company operates 6,650 stores worldwide. Nintendo Wii Investors are weighing whether this month’s release of Nintendo Co.’s Wii U, the industry’s first new home console in six years, will spur purchases or confirm declining interest in packaged games. GameStop said 500,000 customers worldwide had placed their names on a waiting list for the device, which goes on sale Nov. 18 in the U.S. The retailer on its conference call helped alleviate fears that it would report a larger-than-expected number of money- losing stores, said Arvind Bhatia , an analyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc. in Dallas. The majority of GameStop’s losses came from Australian and Canadian acquisitions that underperformed, he said. “They’re cleaning out the portfolio,” said Bhatia, who rates the shares buy. “Having only 3 percent of your stores losing money generally is a fairly healthy number for a retailer.” For the fourth quarter, the retailer’s peak earnings period, profit is expected to be $2.07 to $2.27 a share, GameStop said in the statement. The midpoint of $2.17 is 1 cent above the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales from existing stores may range from a decline of 7 percent to a gain of 1 percent, the company said. Quarterly Loss For the third quarter ended Oct. 27, GameStop posted a net loss of $624.3 million, or $5.08 a share, after impairment and goodwill costs of $678.8 million, mostly tied to international operations. That compared with net income of $53.9 million, or 39 cents, a year earlier. Excluding the impairment expenses, earnings of 38 cents topped the 33-cent average of estimates. Sales declined 8.9 percent to $1.77 billion, compared with projections of $1.79 billion. International operations accounted for about 32 percent of revenue last year. The video-game industry is entering the U.S. holiday season amid an extended drop in sales. Existing consoles, which include Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox 360 and Sony Corp.’s PlayStation 3, are aging, while mobile and online options attract players. Last year, the fourth quarter accounted for 51 percent of GameStop’s annual profit. The company said on Oct. 26 it will open about 80 GameStop Kids stores featuring products including toys and collectibles for children under age 13 in time for holiday shopping.

Apple Products Stolen From Lufthansa Heist Site at JFK,['Chris Dolmetsch'],2012-11-16 01:57:22,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/apple-products-stolen-from-lufthansa-heist-site-at-jfk.html,"More than $1.5 million worth of Apple Inc. (AAPL) products were stolen from a cargo building at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport that was the site of a 1978 heist memorialized in the movie “Goodfellas.” Investigators at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, suspect that the theft was an inside job and are pursuing leads, Ron Marsico, a spokesman for the agency, said today in an interview. The building where the crime took place, Building 261, was the location of the 1978 Lufthansa heist that was documented in the 1990 Martin Scorsese film “Goodfellas,” Marsico said. The crime was reported earlier today by the New York Post, The thieves used one of the airport’s forklifts to load two pallets of IPad minis, or about 3,600 of the devices, into a truck, the newspaper said, citing unidentified people in law enforcement. The thieves arrived at the building at about 11 p.m. in a white tractor-trailer on the side of the building that faces the street and has less security than the other side, which is next to the tarmac, the newspaper said, citing the people. The stolen items had arrived from China and were to be shipped throughout the U.S. by a company called Cargo Airport Services, the Post reported. The thieves left behind three pallets of products after an airport worker returning from dinner challenged them, the newspaper said. Phil Jensen, director of sales and marketing for Cargo Airport Services, declined to comment on the theft in a telephone interview, citing a pending investigation.

"Citigroup’s Stock Lured Bacon, Ainslie as Pandit Exit Loomed",['Dakin Campbell'],2012-11-15 16:00:31,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/bacon-joined-ainslie-in-buying-citigroup-as-pandit-exit-loomed.html,"Moore Capital Management LP and Maverick Capital Management LP bought Citigroup Inc. (C) shares as the bank’s board grew dissatisfied with Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit ’s performance, eventually ousting him. Moore Capital, the hedge fund run by billionaire Louis Moore Bacon, bought 5.31 million shares in the quarter ended Sept. 30, making the lender its biggest U.S. publicly listed holding, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing yesterday. Maverick, the $10 billion firm run by Lee Ainslie , purchased 2.72 million shares of the New York-based bank, according to a filing. The filings show investors placed bets on Citigroup even as the board’s confidence in Pandit was waning. The firm said Oct. 16 that Michael Corbat replaced Pandit and will review the bank’s businesses before making more management changes. “There are a lot of pieces to this puzzle that can create value if you have the right management,” said William B. Smith, CEO of hedge fund Smith Asset Management, which owns shares of the bank. “Citigroup is a bloated bureaucracy; radical things still need to get done.” Citigroup advanced 1.5 percent to $35.55 at 10:34 a.m. in New York. The shares have fallen 3.2 percent since Pandit’s departure and plunged 89 percent during his five years as CEO. Shannon Bell , a Citigroup spokeswoman, declined to comment on the stock-ownership changes. Caused Setbacks Corbat, 52, takes over a strategy of cutting jobs and disposing of unwanted assets, including a minority stake in Smith Barney. He’ll seek to return more capital to shareholders after the Federal Reserve blocked the bank’s proposal in March, and sustain a turnaround at a company that incurred almost $30 billion in losses during the depths of the financial crisis. The board ousted Pandit after concluding his handling of operations caused setbacks with regulators and cost credibility with investors, a person with knowledge of the discussions said at the time of his departure. Directors had contemplated replacing Pandit for months as they became increasingly frustrated with his performance, the person said. Citigroup posted third-quarter profit of $468 million, or 15 cents a share, after analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a loss. The stock surged 19 percent in the period, the best performance in the KBW Bank Index of 24 U.S. lenders. Tepper, Soros Maverick increased its Citigroup stake to 5.01 million shares in the third quarter as Moore Capital , which oversees $13.5 billion in assets, acquired its entire holding during the period. Boston-based Adage Capital Management LP purchased 3.62 million shares, and Glenview Capital Management LLC bought 2.71 million, according to filings yesterday from those firms. The four hedge funds combined added 14.4 million Citigroup shares, valued at $470 million as of Sept. 30 and representing about 0.5 percent of the company’s shares outstanding. Other funds that added to their stakes include David Tepper ’s Appaloosa Management LP, which bought almost 929,000 Citigroup shares and Soros Fund Management LLC, led by billionaire George Soros , which added 1.52 million. Citigroup is Appaloosa’s third-largest holding by market value after Powershares QQQ Trust, which tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100 Index, and Cupertino, California-based Apple Inc. (AAPL) , according to a filing. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management LP exited its Citigroup position by selling 1.1 million shares. ‘Momentum Trade’ Hedge funds purchased shares of other big U.S. banks during the quarter, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  Odey Asset Management LLP, the London-based hedge fund founded by Crispin Odey , bought 621,000 shares of JPMorgan, making the New York-based bank its largest holding, according to a filing. Odey counted Citigroup as its third-largest holding even after selling 813,000 shares. Citigroup was Moore Capital’s largest investment at the end of September and JPMorgan was its second-biggest. The hedge fund also bought a stake in San Francisco-based Wells Fargo by purchasing 1.97 million shares and added 5.15 million shares to its holding in Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America. “A lot of it is the pure financial-sector momentum trade,” Smith said.

(C) shares as the bank’s board grew dissatisfied with Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit ’s performance, eventually ousting him. Moore Capital, the hedge fund run by billionaire Louis Moore Bacon, bought 5.31 million shares in the quarter ended Sept. 30, making the lender its biggest U.S. publicly listed holding, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing yesterday. Maverick, the $10 billion firm run by Lee Ainslie , purchased 2.72 million shares of the New York-based bank, according to a filing. The filings show investors placed bets on Citigroup even as the board’s confidence in Pandit was waning. The firm said Oct. 16 that Michael Corbat replaced Pandit and will review the bank’s businesses before making more management changes. “There are a lot of pieces to this puzzle that can create value if you have the right management,” said William B. Smith, CEO of hedge fund Smith Asset Management, which owns shares of the bank. “Citigroup is a bloated bureaucracy; radical things still need to get done.” Citigroup advanced 1.5 percent to $35.55 at 10:34 a.m. in New York. The shares have fallen 3.2 percent since Pandit’s departure and plunged 89 percent during his five years as CEO. Shannon Bell , a Citigroup spokeswoman, declined to comment on the stock-ownership changes. Caused Setbacks Corbat, 52, takes over a strategy of cutting jobs and disposing of unwanted assets, including a minority stake in Smith Barney. He’ll seek to return more capital to shareholders after the Federal Reserve blocked the bank’s proposal in March, and sustain a turnaround at a company that incurred almost $30 billion in losses during the depths of the financial crisis. The board ousted Pandit after concluding his handling of operations caused setbacks with regulators and cost credibility with investors, a person with knowledge of the discussions said at the time of his departure. Directors had contemplated replacing Pandit for months as they became increasingly frustrated with his performance, the person said. Citigroup posted third-quarter profit of $468 million, or 15 cents a share, after analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a loss. The stock surged 19 percent in the period, the best performance in the KBW Bank Index of 24 U.S. lenders. Tepper, Soros Maverick increased its Citigroup stake to 5.01 million shares in the third quarter as Moore Capital , which oversees $13.5 billion in assets, acquired its entire holding during the period. Boston-based Adage Capital Management LP purchased 3.62 million shares, and Glenview Capital Management LLC bought 2.71 million, according to filings yesterday from those firms. The four hedge funds combined added 14.4 million Citigroup shares, valued at $470 million as of Sept. 30 and representing about 0.5 percent of the company’s shares outstanding. Other funds that added to their stakes include David Tepper ’s Appaloosa Management LP, which bought almost 929,000 Citigroup shares and Soros Fund Management LLC, led by billionaire George Soros , which added 1.52 million. Citigroup is Appaloosa’s third-largest holding by market value after Powershares QQQ Trust, which tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100 Index, and Cupertino, California-based Apple Inc. (AAPL) , according to a filing. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management LP exited its Citigroup position by selling 1.1 million shares. ‘Momentum Trade’ Hedge funds purchased shares of other big U.S. banks during the quarter, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  Odey Asset Management LLP, the London-based hedge fund founded by Crispin Odey , bought 621,000 shares of JPMorgan, making the New York-based bank its largest holding, according to a filing. Odey counted Citigroup as its third-largest holding even after selling 813,000 shares. Citigroup was Moore Capital’s largest investment at the end of September and JPMorgan was its second-biggest. The hedge fund also bought a stake in San Francisco-based Wells Fargo by purchasing 1.97 million shares and added 5.15 million shares to its holding in Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America. “A lot of it is the pure financial-sector momentum trade,” Smith said. For large hedge funds, “the nice thing about the banks, at least the big boys, is there is liquidity. They can get in and get out pretty easily,” he said.

Sony’s Debt Risk Falls as Convertible Bond Wards off Junk Threat,['Yusuke Miyazawa'],2012-11-15 06:44:28,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/sony-s-debt-risk-falls-to-two-month-low-on-convertible-bond-sale.html,"Sony Corp. (6758) ’s credit risk declined to the lowest in almost two months on speculation the Japanese electronics maker’s sale of convertible bonds will help it avoid more debt rating cuts. The cost to insure the bonds of Sony for five years against non-payment dropped 32.6 basis points to 389 basis points as of 14:48 p.m. in Tokyo, according to intra-day prices from data provider CMA. That’s set for the lowest closing level since Sept. 19, CMA prices in New York show. Sony, reeling from four straight annual losses, has been downgraded by six levels to Baa3, the lowest investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service as the maker of Walkman music players struggles without a product to challenge Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. The company sold 150 billion yen ($1.87 billion) of debt as Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai reduces 10,000 jobs and sells assets to focus on mobile devices, games and digital imaging to revive the company. “This should be better than selling straight bonds that are 100 percent debt,” said Mana Nakazora , Tokyo-based chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas SA. “If they had chosen straight bonds, the cost could have been much higher, and that would have been negative for ratings.” The company offered the convertible bonds instead of straight debt to minimize interest payments with a zero coupon, Mami Imada , a spokeswoman for Tokyo-based Sony said today. Funding Acquisitions Sony sold the securities due November 2017 to fund acquisitions and the expansion of imaging-sensor facilities, the company said in a statement yesterday. The conversion price was set at 957 yen, or 10 percent above the closing price of its stock yesterday in Tokyo. The shares dropped as much as 11 percent to 772 yen today, and closed at 793 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The company’s first sale of such debt since 2003 “enables us to raise a significant amount of long-term money at once,” Imada said. She declined to comment on the credit-default swaps, citing Sony’s policy not to speak on market movements. The extra yield investors demand to own Sony’s 45 billion yen of 0.664 percent bonds due March 2017 rather than government debt fell half a basis point yesterday to 154, according to JS Price data. The notes were priced in March at a spread of 36 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sony’s rating has been lowered from Aa3 in 2003 by Moody’s. Sharp, Panasonic Sharp Corp. (6753) and Panasonic Corp. (6752) also expect to lose a combined 1.2 trillion yen in the fiscal year ending March, as competition from abroad and the yen near a postwar high erodes the value of their overseas earnings. “Selling 150 billion yen of convertible bonds reminds us of what’s going on with Sharp, which is facing repayment of 200 billion yen of convertibles,” BNP Paribas’ Nakazora said. Sharp’s equity-linked debt comes due in September 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “In this regard, Sony paid attention to the deterioration of their balance sheet,” BNP Paribas’ Nakazora said. “To see whether this financing is good or not, we need to see the impact on their revenues.” To contact the reporter on this story: Yusuke Miyazawa in Tokyo at  ymiyazawa3@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Shelley Smith at  ssmith118@bloomberg.net",['Yusuke Miyazawa'],"Sony’s Debt Risk Falls as Convertible Bond Wards off Junk Threat Sony Corp.

Dell Drops to Three-Year Low as Forecast Misses Estimates,['Aaron Ricadela'],2012-11-16 21:48:29,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/dell-s-sales-forecast-misses-estimates-amid-pc-industry-slump.html,"Dell Inc. (DELL) tumbled to the lowest price in more than three years after forecasting a fourth straight quarter of declining sales, a sign that a slump in demand for personal computers will persist. The stock dropped 7.3 percent to $8.86 in New York , for the lowest close since March 10, 2009. Fiscal fourth-quarter revenue will be $14 billion to $14.4 billion, the Round Rock , Texas- based company indicated in a statement yesterday. That’s less than the $14.5 billion average estimate of analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue was $16 billion a year earlier. Dell, the No. 3 PC maker, is struggling as companies wait to upgrade machines and consumers turn to smartphones and tablets like Apple Inc.’s iPad and iPhone. Even as Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell works to mitigate the decline by adding storage, networking gear, software and services through acquisitions, the company still gets half its sales from PCs, and it won’t quickly get relief from the release of a new version of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows operating system. “They’ve been talking about changing the last five years,” said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., who has a neutral rating on the shares. “They’re in a very tough position, plain and simple.” Dell has lost 39 percent this year, compared with a 7.5 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Information Technology Index. PCs Languish PC shipments tumbled 8.3 percent in the calendar third quarter from a year earlier, according to market researcher Gartner Inc., and are projected to decline this year for the first time since 2001, according to IHS iSuppli. Dell has spent more than $12.7 billion on 18 acquisitions since 2009, adding corporate data center products to lessen its reliance on PCs. Today, the company said it bought software maker Gale Technologies for an undisclosed sum, adding tools to help companies expand in cloud-computing. Sales in Dell’s fiscal third quarter, which ended Nov. 2, fell 11 percent to $13.7 billion, less than analysts’ average estimate of $13.9 billion. Fourth-quarter revenue will rise 2 percent to 5 percent from the prior period, the company said in the statement. Third-quarter profit before some items fell to 39 cents a share, compared with analysts’ average 40-cent estimate. Net income dropped 47 percent to $475 million, or 27 cents a share, from $893 million, or 49 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Desktop and laptop PC revenue declined 19 percent to $6.65 billion. Servers, Networking Sales of Dell’s servers and networking gear fared better. Revenue in that product group rose 11 percent from a year ago to $2.32 billion, buoyed by strong demand for Dell’s PowerEdge servers, new machines that have the ability to attach to faster network connections, Chief Financial Officer Brian Gladden said on a conference call with analysts. Sales of servers designed for large cloud-computing applications rose 126 percent from a year earlier, CEO Dell said on the call. In the PC market, Dell’s touch-screen tablet computers running Windows 8 -- Microsoft’s new version of its flagship PC operating system tailored for tablets and touch-screen PCs -- have been another bright spot, Gladden said in an interview. “There are some parts of the business that are actually doing well,” he said. Windows 8 Still, Windows 8 hasn’t yet provided a boost for PC makers since its introduction last month, in part because corporate customers aren’t rushing to upgrade. Gladden said Windows 8 won’t affect Dell’s results in the next two quarters. “The client business continues to be challenging,” he said. “Commercial customers tend to be lagging adopters of a new operating system. They’re going to wait.” In addition, Microsoft released its first computer -- a tablet called Surface that can function like a laptop -- putting the software company in competition with PC makers such as Dell. “The threat right now is minimal, but that’s only because the unit number is small,” said Richard Shim , an analyst at market researcher NPD DisplaySearch. “But when you look at the potential for it to disrupt partners, it’s pretty big.” On top of the stagnating PC market, superstorm Sandy may have pared $500 million to $700 million from Dell’s third- quarter revenue, according to a Nov. 8 research note from Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA who has a neutral rating on Dell shares. The storm struck the East Coast in late October, closed U.S. stock markets for two days, and may have caused as much as $20 billion in economic damage and losses. Brian White , an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets in New York, wrote yesterday in a note to clients that Dell’s operating profit, which declined 31 percent in the third quarter, may have “bottomed,” auguring well for its stock price. “The stock has limited downside from current levels as we expect value investors will be attracted,” wrote White, who recommends buying the shares.

(EKDKQ) won more time to negotiate and propose a reorganization plan that would allow the 132-year-old photography pioneer to exit bankruptcy. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper yesterday extended until Feb. 28 Kodak’s exclusive control of its Chapter 11 case, rejecting a request by a group of creditors to let other parties submit reorganization plans. Kodak, based in Rochester, New York, plans to sell a portfolio of patents and some money-losing businesses and exit bankruptcy by mid-2013. The company has said it will build a profitable business around its commercial printing division. Kodak has proposed borrowing $793 million to operate while under court protection and to fund its exit from bankruptcy. Centerbridge Capital Partners, GSO Capital Partners, UBS AG (UBSN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) are among second-lien creditors participating in the financing, Kodak said Nov 12. The agreement requires court approval. Funding is conditional on selling the patent portfolio for at least $500 million, progress in the sale of two business units and the resolution of the company’s U.K. pension obligations, Kodak said. Another group of second-lien creditors opposed giving Kodak more time to file a reorganization plan and expects to oppose the financing as well, Michael Stamer, an attorney for the creditors, told Gropper yesterday. The group is concerned that another group of lenders won’t have a chance to offer a competing loan package, Stamer said. Kodak Chief Executive Officer Antonio Perez has been selling businesses to help fund a turnaround after seeking Chapter 11 protection in January. The case is In re Eastman Kodak Co., 12-10202, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ). AstraZeneca Responds to Adverse Seroquel Patent Ruling AstraZeneca Plc is “disappointed” with a court ruling invalidating a patent for a drug used to treat bipolar disorder, the company said in a statement Nov. 13. The London-based pharmaceutical company was responding to a ruling by the Federal Patent Court in Germany that found the formulation patent for Seroquel XR (quitiapine fumarate) prolonged-release tablets to be invalid. The patent had been challenged by Teva Deustschland GmbH, Hexal AG and Accord Healthcare Ltd., AstraZeneca said. The ruling is limited to Germany and isn’t binding in other countries. London-based AstraZeneca said it sold $82 million worth of Seroquel XR in Germany for the first 10 months of 2012. For more patent news, click here. Trademarks Rosneft Claims Siberian Gas Station Chain Infringes Mark Rosneft OAO (ROSN) , Russia ’s state-owned energy company, claims its trademarks are being infringed by a chain of gas stations in Siberia, the Moscow Times reported. The case is being pursued as a criminal matter, in addition to a civil dispute involving an estimated 784 million rubles ($24.7 million), according to the newspaper. The chain, based in Novokuznetsk and not named by the newspaper, is accused of using a logo similar to Rosneft’s. Police investigators told the Times the Siberian company’s logo was so similar to the state-owned company’s “that they are almost identical.” Texas A&M Player Manziel Seeks ‘Johnny Football’ Trademark Johnny Manziel is trying to trademark the term “Johnny Football,” even as National Collegiate Athletic Association rules prevent the Texas A&M quarterback or his family from profiting from the mark while he’s a college athlete. The Manziel family is working in conjunction with the university to protect the trademark, the player’s likeness and the freshman’s eligibility, said Shane Hinckley, assistant vice president of business development at the College Station, Texas- based school. Jay Jordan of the Tyler, Texas, law firm of J. Bennett White is representing the family. He said in a telephone interview that he couldn’t discuss legal or other strategies. “We’re exploring every avenue and believe several are open to us with regard to protection of ‘Johnny Football,’” he said. Jordan wouldn’t say whether the family planned to use the mark commercially or apply for extensions once their ownership of the mark is granted by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. Kenneth R. Reynolds Family Investments of College Station, Texas, filed a “Johnny Football” trademark application with the federal agency on Nov. 1. Jordan said the party is unrelated to the Manziel family and that the application would be opposed. “Efforts are ongoing to eradicate those who seek to pirate the mark,” he said, declining to say whether Manziel has had talks with the university about a co-licensing agreement. Hinckley said the university wouldn’t profit from the trademark. Stephen R. Hollas, the attorney listed on the Reynolds Family Investments application, didn’t return a message left at his office. NCAA spokesman Wally Renfro didn’t immediately return a message left at his office seeking comment on what an athlete can and can’t do with a trademarked term. The Indianapolis-based governing body bars players from profiting off their athletic achievements. Manziel, 19, skyrocketed to prominence after the 15th- ranked Aggies defeated top-ranked Alabama in Tuscaloosa on Nov. 10. Texas A&M climbed to ninth in the Associated Press Top 25 poll after that win. The school’s website is taking pre-orders for Manziel’s No. 2 jersey, which wasn’t printed prior to the season because he wasn’t a consensus starter. The most prominently displayed football jersey on the site’s retail link is No. 12, which represents the team’s crowd, known as the 12th Man. The university holds a trademark on that phrase. Manziel was at the center of “Manziel Mania” while a multisport star in high school in Kerrville, Texas. No one used “Johnny Football” until he emerged as the starting quarterback at A&M. YouView Loses Appeal of U.K. IPO’s Denial of Trademark YouView TV Ltd. , an Internet-connected TV service, has a name that is too “confusingly similar” to the Your View telecommunications firm, the U.K.’s High Court of Justice ruled. Justice Christopher Floyd affirmed a determination by the U.K.’s Intellectual Property Office, saying he was “unable to see any error of principle” in the hearing officer’s approach in her May 2012 refusal of YouView’s application to register its trademark. In his Nov. 11 ruling, he said wasn’t persuaded by YouView’s argument that consumers would be able to distinguish between “YourView” and “Your View” because one mark was one word and the other was two. He said the hearing officer’s finding that the two phrases were aurally similar “was a matter for judgment and I do not disagree with her assessment.” The case is Between YouView TV Ltd. and Total Ltd., in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division (2012)WQHC 3158 (CH). Ford Files Application for ‘Black Label’ Trademark for Lincolns The Ford Motor Co. (F) , the 109-year-old automaker, has applied to register “Lincoln Black Label” as a trademark, according to the database of the U.S. patent and trademark office. The application, filed Oct. 15, specifies that the term will be used with passenger automobiles. A number of other companies have used black labels to indicate exclusive or expensive qualities, such as Jose Cuervo Black Medallion tequila, and Johnny Walker Black Label Blended Scotch Whisky.

(HD) , Pizza Hut Inc. and two advertising firms over allegations that the companies used the rock band’s songs in commercials without permission. “The parties to this action have reached a settlement agreement in principle that will result in the voluntary dismissal of this action,” U.S. District Judge Otis Wright said in a court filing in Los Angeles Nov. 13. The Black Keys, a duo comprising Patrick Carney and Daniel Auerbach, sued in June, alleging the unauthorized use of their songs “Lonely Boy” in a Home Depot ad and “Gold on the Ceiling” in a Pizza Hut ad. The group also sued Interpublic Group of Cos. and its Martin Agency unit. Wright set a settlement hearing for Jan. 7. He said the hearing will be canceled if the parties file a proposed order of dismissal. Home Depot, based in Atlanta, is the largest U.S. home- improvement retailer. Pizza Hut is a unit of Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM)  The cases are Auerbach v. Pizza Hut, 12-05385, and Auerbach v.

(AAPL) , maker of the iPod and iPhone, filed an appeal of a Chinese copyright infringement verdict, Xinhua reported. The petition appealing the infringement verdict by the Beijing Second Intermediate People’s Court was filed Nov. 13, according to Xinhua.

Another group of second-lien creditors opposed giving Kodak more time to file a reorganization plan and expects to oppose the financing as well, Michael Stamer, an attorney for the creditors, told Gropper yesterday. The group is concerned that another group of lenders won’t have a chance to offer a competing loan package, Stamer said. Kodak Chief Executive Officer Antonio Perez has been selling businesses to help fund a turnaround after seeking Chapter 11 protection in January. The case is In re Eastman Kodak Co., 12-10202, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ). AstraZeneca Responds to Adverse Seroquel Patent Ruling AstraZeneca Plc is “disappointed” with a court ruling invalidating a patent for a drug used to treat bipolar disorder, the company said in a statement Nov. 13. The London-based pharmaceutical company was responding to a ruling by the Federal Patent Court in Germany that found the formulation patent for Seroquel XR (quitiapine fumarate) prolonged-release tablets to be invalid. The patent had been challenged by Teva Deustschland GmbH, Hexal AG and Accord Healthcare Ltd., AstraZeneca said. The ruling is limited to Germany and isn’t binding in other countries. London-based AstraZeneca said it sold $82 million worth of Seroquel XR in Germany for the first 10 months of 2012. For more patent news, click here. Trademarks Rosneft Claims Siberian Gas Station Chain Infringes Mark Rosneft OAO (ROSN) , Russia ’s state-owned energy company, claims its trademarks are being infringed by a chain of gas stations in Siberia, the Moscow Times reported. The case is being pursued as a criminal matter, in addition to a civil dispute involving an estimated 784 million rubles ($24.7 million), according to the newspaper. The chain, based in Novokuznetsk and not named by the newspaper, is accused of using a logo similar to Rosneft’s. Police investigators told the Times the Siberian company’s logo was so similar to the state-owned company’s “that they are almost identical.” Texas A&M Player Manziel Seeks ‘Johnny Football’ Trademark Johnny Manziel is trying to trademark the term “Johnny Football,” even as National Collegiate Athletic Association rules prevent the Texas A&M quarterback or his family from profiting from the mark while he’s a college athlete. The Manziel family is working in conjunction with the university to protect the trademark, the player’s likeness and the freshman’s eligibility, said Shane Hinckley, assistant vice president of business development at the College Station, Texas- based school. Jay Jordan of the Tyler, Texas, law firm of J. Bennett White is representing the family. He said in a telephone interview that he couldn’t discuss legal or other strategies. “We’re exploring every avenue and believe several are open to us with regard to protection of ‘Johnny Football,’” he said. Jordan wouldn’t say whether the family planned to use the mark commercially or apply for extensions once their ownership of the mark is granted by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. Kenneth R. Reynolds Family Investments of College Station, Texas, filed a “Johnny Football” trademark application with the federal agency on Nov. 1. Jordan said the party is unrelated to the Manziel family and that the application would be opposed. “Efforts are ongoing to eradicate those who seek to pirate the mark,” he said, declining to say whether Manziel has had talks with the university about a co-licensing agreement. Hinckley said the university wouldn’t profit from the trademark. Stephen R. Hollas, the attorney listed on the Reynolds Family Investments application, didn’t return a message left at his office. NCAA spokesman Wally Renfro didn’t immediately return a message left at his office seeking comment on what an athlete can and can’t do with a trademarked term. The Indianapolis-based governing body bars players from profiting off their athletic achievements. Manziel, 19, skyrocketed to prominence after the 15th- ranked Aggies defeated top-ranked Alabama in Tuscaloosa on Nov. 10. Texas A&M climbed to ninth in the Associated Press Top 25 poll after that win. The school’s website is taking pre-orders for Manziel’s No. 2 jersey, which wasn’t printed prior to the season because he wasn’t a consensus starter. The most prominently displayed football jersey on the site’s retail link is No. 12, which represents the team’s crowd, known as the 12th Man. The university holds a trademark on that phrase. Manziel was at the center of “Manziel Mania” while a multisport star in high school in Kerrville, Texas. No one used “Johnny Football” until he emerged as the starting quarterback at A&M. YouView Loses Appeal of U.K. IPO’s Denial of Trademark YouView TV Ltd. , an Internet-connected TV service, has a name that is too “confusingly similar” to the Your View telecommunications firm, the U.K.’s High Court of Justice ruled. Justice Christopher Floyd affirmed a determination by the U.K.’s Intellectual Property Office, saying he was “unable to see any error of principle” in the hearing officer’s approach in her May 2012 refusal of YouView’s application to register its trademark. In his Nov. 11 ruling, he said wasn’t persuaded by YouView’s argument that consumers would be able to distinguish between “YourView” and “Your View” because one mark was one word and the other was two. He said the hearing officer’s finding that the two phrases were aurally similar “was a matter for judgment and I do not disagree with her assessment.” The case is Between YouView TV Ltd. and Total Ltd., in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division (2012)WQHC 3158 (CH). Ford Files Application for ‘Black Label’ Trademark for Lincolns The Ford Motor Co. (F) , the 109-year-old automaker, has applied to register “Lincoln Black Label” as a trademark, according to the database of the U.S. patent and trademark office. The application, filed Oct. 15, specifies that the term will be used with passenger automobiles. A number of other companies have used black labels to indicate exclusive or expensive qualities, such as Jose Cuervo Black Medallion tequila, and Johnny Walker Black Label Blended Scotch Whisky.

(HD) , Pizza Hut Inc. and two advertising firms over allegations that the companies used the rock band’s songs in commercials without permission. “The parties to this action have reached a settlement agreement in principle that will result in the voluntary dismissal of this action,” U.S. District Judge Otis Wright said in a court filing in Los Angeles Nov. 13. The Black Keys, a duo comprising Patrick Carney and Daniel Auerbach, sued in June, alleging the unauthorized use of their songs “Lonely Boy” in a Home Depot ad and “Gold on the Ceiling” in a Pizza Hut ad. The group also sued Interpublic Group of Cos. and its Martin Agency unit. Wright set a settlement hearing for Jan. 7. He said the hearing will be canceled if the parties file a proposed order of dismissal. Home Depot, based in Atlanta, is the largest U.S. home- improvement retailer. Pizza Hut is a unit of Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM)  The cases are Auerbach v. Pizza Hut, 12-05385, and Auerbach v. Home Depot, 12-05386, U.S. District Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles). Apple Files Appeal of Chinese Copyright-Infringement Verdict Apple Inc. (AAPL) , maker of the iPod and iPhone, filed an appeal of a Chinese copyright infringement verdict, Xinhua reported. The petition appealing the infringement verdict by the Beijing Second Intermediate People’s Court was filed Nov. 13, according to Xinhua. The court had ordered Cupertino, California-based Apple to pay Encyclopedia of China Publishing House 520,000 yuan ($83,500) in damages for allegedly using part of a digital version of the encyclopedia without permission, Xinhua reported. The newspaper reported that the digital version was offered through Apple’s App Store. For more copyright news, click here.

Nintendo Faces Wii U Shortage After Debut in U.S. This Weekend,['Naoko Fujimura'],2012-11-16 10:46:46,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/nintendo-faces-wii-u-shortage-after-debut-in-u-s-this-weekend.html,"Nintendo Co. (7974) ’s new Wii U will likely fly off store shelves during the holiday shopping season , giving the creator of Mario and Zelda a temporary boost as it tries to rebound from its first annual loss. The Wii U debuts in the U.S. on Nov. 18 starting at $300, and shortages are likely as the company is expected to sell 3.5 million units this year, according to market researcher IHS Screen Digest. The long-term outlook for the home console and its software isn’t so promising as the world’s biggest maker of video-game machines faces surging sales of smartphones and tablets, which players use for free online games. Pressure is mounting on President Satoru Iwata to repeat the success of the Wii console after the 3DS handheld player failed to meet sales expectations in overseas markets, prompting the company to cut its profit goal by 70 percent last month. Nintendo and rival console makers Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Sony Corp. (6758) all face increased competition in the gaming market as consumers turn to smartphones and tablets such as Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad to play free games like “Angry Birds.” “If the Wii U fails to return Nintendo back to strong profitability, there is likely to be questions asked of the strategic direction of the company and the execution of that strategy,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, London-based head of games at IHS Screen Digest. Supply Shortage The Wii U may sell out during the first six months of its release, said Michael Pachter , a Los Angeles-based analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. Demand after that may be about 10 million units a year, he said. By comparison, sales of the Wii reached 5.84 million units in the four months after its November 2006 release, and 18.6 million in the 12 months ended March 2008, according to the company. Iwata, 52, told analysts and investors Oct. 25 the Wii U may be in short supply this year because production only began “this summer,” according to Nintendo’s website. “It has now become more likely that it is our production capacity, rather than consumer demand, that will place limits on our Wii U prospects for this calendar year,” Iwata said Oct. 25, according to the website. Yasuhiro Minagawa, a spokesman for Nintendo, declined to give a forecast for initial shipments. The console maker said Oct. 24 it expects to sell 5.5 million units by March 31. Google, Amazon “The Wii U won’t be as popular as the Wii,” said Takashi Oka, a Tokyo-based analyst at TIW Inc., who estimates the Kyoto, Japan-based company will sell 16 million Wii Us in the year starting April 1. “Nintendo won’t be able to return to the same level as before.” The machine goes on sale in Europe and Australia on Nov. 30 and in Japan on Dec. 8. The Wii U ’s GamePad controller lets users wirelessly connect to the console so characters can jump between the device and a TV. Players also can use the tablet-like controller to capture screenshots of a game and share them with friends through the Miiverse social network. The console also features Nintendo TVii, which can access streaming video services including Amazon.com’s Instant Video, Google Inc.’s YouTube and Netflix Inc. Mario, Lego The company is introducing the machine with 23 titles, including “New Super Mario Bros. U” and “Lego City: Undercover,” and will add 29 more by the end of March in the U.S., it said Sept. 26. That compares with the 18 titles released for the 3DS’s debut in the U.S. in March 2011 -- none of them featuring the company’s iconic plumber in red overalls. After adding high-definition graphics to the Wii U, Nintendo attracted developers including Activision Blizzard Inc. and Electronic Arts Inc. that focused on games for Sony’s PlayStation 3 and Microsoft’s XBox 360 because of the Wii’s limitations. Ubisoft Entertainment’s “ZombiU” game will be exclusive to the Wii U. Nintendo rose 1.4 percent to 10,550 yen in Osaka trading, compared with a 2.2 percent gain in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. The company, which is little changed for the year, posted its first annual loss on a stronger yen and sluggish demand for the 3DS that prompted a price cut. Apple declined 2.1 percent to $525.62 in New York trading, trimming its year-to-date gain to 30 percent. The 3DS, which can display 3-D images without glasses, has picked up sales momentum in Japan with titles including “New Super Mario Bros. 2” and Capcom Co.’s “Monster Hunter 3 (Tri) G,” Nintendo said. The player “is not strong enough yet” in the U.S. and Europe, Iwata said Oct. 25. IPhone, IPad “The company must sell the Wii U as planned, otherwise it may not be able to become profitable,” said Mitsushige Akino , who oversees the equivalent of about $600 million in assets at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. in Tokyo. “The company is in a difficult situation as players now opt for the iPhone and iPad to kill time.” The Wii U will sell at a loss, Senior Managing Director Yoshihiro Mori said Oct. 24. Net income may total 6 billion yen for the year ending March 31, compared with Nintendo’s previous estimate of 20 billion yen, the company said Oct. 24. The game maker posted a 43.2 billion-yen full-year loss in the preceding 12 months, its first since the company went public in 1962. Nintendo’s annual operating profit averaged 359 billion yen in the five years ended March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last fiscal year, the operating loss was 37.3 billion yen. Apple, Microsoft The Wii U’s success may also help Nintendo suppliers, including Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , which worked with the video-game maker to develop system chips to process graphics and run software programs for the Wii U, according to Nintendo’s website. More than 500,000 customers worldwide are on a waiting list for the device, GameStop Corp. (GME) , a specialty retailer with 6,600 stores in the U.S. and Europe, said yesterday. Shoppers placed orders for 1.2 million Wii U titles worldwide, more than double that of the original Wii launch, GameStop President Tony Bartel said in an earnings conference call. Still, the console is being introduced in a different market than its predecessor. Cupertino, California-based Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010, and its App Store has more than 700,000 applications, Apple said last month. U.S. retail sales of video-game software, hardware and accessories fell 25 percent from a year earlier to $755.5 million in October, NPD Group Inc. said Nov. 8. The drop was led by a 37 percent decline in console sales to $187.3 million, the Port Washington , New York-based company said. That’s forced Nintendo to sell its devices at a loss at the wholesale level and try to recover profit elsewhere, including through direct sales, Harding-Rolls said. “This launch is critically important,” Reggie Fils-Aime , president of Nintendo of America Inc., said in a September interview. “Are we an anachronism? No way.” To contact the reporter on this story: Naoko Fujimura in Tokyo at  nfujimura@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Tighe at  mtighe4@bloomberg.net",['Naoko Fujimura'],"Nintendo Faces Wii U Shortage After Debut in U.S. This Weekend Nintendo Co.

Sony Shares Plunge After Convertible Bond Offering: Tokyo Mover,['Mariko Yasu'],2012-11-15 05:34:38,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/sony-shares-plunge-after-convertible-bond-offer-tokyo-mover.html,"Sony Corp. (6758) , the Japanese electronics maker reeling from four consecutive annual losses , fell to the lowest level in more than 32 years in Tokyo trading after offering its first convertible bonds in almost a decade. The shares dropped as much as 11 percent to 772 yen and changed hands at 791 yen as of 2:23 p.m. in Tokyo. That extended the year-to-date slump to 44 percent, valuing the company at 780 billion yen ($9.7 billion). The maker of Bravia TVs offered 150 billion yen of zero- coupon convertible bonds maturing in five years with a conversion price of 957 yen, or 10 percent above the stock’s closing price in Tokyo yesterday. The proceeds will be used to fund acquisitions and expand its imaging-sensor facilities, the company said in a statement. “There’s a risk of dilution of equity given the amount on offer, relative to Sony’s market capitalization,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Securities Co. in Tokyo with an underperform rating on the company. “If you consider the potential for the stock to rise, shareholders may be thinking the upside is uncertain. That’s probably behind today’s decline in share price.” The first convertible bond sale from Sony since 2003 comes as the maker of Walkman music players is projected to lose money at its main television business for a ninth straight year. Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai is cutting 10,000 jobs and selling assets as he focuses on mobile devices, games and digital imaging to turn around the company amid competition with Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  Dilution Risk The zero-coupon notes due in November 2017 may be exchanged for stock if Sony’s shares rise above the conversion price. The sale would add 156.7 million shares, or 15.6 percent of shares currently outstanding, if all were converted, Yuji Fujimori , an analyst at Barclays Plc, said in his report today. “We expect the share price to remain below the conversion price in the near term owing to concerns about dilution risk,” Tokyo-based Fujimori said. Sony’s American depositary receipts fell 8.8 percent to $9.82 at the close in New York yesterday, the lowest level since June 1987 (SNE) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The market valuation of Sony, worth more than $120 billion in 2000, compares with the $505 billion valuation of Apple and $180 billion of Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung. Shares of Sony’s domestic competitors Panasonic Corp. (6752) and Sharp Corp. (6753) have also declined in value this year. Credit Default Swap Sony’s credit risk declined to the lowest in almost two months after reaching a record high earlier this month. The cost to insure the debt of Sony for five years against non-payment dropped 30.6 basis points to 391 basis points as of 1:06 p.m. in Tokyo, according to intraday prices from data provider CMA. That’s set for the lowest closing level since Sept. 19, CMA prices in New York show. Sony’s long-term credit rating have been downgraded twice by Moody’s Investors Service since August, while Standard & Poor’s cut its rating once in September as the maker of Walkman music players struggles without a hit product to challenge Apple. The maker of PlayStation game consoles will use 60 billion yen of the proceeds to invest in CMOS image sensors, 50 billion yen to repay short-term debts for acquiring shares of Olympus Corp. (7733) , 10 billion yen to repay borrowings for acquiring Gaikai Inc. and 30 billion yen to repay bonds maturing next year, according to the statement. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Nomura Holdings Inc. and SMBC Nikko Capital Markets Ltd. were hired to manage the sale, which will be in overseas markets excluding the U.S., according to Sony’s statement yesterday. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. were also hired as underwriters, according to a regulatory filing today. Sony last sold bonds in March, when it raised 55 billion yen from a two-part offering including 45 billion yen of 0.664 percent five-year notes, not convertible to shares, priced at a spread of 36 basis points more than government debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

(HPQ) announces its earnings next week. As more consumers and businesses flock to smartphones and tablets, companies led by Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) that long benefited from demand for PCs are feeling the pain. Dell will report a 10 percent drop in sales, while Hewlett-Packard’s revenue fell 6 percent in the most recent quarter, estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. The declines mark a reversal from the 1980s, when Microsoft co-Founder Bill Gates and Dell Founder Michael Dell helped usher in the PC age with low-cost machines that transformed how companies work and made it easy for consumers to use computers. The PC shunted aside bigger, pricier, more complex minicomputers and mainframes that once dominated the industry. “PC makers are succumbing to the fate of those who don’t learn from history, not even their own,” said Erik Gordon , a professor at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. The industry’s reaction has been “like responding to the early auto industry by trying to attach wheels to the hooves of horses.” Microsoft, Dell and Hewlett-Packard are introducing their own tablet computers, and Microsoft has revamped its mobile- phone software in time for the year-end shopping season. Yet all three lag behind Apple Inc., Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. in tablets, and Microsoft’s share of smartphones is a fraction of the slice commanded by Apple and Google. PC Woe PC shipments tumbled 8.3 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to market researcher Gartner Inc., and are forecast to fall this year for the first annual decline since 2001, according to IHS iSuppli. Windows sales fell 33 percent in Microsoft’s most recent quarter, and revenue in Intel Corp.’s key third quarter -- when PC makers typically stock up on chips for the holiday season -- declined sequentially for the first time in more than 20 years. The news probably won’t get better soon. Round Rock, Texas-based Dell may report third-quarter sales fell to $13.9 billion and earnings excluding some items tumbled 27 percent to 40 cents a share, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Growth at the computer maker has stagnated, even after an acquisition spree since 2009 to diversify into storage, information-technology services and networking gear for corporate data centers. ‘Lackluster Innovation’ “They are de-emphasizing the PC business,” said Abhey Lamba , an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA. “There will be revenue headwinds from that, and their other businesses need investment.” Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, California , may be in even worse shape. Fourth-quarter sales may drop to $30.5 billion and earnings excluding some items may fall 3 percent to $1.14 a share, according to analysts’ average estimate. Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman has said a turnaround won’t happen anytime soon, and the company on Oct. 3 slashed its earnings forecast, sending shares to a 10-year low. “The innovation coming from those two companies has just been lackluster,” said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Portland, Oregon-based Becker Capital Management Inc. The PC makers’ stocks have been battered, which means investors aren’t paying much for already meager profit. Hewlett- Packard is trading at 3.3 times next year’s projected earnings and Dell at 5.5 times, among the cheapest companies among their peer group, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Smartphone Ascent Dell rose 1.9 percent to $9.58 at the close in New York yesterday, trimming the year-to-date decline to 35 percent. Hewlett-Packard was little changed at $13.14, and the stock is down 49 percent this year. While PC sales languish, smartphone shipments of 488 million last year overtook the number of PCs shipped for the first time, according to market researcher Canalys. Sales of iPads and other tablets are forecast to increase 26 percent to $79.4 billion next year, according to NPD DisplaySearch. In notebooks -- the category the PC makers just a few years ago counted on for growth -- Apple has surpassed Hewlett-Packard as the top supplier in terms of revenue. To be sure, PCs aren’t going away any time soon. The industry will ship 348.7 million of them this year, according to IHS iSuppli. Microsoft’s Surface -- a hybrid tablet computer that converts into a small laptop -- has received mostly positive reviews. Tombstone Written “There are plenty of people who’ve already written the tombstone, and you could say that’s a bit premature,” said Michael Shinnick, a portfolio manager at Wasatch Advisors Inc. in South Bend, Indiana , which holds Dell shares. Windows 8, Microsoft’s much vaunted new software release, may be a mixed bag for the industry, though. Any new release of Windows spurs a wave of buying, which lifts all companies in the PC ecosystem. Yet many companies may eschew buying Windows 8 as they keep machines longer and are just now upgrading to the last version. Old alliances are splintering too: Microsoft’s recently released Surface tablet runs a version of Windows called RT built for chips made by ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) -- not its longtime partner Intel. And it competes directly with machines made by Hewlett-Packard, Dell and other electronics makers. Microsoft may have a hard time selling business users on Surface instead of the iPad if they don’t need its stalwart Office suite of productivity programs, said Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. The machine and Windows 8 are designed around a revamped home screen featuring colorful tiles that launch programs and update users with current information from the Internet. “If you don’t need Office, you don’t need Windows 8,” he said. “This is the concern everyone has about Microsoft right now.” To contact the reporter on this story: Aaron Ricadela in San Francisco at  aricadela@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net",['Aaron Ricadela'],"Dell, HP Earnings Expected to Herald the End of PC Era (Corrects story that ran Nov. 15 to show Wasatch no longer holds Hewlett-Packard shares.)

High-End Smartphone Boom Ending as Price Drop Hits Apple,['Peter Burrows'],2013-07-21 16:21:25,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-21/high-end-smartphone-boom-ending-as-price-drop-hits-apple.html,"The smartphone has crossed the line from shiny new technology to ubiquitous commodity. App-laden, Web-surfing phones have surged in popularity over the past half-decade and generated $293.9 billion in sales last year alone. They are now used by more than 1 billion people around the world. With more than half of mobile users in the U.S. and developed countries owning a smartphone, and consumers in emerging markets including China and India gravitating toward cheaper models, demand is slowing for high-end devices. The average price of a smartphone has plunged to $375 from $450 since the beginning of 2012, IDC estimates. That drop has already threatened revenue growth and profit margins at Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , and could further squeeze companies like Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) and BlackBerry that were counting on new products to revive sales. Beneficiaries include up-and-comers, such as Huawei Technologies Co. and Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , which specialize in low-priced gear. “The days of great growth in the high end of the market are gone,” said Michael Morgan, an analyst at ABI Research. “It’s the Chinese companies who know how to survive on tiny margins that are ready for the fight that’s about to ensue.” The decline in average smartphone prices is akin to what happened in the personal-computer industry in the late 1990s, according to former EMachines Inc. Chief Executive Officer Stephen Dukker. Back then, millions of people who wanted to get online for the first time snapped up cheap new PCs from EMachines and other low-cost providers, dragging down once-stable PC prices to $1,026 in 2002 from $1,898 in 1996, according to IDC. Feeling Pinch Apple, Samsung and other companies relying on sales of expensive phones are already feeling the pinch. In June, Samsung lost more than $25 billion in market capitalization, greater than the value of Sony Corp. (6758) , as analysts trimmed projections for Samsung’s high-end Galaxy S4 smartphone, which costs $200 when sold as part of a two-year wireless package, or about $630 without a carrier subsidy. “The market is becoming less about speeds and feeds, and more about price,” said Kevin Restivo, an analyst at IDC in Toronto. “More people don’t need to be overwhelmed by a phone, so long as it’s good enough.” HTC Corp. (2498) , Taiwan’s largest smartphone maker, missed analysts’ sales and profit estimates for its second quarter amid disappointing sales of its HTC One handset, which costs $200 with a package, or $600 to $700 without one. On July 12, carriers cut the price of BlackBerry’s poor-selling Z10 to $50 from $200 -- just six months after it was introduced. IPhone Estimates Apple, based in Cupertino, California, is predicted to report on July 23 that fiscal third-quarter revenue was little changed from a year earlier, based on the average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg, mainly because of slowing iPhone sales. That would be the worst sales performance since 2003’s second quarter, when revenue declined 1.3 percent. T. Michael Walkley , an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Inc., last month lowered his estimate for iPhone sales for fiscal 2014 to 173 million from 181 million. Natalie Kerris , a spokeswoman for Apple, declined to comment on iPhone sales. Falling prices and the popularity of products with lower margins such as the iPad mini are beginning to hit Apple’s profitability. While the company makes a gross margin of more than 50 percent on the iPhone 5, sold for more than $600 to carriers, it has sold millions of older models in recent years at lower prices at a gross margin of 35 percent or less, according to Brian Marshall , an analyst at ISI Group. Apple’s gross margin fell to 37.5 percent in the period that ended in March, from 47.4 percent a year earlier. Consumers Content Apple shares have dropped 39 percent from a record in September amid concerns of slowing iPhone growth and declining margins. They declined 1.6 percent to $424.95 on July 19. While any innovations may slow the drop in prices -- for example, Apple, Samsung and others are working on wearable, wristwatch-like device, which could stoke sales -- most people are content with the size, shape and features of basic smartphones, ABI’s Morgan said. Morgan predicts Apple will introduce an iPhone 5S this September that could come in different colors and feature a fingerprint reader so owners wouldn’t have to remember a security code. That won’t be enough to revive iPhone sales growth for long, he said. Chinese Suppliers More of those profits will be won in emerging markets, where many consumers have yet to buy their first smartphone. IDC’s Restivo predicts that 66 percent of the 384 million smartphones sold in China next year will cost less than $200, compared with 14 percent of the 153 million phones projected to be sold in the U.S. China-based suppliers of less-expensive phones, such as Huawei, have been gaining market share, mostly by undercutting HTC, BlackBerry (BBRY) and Nokia on price. Even as its phones priced as low as $100 sell briskly, Huawei’s two-year-old devices unit is profitable, Shao Yang, the company’s vice president of marketing, wrote in an e-mail. Lenovo has used the same low-price strategy that has made it the world’s largest PC maker to become the fastest-growing smartphone maker in China, said J.D. Howard, vice president of operations and business development for Lenovo’s smartphone, tablet and TV unit. “It really works in the smartphone business, because some of our rivals have been charging a ridiculous premium,” he said. PC History If the history of PCs is any guide, price wars can quickly lead to industrywide carnage. In the years after cheap models such as EMachines’ $600 desktop became popular in 1998, average PC margins narrowed to less than 10 percent from more than 15 percent, not enough to cover the research and other costs at bigger companies, Dukker said. As margins shrank and losses mounted, PC makers merged and divested the commodity business. Onetime leader Compaq Computer Corp. was acquired by Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) in 2002, and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) sold its PC business to Lenovo in 2005. Gateway Inc. purchased EMachines in 2004, only to be bought by Acer Inc. (2353) in 2007. The two smartphone powerhouses, Apple and Samsung, are better-positioned than Compaq and IBM were in PCs. While most of its marketing in the U.S. focuses on high-end devices like the Galaxy 4S, Samsung sells hundreds of models at all price points. As one of the largest manufacturers of chips, displays and other smartphone parts, Samsung can reach lower price points more easily than rivals who must buy those components -- often from Samsung itself. Strong Ecosystem Apple’s strong brand and ecosystem of music, services and more than 800,000 applications should help it maintain its large customer base, according to David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School. The company has also shown it can profitably appeal to thriftier shoppers with older iPhone models. About half of the iPhones sold by Verizon Wireless in recent quarters were iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S models, which Verizon and other carriers sell for $99, or give to customers who agree to a two-year contract. More recently, Apple has helped carriers run trade-in programs that give shoppers as much as $200 in credit toward an iPhone 5 if they hand in their existing iPhone. Without these efforts, Apple would have lost even more market share to Samsung and other makers of smartphones running Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software, Yoffie said. “As growth increasingly comes from emerging markets, Apple is not going hold share,” Yoffie said. “An evolution in strategy is definitely necessary. They can’t stay where they are.” To contact the reporter on this story: Peter Burrows in San Francisco at pburrows@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net",['Peter Burrows'],"High-End Smartphone Boom Ending as Price Drop Hits Apple The smartphone has crossed the line from shiny new technology to ubiquitous commodity.

"Netflix Rules as S&P 500 Index’s Top Stock, Spurs Bubble",['Linda S' 'ler'],2013-07-22 20:33:02,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-21/netflix-rule-as-no-1-s-p-performer-but-.html,"Netflix Inc. (NFLX) has become the best performing U.S. stock in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in 2013 and the second most expensive, and therein lies a tale of disagreement. Investors who dig into company filings can find negative free cash flow , a surge in liabilities for new movie and TV-show content and a long-term increase in unpaid subscribers. Moreover, perceived limits on customer numbers and the high price of shares have led 26 of the 37 Bloomberg-listed a nalysts covering the stock to advise investors to sell or hold stakes. Most shareholders aren’t listening to talk about a bubble or other bad news. They love Netflix. Michael Pachter , a managing director at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles , says a lot of investors are dazzled by the growth potential of online businesses, such as Amazon.com Inc., a startup-turned-industry-giant that sold $16 billion of merchandise in the first quarter. As long as there is growth, these investors, “in a weird bubble of Internet stocks,” show little concern about the finances of online companies, he said. “Netflix looks like Amazon to most investors,” said Pachter, who rates the No. 1 Internet video subscription service “underperform” and has a target price of $65. Earnings Call Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings may get questions about the Los Gatos-California-based company’s performance when he hosts a videoconference today to discuss second-quarter earnings. Hastings, 52, who owns about $690 million in Netflix stock, will also be in position to trumpet the success of the drama series, “House of Cards,” which received nine Emmy Award nominations last week, including best drama. It’s the first time an Internet streaming service has vied for these top entertainment honors. Netflix got 14 Emmy nominations in all. Fielding questions from fellow analysts on the call will be Richard Greenfield of BTIG LLC, which specializes in trading and services for hedge funds. He saw Netflix stock shoot past his April target of $250 and plans to reassess his projection after he hears the results today. One probable positive that’s already clear, he said: The Emmy nominations may encourage talented people to participate in Netflix’s “next big show.” Investors who want to check if the naysayers have a point can start with a review of cautionary disclosures Netflix has made in regulatory filings and in correspondence with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As with most CEOs, such items aren’t the principal focus of Hastings’s popular accentuate-the-positive message in telling his company’s story. Content Spending Front and center in such an analysis is how much Netflix, with a market capitalization of almost $15 billion, spends on content. It pays about $500 million a quarter, while running a deficit in free cash flow in the past two quarters, company filings show. It has $5.7 billion of binding contracts to pay for and license streaming content, of which about $2.4 billion is payable in less than a year, according to its first-quarter filing. Another $2.7 billion is due in one to three years. In a December pact, Netflix probably agreed to pay more than $350 million a year for Walt Disney Co. movies, estimated Tony Wible , an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Netflix doesn’t disclose such details, spokesman Jonathan Friedland said. DreamWorks Deal Warner Bros. Television Group is another beneficiary of Netflix’s spending, providing such dramas as “Revolution.” Lionsgate Television produced one of Netflix’s original series, the prison comedy “Orange Is the New Black.” Netflix has a multiyear pact with Twentieth Century Fox Television to stream past seasons of “New Girl” and has agreed to buy shows from DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. Netflix also offers HBO’s “Game of Thrones” on DVD. First-quarter free cash flow was “negative $42 million” because of spending for such shows, Hastings’s April letter to shareholders said. Pachter, whose unit is part of the financial services and investment firm, Wedbush Inc., said Netflix made a conscious decision to spend aggressively to buy new content even if that meant running out of cash. “They’re financially fragile by choice,” he said. His concern: “If their cash flow continues negative they could have a problem.” Netflix itself says the same in its last annual report: “To the extent subscriber and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content licensing commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain licenses.” Raising Prices Netflix could handle content payments by raising prices to subscribers. Hastings has said he doesn’t favor that. No wonder. In 2011, Netflix announced it would separate its DVD-by-mail and streaming plans, with each available for $7.99 a month. Customers with joint streaming and DVDs plans saw bills jump to $15.99 from $9.99. After that 60 percent bump, about 800,000 subscribers canceled. The stock hit a low in November of that year of $63.86, down from a 2011 high of about $299. It’s still not back to that level. If Hastings doesn’t budge on streaming prices, he might have to keep selling stock or debt. That wouldn’t be good for shareholders, Pachter said. In February, Netflix sold $500 million of junk bonds to help fund programming and retire debt. Netflix also is adding business risks as it licenses more original series that don’t have a proven track record like the hit AMC “Mad Men” series it offers. “There is always the chance any particular show could flop,” said an April report by New York-based Jefferies Group LLC, a securities and investment-banking firm. “Prior content deals offered a more predictable return profile.” Internet TV One of Hastings’s key messages to investors has been about that growth Pachter says Internet investors are focused on. The CEO says Netflix is “leading the way” toward “ Internet TV ,” a concept designed to rival cable. Other key metrics in assessing the company include revenue, subscriber numbers and, in the long term, profit. Netflix revenue was $3.6 billion last year, up from $3.2 billion the year before. Profit was $17.2 million in 2012, after rising annually since 2003. Profits peaked at $226.1 million in 2011. That drop in 2012 was partly because the company offered more free-trial subscriptions. Overseas that promotion resulted in a first-quarter loss of $11 per customer, according to company filings. The profit trend improved in the first quarter. Net income of $2.7 million compared with a year-earlier loss of $4.6 million. For all of 2013, analysts tracked by Bloomberg estimate profit of $1.44 a share in profit, an increase from 2012’s 29 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 52-Week High In the face of these results, the company’s stock reached a 52-week closing high of $267.92 on July 17 and now trades at 383 times 12-month profit, surpassed only by Alcoa Inc. in the S&P 500 , data compiled by Bloomberg show. Its estimated price/earnings ratio for 2013 is 184. The P/E ratio for the S&P 500 Index is currently 16. Netflix’s 185 percent gain this year is the best in the S&P 500. Netflix fell as much as $7.46, or 2.8 percent, and closed down $2.62 to $261.96 on trading on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange as the company said it signed up 630,000 new U.S. Internet customers in the second quarter, missing analysts’ estimates. “The current valuation reflects unrealistic expectations across all major economic and strategic levers of the business,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Carlos Kirjner wrote in a June 25 report when he downgraded the stock to “underperform” with a price target of $180, about a third lower than what it closed at last week. At the same time, Netflix has to deal with the perception that market forces may interfere with its customer-growth goals. Hastings has said he would like to get 60 million to 90 million U.S. customers, about two to three times HBO ’s domestic total. Limited Market Here is how one skeptic sees that plan: Netflix’s potential market is the 45 million households that have broadband connections powerful enough to support Netflix’s streaming video products and to connect their TVs to the Internet today, Kirjner said in his June 25 report. That market may grow to 65 million in several years, and Netflix might eventually get as many as 43 million subscribers, he said. Mobile broadband will not support Netflix “at scale” when carriers place data caps, he said. In a July 15 report, Kirjner said his forecast of the potential market is “perhaps too generous.” Netflix disagrees, saying customers can use a mobile device with WiFi. Its “addressable market” is 80 million U.S. households with some kind of broadband Internet access , according to spokesman Friedland. There has been a debate too about Netflix subscriber numbers. Consider the April 22 report by Variety that Netflix had passed HBO in “total” U.S. subscribers. That report by the entertainment industry bible and other news organizations played a role in one of Netflix’s best stock moves : a 24 percent gain. Unpaid Subscriptions The reports didn’t mention that Netflix subscriber numbers included 1.3 million U.S. users who didn’t pay because of free trials, regulatory filings show. HBO is still the leader in paying U.S. subscribers, according to the SNL Kagan research firm. HBO had about 28.8 million U.S. subscribers in the first quarter, SNL Kagan estimated. Netflix had 27.9 million paying U.S. online subscribers, it said. As of March 31, 5.7 percent of Netflix’s 36.3 million U.S. and international online members weren’t paying -- 4.8 percent of online and DVD customers. “The ebb and flow of free trials is directly tied to the number of markets we open each year,” Friedland said. “We have never said as a company that we passed HBO.” Netflix may also find the audience goal for its product hits a wall, just as HBO has. Customer Limit “HBO has hovered at just under 30 million for several years,” SNL Kagan said in its tally of first-quarter numbers, referring to U.S. subscribers. “Showtime and Starz will continue to slow as they get closer to 30 million.” Netflix will probably pass HBO in paid U.S. subscribers within the next two quarters, SNL Kagan predicted. Netflix’s percentage of non-paying subscribers has grown in recent years with its emphasis on U.S. and overseas online streaming, though it’s down from last year. The 4.8 percent of Internet and DVD members who weren’t paying as of March 31 compares with 3.1 percent in 2009, before it began emphasizing its streaming service, company filings show. A year ago its percentage of non-paying Internet and DVD customers was 5.9 percent. Subscriber Definition Netflix changed its definitions of subscribers in its 2011 annual report to reflect changes in subscription plans, also deciding to stop counting members on payment holds, and how to treat cancellations. Later, Netflix changed its written disclosures on paid membership after the SEC demanded it. The SEC, which polices information relayed to investors, asked Netflix in a June 27, 2012, letter what “differentiates” paid subscriptions from total subscriptions, and told it to disclose the answer in filings. Netflix answered in a July 25, 2012, letter that a subscription is the right to receive its services, after providing a method of payment. Netflix told the SEC that total subscribers included not only free trials and cancellations but also “payment holds” at that time -- accounts Netflix couldn’t get authorization to charge. Footnote Disclosure Netflix, which later removed payment holds from the count, promised to define total subscribers in future filings. It did so -- in footnotes. Its first-quarter report filed April 26 has such a footnote, which isn’t included in the shareholder letter announcing results. Amazon, whose video service is a small part of the total company, doesn’t disclose subscriber numbers. It has fewer than 10 million U.S. customers, estimated Deana Myers, a senior analyst at SNL Kagan. Hulu, which isn’t publicly traded, discloses paying members on its website. Myers estimates that U.S. members of Hulu’s paid service will be 4 million by the end of the year, up from 2.4 million in December. The SEC told Netflix in two letters last year that investors could benefit from knowing just how much the company was spending on content every quarter, considering “the magnitude of this cost component.” Netflix successfully resisted, arguing it wasn’t required by the rules to disclose and that investors would be hurt more than helped because competitors would benefit. “A deeper understanding of our content acquisition costs would assist competitors in designing and implementing their content deals,” it wrote on Oct. 24, 2012. Now, Netflix tells investors it spends $2 billion a year on content. SEC filings show it added $591.9 million to its content library in the first quarter, after spending $2.5 billion in 2012 and $2.3 billion in 2011. Total Liabilities Netflix’s total liabilities, recorded at $3.6 billion, would be at least $3.3 billion higher if all of its contractual obligations for content were on its balance sheet, based on data in its latest quarterly filing. Netflix said the $3.3 billion doesn’t have to be reflected on its balance sheet yet because it doesn’t meet criteria for asset recognition. Disclosures by Netflix have sometimes confused analysts following the stock. Take “Netflix Originals,” a term the company uses for shows such as “House of Cards.” Though they premiere on Netflix, the company doesn’t own them and can’t make money from selling or licensing them to third parties. Rival Amazon is now offering “House of Cards,” which is owned by Media Rights Capital , an independent film and television studio partly backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. It charges $1.99 an episode on its pay-per-view service. It also sells a DVD version. Arms Race Hastings, who told a 2011 UBS AG conference that he’s in an “arms race” with HBO to dominate Web-based TV viewing, is arguably running a different, less lucrative business from its designated rival’s pay-TV and production operation, which produced income of $1.6 billion last year. Netflix is technologically closer to Hulu LLC or Amazon’s online video service because it is accessed online on demand through computers or smartphones or by mail in DVD format. Microsoft Corp., Google Inc., Apple Inc. or Comcast Corp. could start a successful competitor to Netflix, Bernstein analyst Kirjner said in his July 15 report. “We believe the competitive threat is one of the greatest blind spots for Netflix investors,” he said. One famous Netflix holder has had a happy experience with his investment. Sort of. Billionaire financier Carl Icahn made a $168.9 million bet on Netflix stock and options in October. His play: Microsoft, Amazon or Verizon Communications Inc. might be interested in buying Netflix amid a “great consolidation” coming to the business of streaming movies and TV shows. Then he turned a little sour. He lambasted Netflix’s “poor governance” in November after it adopted a poison pill to deter such acquirers. He returned to the pro-Netflix camp after stock price increases this year produced a huge profit for him. “When you make $600-$700 million, you don’t punch the CEO in the face,” Icahn, 77, told Bloomberg News in March.

(NFLX) has become the best performing U.S. stock in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in 2013 and the second most expensive, and therein lies a tale of disagreement. Investors who dig into company filings can find negative free cash flow , a surge in liabilities for new movie and TV-show content and a long-term increase in unpaid subscribers. Moreover, perceived limits on customer numbers and the high price of shares have led 26 of the 37 Bloomberg-listed a nalysts covering the stock to advise investors to sell or hold stakes. Most shareholders aren’t listening to talk about a bubble or other bad news. They love Netflix. Michael Pachter , a managing director at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles , says a lot of investors are dazzled by the growth potential of online businesses, such as Amazon.com Inc., a startup-turned-industry-giant that sold $16 billion of merchandise in the first quarter. As long as there is growth, these investors, “in a weird bubble of Internet stocks,” show little concern about the finances of online companies, he said. “Netflix looks like Amazon to most investors,” said Pachter, who rates the No. 1 Internet video subscription service “underperform” and has a target price of $65. Earnings Call Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings may get questions about the Los Gatos-California-based company’s performance when he hosts a videoconference today to discuss second-quarter earnings. Hastings, 52, who owns about $690 million in Netflix stock, will also be in position to trumpet the success of the drama series, “House of Cards,” which received nine Emmy Award nominations last week, including best drama. It’s the first time an Internet streaming service has vied for these top entertainment honors. Netflix got 14 Emmy nominations in all. Fielding questions from fellow analysts on the call will be Richard Greenfield of BTIG LLC, which specializes in trading and services for hedge funds. He saw Netflix stock shoot past his April target of $250 and plans to reassess his projection after he hears the results today. One probable positive that’s already clear, he said: The Emmy nominations may encourage talented people to participate in Netflix’s “next big show.” Investors who want to check if the naysayers have a point can start with a review of cautionary disclosures Netflix has made in regulatory filings and in correspondence with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As with most CEOs, such items aren’t the principal focus of Hastings’s popular accentuate-the-positive message in telling his company’s story. Content Spending Front and center in such an analysis is how much Netflix, with a market capitalization of almost $15 billion, spends on content. It pays about $500 million a quarter, while running a deficit in free cash flow in the past two quarters, company filings show. It has $5.7 billion of binding contracts to pay for and license streaming content, of which about $2.4 billion is payable in less than a year, according to its first-quarter filing. Another $2.7 billion is due in one to three years. In a December pact, Netflix probably agreed to pay more than $350 million a year for Walt Disney Co. movies, estimated Tony Wible , an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Netflix doesn’t disclose such details, spokesman Jonathan Friedland said. DreamWorks Deal Warner Bros. Television Group is another beneficiary of Netflix’s spending, providing such dramas as “Revolution.” Lionsgate Television produced one of Netflix’s original series, the prison comedy “Orange Is the New Black.” Netflix has a multiyear pact with Twentieth Century Fox Television to stream past seasons of “New Girl” and has agreed to buy shows from DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. Netflix also offers HBO’s “Game of Thrones” on DVD. First-quarter free cash flow was “negative $42 million” because of spending for such shows, Hastings’s April letter to shareholders said. Pachter, whose unit is part of the financial services and investment firm, Wedbush Inc., said Netflix made a conscious decision to spend aggressively to buy new content even if that meant running out of cash. “They’re financially fragile by choice,” he said. His concern: “If their cash flow continues negative they could have a problem.” Netflix itself says the same in its last annual report: “To the extent subscriber and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content licensing commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain licenses.” Raising Prices Netflix could handle content payments by raising prices to subscribers. Hastings has said he doesn’t favor that. No wonder. In 2011, Netflix announced it would separate its DVD-by-mail and streaming plans, with each available for $7.99 a month. Customers with joint streaming and DVDs plans saw bills jump to $15.99 from $9.99. After that 60 percent bump, about 800,000 subscribers canceled. The stock hit a low in November of that year of $63.86, down from a 2011 high of about $299. It’s still not back to that level.

Maersk Line to Dump Panama Canal for Suez as Ships Get Bigger,['Kyunghee Park'],2013-03-11 20:00:03,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/maersk-line-to-dump-panama-canal-for-suez-as-ships-get-bigger.html,"Maersk Line , the world’s biggest container shipping company, will stop using the Panama Canal to transport goods from Asia to the U.S. East Coast as bigger ships help the company move them profitably through Suez Canal. Maersk Line will send through Suez Canal a vessel that can carry as many as 9,000 20-foot boxes at a time, instead of using two 4,500-box-vessels through Panama Canal, Soeren Skou, chief executive officer, said in Singapore yesterday. The last sailing through Panama will be on April 7 and the first service through Suez will be a week later, the company said in an e-mail. “The economics are much, much better via the Suez Canal simply because you have half the number of ships,” Skou said. “One of the reasons for why this is happening now is that the cost for passing through the Panama Canal has gone up. At the end of the day, it comes down to cost.” Shipping companies, including Maersk Line and Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. (NOL) , have cut costs, reduced speed of their fleet and sold some vessels to contend with freight rates that are below break-even levels. Copenhagen, Denmark-based Maersk Line, which is taking delivery in June of an 18,000 TEU vessel -- the world’s biggest when it enters service -- has said pressure on charges will remain this year. The company finds it more cost-effective to send larger ships through the U.S., even if it meant the ships need to sail longer, Skou said. “The practice of using bigger ships through Suez Canal rather than Panama Canal will likely be followed by other carriers,” said Bonnie Chan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. “This gives shipping companies a bit more flexibility in managing capacity.” Suez Vs Panama The number of container ships crossing the Suez Canal fell 12 percent to 6,332 in 2012, according to the waterway’s authority. A total of 17,225 ships of all types traveled the link between the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Suez last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Panama Canal was used by 3,331 container ships last year, up from 3,253 in 2011, according to data on the canal authority’s website. There were 12,862 total crossings. The distance from China , the manufacturing hub for companies such as Apple Inc., to the U.S. east coast via the Suez Canal is about 4 percent to 5 percent more on average, Skou said. For example, the distance from Hong Kong to Charleston is about 12,000 miles via Suez and 11,000 miles via Panama. From Singapore, it’s actually shorter via Suez than through Panama, the company said in the e-mail. ‘Deeply Concerned’ Fees for ships to go through the Panama Canal have tripled in the past five years to $450,000 per passage for a vessel carrying 4,500 containers, Skou said. In February, the Suez Canal Authority announced canal toll increases that would be effective from May, according to the Asian Shipowners’ Forum. The group “is deeply concerned” about the potential impacts of this move, it said in a statement earlier this month. A $5.25 billion expansion of Panama Canal, the waterway handling 5 percent of global trade, will open by June 2015, six months later than originally planned. The canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Six years after the Panama Canal began the expansion to capture shipments of Asian-made goods to the U.S. East Coast, the flow of liquefied natural gas in the opposite direction promises to be a better bet. Shipments of the fuel, along with rising commodity and energy cargoes between the U.S., Latin America and Asia, are likely to provide the largest sources of demand growth when the project is complete in June 2015, according to Administrator Jorge Luis Quijano. Shipping containerized goods, which generate most business for the 50-mile link, has yet to return to the same level as 2007, two years before the global economy had its worst recession since World War II. Whether Maersk will use the Panama Canal after the expansion will depend on the economics, Skou said.

From Singapore, it’s actually shorter via Suez than through Panama, the company said in the e-mail. ‘Deeply Concerned’ Fees for ships to go through the Panama Canal have tripled in the past five years to $450,000 per passage for a vessel carrying 4,500 containers, Skou said. In February, the Suez Canal Authority announced canal toll increases that would be effective from May, according to the Asian Shipowners’ Forum. The group “is deeply concerned” about the potential impacts of this move, it said in a statement earlier this month. A $5.25 billion expansion of Panama Canal, the waterway handling 5 percent of global trade, will open by June 2015, six months later than originally planned. The canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Six years after the Panama Canal began the expansion to capture shipments of Asian-made goods to the U.S. East Coast, the flow of liquefied natural gas in the opposite direction promises to be a better bet. Shipments of the fuel, along with rising commodity and energy cargoes between the U.S., Latin America and Asia, are likely to provide the largest sources of demand growth when the project is complete in June 2015, according to Administrator Jorge Luis Quijano. Shipping containerized goods, which generate most business for the 50-mile link, has yet to return to the same level as 2007, two years before the global economy had its worst recession since World War II. Whether Maersk will use the Panama Canal after the expansion will depend on the economics, Skou said.

BlackBerry Shares Jump as Lenovo CEO Mentions Possible Deal,['Hugo Miller'],2013-03-11 20:17:07,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/blackberry-shares-jump-after-lenovo-ceo-mentions-possible-deal.html,"BlackBerry shares jumped the most in more than a month after Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) ’s chief executive officer was quoted in a French financial newspaper as saying his company may eventually consider buying the smartphone maker. Lenovo’s Yang Yuanqing told Les Echos that a deal with Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry “could possibly make sense, but first I need to analyze the market and understand what exactly the importance of this company is.” The remarks echoed comments made in January by Lenovo Chief Financial Officer Wong Wai Ming, who told Bloomberg News that the company was “looking at all opportunities,” including BlackBerry. The Canadian smartphone maker began a review of its strategic options last year after losing market share to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics Co., raising speculation that it could be a takeover target. Shares of BlackBerry, formerly known as Research In Motion Ltd. (BB) , rose 14 percent to $14.90 at the close in New York, the biggest gain since Feb. 4. The stock has climbed 26 percent this year. Any foreign bid for BlackBerry would need regulatory approval. The Canadian government automatically reviews all foreign takeovers of companies with asset values of more than C$344 million ($335 million) to determine whether the transactions are of “net benefit” to the country. Not Talking When asked in January about Wong’s comments, BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins said he didn’t know why the Lenovo executive had made those remarks. “As always with these topics, we will talk about things when they are ready to be talked about and ready to be announced,” Heins said in an interview at the time. “There are other constituents in the process that need to be involved -- if there would be anything.” BlackBerry reports quarterly results on March 28, when Heins is expected to update investors on any developments in the strategic review. In the past, he hasn’t ruled out an acquisition of BlackBerry, while stressing that he’s more focused on striking a licensing deal or forging some other partnership. He said in January that he’s potentially open to licensing the new BlackBerry 10 software -- including to other handset makers, known as original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. “If OEMs come around and the business case makes sense as a whole, we would certainly consider it,” he said. “We’d not be prudent not to consider it.” To contact the reporter on this story: Hugo Miller in Toronto at  hugomiller@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Nick Turner at  nturner7@bloomberg.net",['Hugo Miller'],"BlackBerry Shares Jump as Lenovo CEO Mentions Possible Deal BlackBerry shares jumped the most in more than a month after Lenovo Group Ltd.

"HTC, Apple, Omni-ID, Avalanche: Intellectual Property",['Victoria Slind-Flor'],2013-03-11 10:57:29,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/htc-apple-omni-id-avalanche-intellectual-property.html,"HTC Corp. (2498) won dismissal of two Nokia Oyj (NOK) patent-infringement lawsuits in Germany , the first rulings from that country in the global intellectual-property dispute between the companies. The judges didn’t find that HTC violated Nokia’s patents, Joachim Bock, spokesman for the Mannheim Regional Court, which heard the cases, said in an interview March 8. In one of the actions, Nokia argued HTC illicitly used its technology to run Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Play store on its smartphones. Nokia last year sued HTC, BlackBerry and ViewSonic Corp. in the U.S., U.K. and Germany over a total of 45 patents. The Finnish mobile-phone maker, struggling to reverse a slide in sales, settled with BlackBerry in December. A month earlier, HTC reached a global settlement with Apple Inc. (AAPL) of their patent disputes. Nokia can appeal the March 8 ruling. “Nokia respectfully disagrees with the court’s decision and we are considering our options,” Mark Durrant, spokesman for the Espoo, Finland-based company, said in an e-mailed statement. Nokia asserted violation of more than 30 further patents against HTC in Germany, the U.S. and the U.K. and expects to prevail regarding those, he said. “Nokia has exaggerated the scope of its patent in order to extract unwarranted licensing royalties from Android handset manufacturers,” HTC said in an e-mailed statement referring to Google’s mobile software. “The Android platform is now safe from oppressive enforcement of this patent.” Google supported Taiwan ’s HTC as a party in the case over the Play store, which allows Android device users to download applications and media. The Mannheim court is scheduled to rule March 19 on whether HTC infringed a Nokia patent for technology used to regulate a device’s battery power use. Apple Objects to Second Samsung Patent Lawsuit Being Put on Hold Apple Inc. objected to the possibility that proceedings in a patent lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) scheduled for trial in 2014 will be put on hold while an appeals court reviews an August verdict in an earlier case. The objection, filed March 7 in federal court in San Jose , California , was in response to U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh’s inquiry at a hearing last month. The judge said she was skeptical of the need for both cases to proceed, especially while the first case is being appealed. On March 1, Koh reduced a jury’s $1.05 billion damages award to Apple in the first case by $450.5 million. The jury based its award for 14 Samsung products on an incorrect legal theory, Koh ruled. She said the companies should consider appealing her decision before any damages trial begins. “This case must proceed now, in order to stop the ongoing sales -- and relentless launch -- of Samsung’s latest infringing devices, which have caused, and every day continue to cause, continuing harm to Apple,” the Cupertino, California-based company said in the filing. Samsung said in the same filing, a joint report filed with Apple, that it agrees with the judge that the second case should be put on hold to “promote judicial economy.” The lawsuit was filed last year and covers technology in newer smartphones made by both companies, including Samsung’s Galaxy S III and Apple’s iPhone 5. Apple is challenging a decision by Koh that allows Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung to continue selling some products that were found by the jury to infringe Apple patents. In a Feb. 12 filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington , Apple said that Samsung has taken market share based on its “deliberate copying of Apple’s innovative iPhone and iPad products” and asked the court to halt the sales. In the March 8 filing, Samsung said staying the more recent case will “allow the parties to attempt to reach a business resolution of their disputes.” The earlier case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-cv-01846, and the case scheduled for trial next year is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 12-cv-00630, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). Omni-ID Says Xerafy Infringes Patents for RFID ‘On-Metal’ Tags Omni-ID Cayman Ltd., a maker of radio-frequency identification tags, sued a competitor for patent infringement. In the suit filed in federal court in Camden, New Jersey , Hong Kong-based Xerafy is accused of infringing two patents related to what are known as “on-metal” tags. Rochester, New York ’s Omni-ID claims in its pleadings that to no avail it sent Xerafy cease-and-desist notices related to the two patents in 2012. The company said in a statement that it began a program last year for the licensing of the two disputed patents. Company Chief Executive Officer George E. Daddis Jr. said that “unfortunately, even with the launch of our licensing program, we are still seeing many on-metal products being sold today that are clearly utilizing these foundational technologies owned by Omni-ID.” In dispute are patents 7,880,619, issued in February 2011, and 7,768,400, issued in August. Omni-ID asked the court for an order barring further infringement, and for awards of money damages, attorney fees and litigation costs.

LVMH’s MHCS SCS unit claims the auctioneer is infringing marks related to its Rheims, France-based Krug Champagne house, according to the South China Post. The Champagne-maker seeks a court order barring Acker Merrall Asia from using the marks in connection with products not made by MHCS SCS and also seeks money damages, the newspaper reported. The auction house, which didn’t respond immediately the Hong Kong newspaper’s request for comment, has held wine auctions there that have brought record princes for French wines, including a case of CH.

According to a March 5 entry in the Official Journal of the European Union, “ Salame Felino ” is now protected, although Belgium, Germany and France had initially objected to some of the details included in the description of the item. In order to be designated “Salame Felino,” the sausage must be produced from specific breeds of pigs, and the meat must come from specific parts of the animal. The sausage must be placed into natural hog casing, tied with twine, and must be free of lactose and powdered milk. According to the journal entry, references to such sausage dates back to the first century, and it was “well known” by the Bourbons. A frieze depicting the sausage can be found in the decorations of the Baptistery of Parma , which dates as far back as 1196. For more trademark news, click here. Copyright Keith Haring Foundation Claims Miami Exhibit Is Showing Fakes The foundation that holds the intellectual property rights of the late artist Keith Haring filed a copyright and trademark infringement lawsuit over an art show in Miami. Haring, who is best known for his cartoon-line “ Radiant Baby ” images, was a social activist and artist who died of AIDS in 1990 at the age of 31. According to the complaint filed in federal court March 8, most of the works exhibited at the Haring Miami show, held this past weekend in Miami’s Moore Building, were “fakes, forgeries, counterfeits and/or infringements.” According to the complaint, the exhibition catalog contains a disclaimer that some of the work being shown “has not been submitted or examined by the Keith Haring Foundation for authenticity.” The foundation says this disclaimer fails to note that many of the works had been submitted for authentication and were found to be inauthentic. A representative of the New York-based Keith Haring Foundation attended the show’s March 6 opening night and found that of the four floors of exhibited works “approximately 8 works were real works of Haring.” Many who attended the show “believed the art being displayed was by Keith Haring ,” according to court papers. The foundation claims that of about 80 paintings in the show, only one was an authentic work by Haring. “Each of these works of art, if they were really Haring works, would be worth in the range of $500,000 to $1 million,” according to the complaint. Putting these works into the market “will cause enormous and irreparable damage” to its reputation, the foundation said. The foundation said that for the most part, “they are poor quality fake Harings.” The foundation says it is harmed by the actions of the show’s promoters, and asked the court to bar the defendants from advertising, displaying, selling or offering for sale any works not created by Haring that “bear any indicia of Keith Haring.” Additionally, it asked for impoundment and destruction of the allegedly infringing works, awards of profits the defendants acquired relative to the infringement and for money damages, attorney fees and litigation costs. Herman J. Rossomanno III, a Miami-based lawyer for the show’s organizers, said in an e-mail that his clients and the foundation came to an agreement that the show was able to exhibit 10 pieces of Keith Haring artwork. The case is The Keith Haring Foundation Inc. v. Colored Thumb Corp., 1:13-cv-20830, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida (Miami). Avalanche Studios’ Founder Down on Some Anti-Piracy Technologies The founder of the Swedish game development company Avalanche Studios thinks many elements of digital-rights management technology are more harmful than helpful, the Gaming Bolt computer-game news website reported. Christofer Sundberg told Gaming Bolt that digital-rights systems that limit the players’ game experience shouldn’t be used. He said such systems make game developers look greedy and treat the game’s fans like criminals, according to Gaming Bolt. At the same time, Sundberg acknowledged to Gaming Bolt that piracy can inhibit game development, saying developers deserve to be paid for what he says is years of hard work.

To contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Hytha at  mhytha@bloomberg.net .",['Victoria Slind-Flor'],"HTC, Apple, Omni-ID, Avalanche: Intellectual Property HTC Corp. (2498) won dismissal of two Nokia Oyj (NOK) patent-infringement lawsuits in Germany , the first rulings from that country in the global intellectual-property dispute between the companies. The judges didn’t find that HTC violated Nokia’s patents, Joachim Bock, spokesman for the Mannheim Regional Court, which heard the cases, said in an interview March 8. In one of the actions, Nokia argued HTC illicitly used its technology to run Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Play store on its smartphones. Nokia last year sued HTC, BlackBerry and ViewSonic Corp. in the U.S., U.K. and Germany over a total of 45 patents. The Finnish mobile-phone maker, struggling to reverse a slide in sales, settled with BlackBerry in December. A month earlier, HTC reached a global settlement with Apple Inc. (AAPL) of their patent disputes. Nokia can appeal the March 8 ruling. “Nokia respectfully disagrees with the court’s decision and we are considering our options,” Mark Durrant, spokesman for the Espoo, Finland-based company, said in an e-mailed statement. Nokia asserted violation of more than 30 further patents against HTC in Germany, the U.S. and the U.K. and expects to prevail regarding those, he said. “Nokia has exaggerated the scope of its patent in order to extract unwarranted licensing royalties from Android handset manufacturers,” HTC said in an e-mailed statement referring to Google’s mobile software. “The Android platform is now safe from oppressive enforcement of this patent.” Google supported Taiwan ’s HTC as a party in the case over the Play store, which allows Android device users to download applications and media. The Mannheim court is scheduled to rule March 19 on whether HTC infringed a Nokia patent for technology used to regulate a device’s battery power use. Apple Objects to Second Samsung Patent Lawsuit Being Put on Hold Apple Inc. objected to the possibility that proceedings in a patent lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) scheduled for trial in 2014 will be put on hold while an appeals court reviews an August verdict in an earlier case. The objection, filed March 7 in federal court in San Jose , California , was in response to U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh’s inquiry at a hearing last month. The judge said she was skeptical of the need for both cases to proceed, especially while the first case is being appealed. On March 1, Koh reduced a jury’s $1.05 billion damages award to Apple in the first case by $450.5 million. The jury based its award for 14 Samsung products on an incorrect legal theory, Koh ruled. She said the companies should consider appealing her decision before any damages trial begins. “This case must proceed now, in order to stop the ongoing sales -- and relentless launch -- of Samsung’s latest infringing devices, which have caused, and every day continue to cause, continuing harm to Apple,” the Cupertino, California-based company said in the filing. Samsung said in the same filing, a joint report filed with Apple, that it agrees with the judge that the second case should be put on hold to “promote judicial economy.” The lawsuit was filed last year and covers technology in newer smartphones made by both companies, including Samsung’s Galaxy S III and Apple’s iPhone 5. Apple is challenging a decision by Koh that allows Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung to continue selling some products that were found by the jury to infringe Apple patents. In a Feb. 12 filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington , Apple said that Samsung has taken market share based on its “deliberate copying of Apple’s innovative iPhone and iPad products” and asked the court to halt the sales. In the March 8 filing, Samsung said staying the more recent case will “allow the parties to attempt to reach a business resolution of their disputes.” The earlier case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-cv-01846, and the case scheduled for trial next year is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 12-cv-00630, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). Omni-ID Says Xerafy Infringes Patents for RFID ‘On-Metal’ Tags Omni-ID Cayman Ltd., a maker of radio-frequency identification tags, sued a competitor for patent infringement. In the suit filed in federal court in Camden, New Jersey , Hong Kong-based Xerafy is accused of infringing two patents related to what are known as “on-metal” tags. Rochester, New York ’s Omni-ID claims in its pleadings that to no avail it sent Xerafy cease-and-desist notices related to the two patents in 2012. The company said in a statement that it began a program last year for the licensing of the two disputed patents. Company Chief Executive Officer George E. Daddis Jr. said that “unfortunately, even with the launch of our licensing program, we are still seeing many on-metal products being sold today that are clearly utilizing these foundational technologies owned by Omni-ID.” In dispute are patents 7,880,619, issued in February 2011, and 7,768,400, issued in August. Omni-ID asked the court for an order barring further infringement, and for awards of money damages, attorney fees and litigation costs. Xerafy didn’t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for comment. The case is Omni-ID USA Inc., v. Xerafy, 1:13-cv-00801-NLH- AMD, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Camden).

(AAPL) will outline what it plans to do with a growing pile of cash by next month, according to Howard Ward, chief investment officer at Gamco Investors Inc. (GBL)  Apple, which has been grappling with investor criticism over the handling of its $137.1 billion in cash and investments , will add $42 billion in earnings to that sum in 2013, Ward said. Greenlight Capital Inc.’s David Einhorn has been urging Cupertino, California-based Apple to issue high-yielding preferred shares to spread the funds among investors. Investors are also urging Apple to consider a higher dividend payout. “We’re going to get an announcement from the company as to how they intend to reallocate some of their cash,” Ward said in an interview today on Bloomberg Radio ’s “Surveillance” with Tom Keene. “They will put a floor under their stock at a higher price than it is today.” Apple climbed 1.4 percent to $437.87 at the close in New York, leaving the shares down 18 percent this year, compared with an 9.1 percent increase in the S&P 500 Index. Keith Goddard , president of Capital Advisors Inc., said Apple will probably announce a dividend or buyback by the end of the year, possibly as early as April, when the company is scheduled to release second-quarter earnings. “It really is mind-boggling to me that they’re being so stubborn about sitting on so much cash,” said Goddard, who said his firm owns 23,100 Apple shares. Apple has said it’s in active discussions over how to manage the cash, and that it’s considering buybacks, a bigger dividend among other options. Ward compared Apple’s shares to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) stock a year ago, after the bank announced a multibillion-dollar loss at the hands of one trader. “The stock was beaten up and it was at 30 dollars a share, and now it’s 50,” he said. Apple is the largest holding in Gamco’s (GBL) fund, Ward said.

Apple Buyers Make IPhone 5 Trackable With Police Help,['Chris Dolmetsch'],2012-09-21 18:32:15,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/apple-buyers-make-iphone-5s-traceable-with-new-york-police-help.html,"The New York City Police Department stationed officers at Apple Inc. (AAPL) stores as the iPhone 5 went on sale to help buyers register their new devices so they can be traced if stolen. The NYPD’s Community Affairs Bureau today deployed officers at the company’s six New York City stores, as well as seven Verizon Wireless and eight AT&T Inc. (T) locations, where they will register serial numbers of new devices along with the owner’s name and contact information, according to a statement. Earlier this year, the NYPD deployed patrol officers with technology that allows them to locate stolen iPhones and other stolen Apple products and apprehend those responsible, and officers have used the technology on their personal phones to recover property and make arrests. “I’m glad they’re there,” said Jessica Mellow, 27, a model and artist who was one of the first 10 people in line this morning at the Apple Store on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue. “I’ve had three phones stolen.” Paul Browne , an NYPD spokesman, didn’t immediately respond to inquiries about how many devices officers have registered today. Apple, based in Cupertino, California , is poised for a record iPhone 5 debut and may not be able to keep up with demand as customers lined up in Sydney, Tokyo , Paris and New York to pick up the latest model of its top-selling product. Global sales started at the Apple Store in Sydney’s George Street, and began in New York at 8 a.m. local time. With a new wireless contract, the device costs $199, $299 or $399 in the U.S., depending on the amount of memory. Largest Debut The crowds reinforce estimates from analysts that the iPhone 5 will be the largest consumer-electronics debut in history. Apple may sell as many as 10 million iPhones during the weekend sales rush, according to Gene Munster , an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. (PJC)  More than 250 of the devices were stolen from a store in London about seven hours before they were scheduled to go on sale, Metropolitan Police said. About 190 were taken from three outlets in western Japan’s Osaka prefecture earlier today, Kyodo News reported, citing the police. Metropolitan Police issued images of a 23-year-old man who works as an assistant at the 02 Store in the Tandem Centre in Wimbledon in connection with the London thefts, according to a statement. Tennessee Theft In Tennessee , a team of at least eight thieves used three stolen vehicles to break into a Best Buy Co. (BBY) store in Murfreesboro this week and steal more than $100,000 worth of electronics, mostly Apple products, said Kyle Evans, a spokesman for the city’s police department. They didn’t get any iPhone 5s, he said. “We believe that’s what the thieves were targeting because that’s a location where they would have been kept,” Evans said in a telephone interview. Murfreesboro police believe the theft may be related to similar burglaries that occurred throughout the country in the past week, in places including Knoxville, Tennessee, Florida and California, and are working with investigators in those states, Evans said. New York police have stepped up enforcement against thefts of Apple products during the past year. Last month, officers from the department’s Transit Bureau conducting a decoy operation arrested two teenagers after they stole an iPhone from one of the officers’ backpacks. ‘Drove Spike’ Apple’s “Find My iPhone” application allows users to find and protect their iPhones, iPads and Mac computers through another device or by logging on to the Internet. “The theft of Apple phones and other hand-held devices drove the spike in robberies and larceny this year,” Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said in a statement. “Individuals alert to their surroundings are less likely to become victims, and Operation ID will help those whose property is lost or stolen to get it back,” To contact the reporter on this story: Chris Dolmetsch in New York at  cdolmetsch@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Hytha at  mhytha@bloomberg.net",['Chris Dolmetsch'],"Apple Buyers Make IPhone 5 Trackable With Police Help The New York City Police Department stationed officers at Apple Inc.

(AAPL) trimmed its advance and financial shares slumped. The euro and Greek bonds advanced. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost less than 0.1 percent to 1,460.15 at 4 p.m. in New York  after gaining as much as 0.5 percent. The euro appreciated 0.1 percent to $1.2983 and Greek 10-year rates fell below 20 percent for the first time since March. Oil rose, trimming the biggest weekly loss in more than three months. Ten-year Treasury yields lost one basis point to 1.75 percent, erasing earlier gains. Apple, the largest company by market value, ended the day up 0.2 percent after rallying as much as 0.9 percent in morning trading as the company began selling its iPhone 5. S&P 500 financial shares lost 0.3 percent and were the biggest drag on the index among 10 industries. Futures and options contracts expire today, a process known as quadruple witching, and investors also prepared for S&P’s quarterly index rebalancing. “The market is trying to catch its breath,” Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond, Virginia , which oversees about $47 billion, said in a telephone interview. “We’ve had a pretty good run and, in the absence of incremental news, investors are resetting their portfolios.” Trading of S&P 500 companies was 55 percent higher than the 30-day average. The index ended the week down 0.4 percent and is up 16 percent this year, having climbed last week to the highest level since 2007. Fund Flows Global equity funds lured the largest weekly inflows this year, Citigroup Inc. said, after the U.S. Federal Reserve unveiled another round of quantitative easing and the European Central Bank pledged to buy bonds to contain the debt crisis. McDonald’s Corp., AT&T Inc., General Electric Co. and Exxon Mobil Corp. lead gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , while Coca-Cola Co., Alcoa Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. were among the worst performers. The Dow slipped 17.46 points to 13,579.47 and lost 0.1 percent this week. Expedia Inc. rallied 4 percent after the stock was rated buy in new coverage at Cantor Fitzgerald LP. Darden Restaurants Inc. climbed 4.6 percent after the world’s largest casual dining chain operator reported earnings that topped estimates amid improving sales at Olive Garden. The U.S. is the most attractive stock market because of the strength of corporate balance sheets, low interest rates and valuations, said billionaire investor Michael Price , president of MFP Investors LLC, who made his reputation as a value investor in the 1980s by buying shares of beaten-down lenders and running some of the best-performing U.S. mutual funds. ‘Place to Invest’ “With these interest rate levels and our PEs and our cash on the balance sheets and America being the place to invest in the world, where else do you want to go?” Price said in a “Bloomberg Surveillance” interview with Tom Keene and Sara Eisen. “I think it’s very early for European stocks.” The S&P 500, the benchmark gauge of U.S. equities, trades for about 14.9 times its companies’ reported earnings , compared with an average price-to-earnings multiple of about 16.3 since 1954. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) rose 0.5 percent, trimming this week’s decline to less than 0.1 percent. Vedanta Resources Plc climbed 3 percent and Swiss Life Holding AG gained 2.4 percent. European policy makers will unveil a financial bailout program for Spain as early as next week, the Financial Times said. Greek Yields Greek 10-year yields slid 62 basis points to 19.93 percent. A report of Greece ’s progress by the so-called troika of inspectors from the euro area, ECB and International Monetary Fund won’t be delayed until after the U.S. election, a Greek finance ministry official said. The official, who asked not to be identified, spoke as Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras began a meeting on budget plans with the officials in Athens today. The S&P GSCI gauge of 24 commodities rose 0.9 percent, paring the drop for this week to 4.4 percent, the first weekly decline since July. Gains today were led by natural gas, coffee and wheat. Oil for November delivery advanced 0.5 percent to $92.89 a barrel in New York. Wheat gained 2 percent after Russia’s Economy Minister Andrei Belousov said the nation may consider limiting grain exports if domestic prices keep rising. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) increased 0.8 percent, paring its first weekly drop this month. India ’s Sensex rallied 2.2 percent after the government changed tax rules on overseas loans, extending policy reforms announced last week, and the third-biggest party pledged to support the government. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies increased 1 percent. Turkey’s benchmark gauge jumped 1.3 percent led by Turkiye Is Bankasi AS as the country’s biggest bank by assets cut provisions for bad loans.

European Stocks Gain on Spain Bailout Speculation,['Namitha Jagadeesh'],2012-09-21 15:52:56,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/european-stock-futures-gain-on-spain-bailout-speculation.html,"European stocks rose to a one-week high after a report said that policy makers will next week unveil an economic reform program for Spain that will allow the country to seek a bailout. Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB) climbed 1.3 percent after UBS AG advised investors to buy the shares. Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) gained 2 percent after Barclays Plc raised its price target on the stock. Elan Corp. increased 2 percent after the company named a new chief operating officer. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) advanced 0.5 percent to 275.78 in London , the highest since Sept. 14. The gauge has rallied 18 percent from this year’s low on June 4 as central banks from Europe to the U.S. added stimulus measures to bolster the global economy. “Spain is the most critical country because all its economic actors -- individual companies, banks and states -- are indebted,” said Pierre Mouton, a portfolio manager who helps oversee $6 billion at Notz Stucki & Cie. in Geneva. “There’s market speculation of a bailout, though the official line is still that Spain won’t seek one. If the bond spreads widen again, that will accelerate a bailout process.” Futures and options contracts on equities indexes expired today, in a process known as quadruple witching. The volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 companies was 72 percent higher than the average of the past 30 days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. Spain Aid Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos is in talks with European Commission authorities to facilitate a new bailout program that will be presented Sept. 27, the Financial Times reported, citing unidentified officials involved in the discussions. The plan will focus on structural measures sought by the EU and not on new taxes or spending cuts, the FT said. Any additional conditions attached to an aid program for Spain will be “light,” as the current measures undertaken by the government are “sizable,” UniCredit SpA economist Tullia Bucco wrote in a note. Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said this week that the Mediterranean nation will consider seeking a bailout if the conditions imposed are acceptable. Italy and Spain won’t request aid unless they are unable to borrow from the market because of rising bond yields, Gianfranco Polillo, Italy’s undersecretary of finance said in an interview in Rome yesterday. The yield on Spain’s 10-year bonds fell two basis points this week to 5.76 percent. It rose above the 6 percent mark in intraday trading earlier in the week. Fed Rates In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota yesterday said the country’s central bank should hold interest rates near zero percent until unemployment drops below 5.5 percent. He reversed his view in May that the Fed may need to raise rates this year or the next. National benchmark indexes advanced in 13 of the 18 western-European markets. Germany ’s DAX gained 0.8 percent, France ’s CAC 40 added 0.6 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 was little changed. Novo Nordisk climbed 1.3 percent to 917 kroner after UBS raised the rating on the shares to buy from neutral. Vodafone added 2 percent to 178.45 pence after Barclays increased its share-price target to 200 pence from 195 pence and reiterated a buy recommendation. Elan rose 2 percent to 8.70 euros. Hans Peter Hasler will take over as chief operating officer from Oct. 1, the company said late yesterday. Hasler is currently the chairman of HBM BioVentures AG. Imagination, Devgen Imagination Technologies Group Plc (IMG) added 3.9 percent to 531.5 pence, paring a 13 percent loss seen in the four days through yesterday, after JPMorgan Chase & Co. listed it as one of the companies that will benefit from the product cycle of the iPhone 5 in the next 12 to 18 months. Apple Inc. began selling its latest version of the iPhone today. Devgen (DEVG) NV soared 69 percent to 15.89 euros, the biggest rally since it sold shares to the public in June 2005, after Syngenta AG offered to buy the company for 16 euros per share. That’s a 70 percent-premium to yesterday’s closing price of 9.43 euros. Rhoen-Klinikum AG (RHK) jumped 3.6 percent to 15.13 euros after Manager Magazin reported that Sana Kliniken AG was preparing a bid for the German hospital operator.

Apple Loses German Court Ruling Against Samsung in Patent Suit,['Jun Yang' 'Karin Matussek'],2012-09-21 12:19:21,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/apple-loses-german-court-ruling-against-samsung-in-patent-suit.html,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) lost a court ruling against Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) in Germany regarding claims the South Korean company’s Galaxy devices infringed patents on the iPhone maker’s touch-screen technology. The Mannheim Regional Court ruled that Samsung didn’t violate Apple’s patents on features related to touch-screen technology, Jason Kim, a Seoul-based spokesman for the Suwon, South Korea-based company said in an e-mailed statement today. Joachim Bock, a court spokesman, confirmed the ruling. Samsung and Apple, the world’s two biggest smartphone makers, have traded victories in their patent disputes fought over four continents since the Cupertino, California-based company last year accused Asia’s biggest electronics maker of “slavishly copying” its devices. The companies, competing for dominance of the global smartphone market estimated by Bloomberg Industries at $219 billion last year, are fighting patent battles even as Apple remains Samsung’s biggest customer. “We welcome today’s ruling, which affirms our position that our products do not infringe Apple’s intellectual property,” Samsung said in a statement today. “We will continue to further develop and introduce products that enhance the lives of German consumers.” The Mannheim judges also today rejected a bid by Apple regarding the same patent against Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Motorola Mobility Holdings unit. Alan Hely, a spokesman for Apple in London, declined to comment on the court ruling. California, Japan Next to Munich and Dusseldorf, Mannheim is one of the three prime court venues in Germany where lawyers for Apple, Samsung, Motorola Mobility and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) meet regularly in the current court fights. A federal jury in San Jose , California , on Aug. 24 found the South Korean company copied the iPhone and iPad and awarded Apple more than $1 billion in damages. A week later in Japan , Apple lost a suit as a Tokyo judge ruled that Samsung smartphones and a tablet didn’t infringe on an Apple invention for synchronizing music and video data with servers. Apple accounts for about 9 percent of Samsung’s revenue, making it the company’s largest customer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Today’s cases are LG Mannheim 7 O 337/11 (Apple v. Samsung) and 7 O 528/11 (Apple v. Motorola Mobility).

(ASTI) , the U.S. solar company that fell the most on record yesterday, will ship a sun-powered charging case for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone 5 in December as it continues its transition to consumer electronics, Chief Executive Officer Victor Lee said. The company is pursuing a “total paradigm shift” to focus on selling products to consumers instead of developers of large- scale solar power plants , said Lee, who was hired as CEO of the Thornton, Colorado-based company in February. A watt of solar cells installed on a consumer device sells for more than a watt installed on a rooftop, insulating the company from thinning margins as prices for photovoltaic panels fall, Lee said in an interview yesterday. “By going downstream we are actually going up the entire value chain,” Lee said. The company’s shares fell a record 29 percent yesterday after it said it will raise about $11 million in a secondary offering. Ascent was unchanged at $1.20 at the close today in New York. The funds will help Ascent expand its distribution network and promote its solar chargers, Lee said. He is also executive director of Shenzhen, China-based TFG Radiant Investment Group Ltd., which owns 39 percent of Ascent. Lee dates the company’s shift to consumer electronics to June, when Ascent announced its first solar charging case for Apple’s iPhone 4 model. Those products began shipping this month and he expects the company to be profitable by the third quarter of 2013, with consumer products generating as much as 80 percent of revenue.

Redbox-Verizon Streaming to Challenge Netflix by Year-End,['Cliff Edwards' 'Michael White'],2012-09-22 04:00:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/redbox-verizon-streaming-to-start-in-time-for-christmas.html,"Coinstar Inc. (CSTR) ’s Redbox and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , providing details of their challenge to Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , will offer subscription streaming, movie sales and rentals by Christmas, along with DVDs from the local kiosk. Redbox Instant by Verizon, being tested in the homes of about 500 Verizon employees, initially will focus solely on newer movies that have been available for sale and rental, Eric Bruno, Verizon’s vice president of strategy and planning for consumer and mass business markets, said yesterday in an interview. The venture, 65 percent owned by Verizon, will battle Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) for the growing number of consumers who watch movies and television shows online and on devices like Apple Inc.’s iPhone. The U.S. market for subscription streaming rose fivefold to $1.1 billion in the first half of 2012 from a year earlier, according to data from the Hollywood studio-backed Digital Entertainment Group. Verizon and Bellevue, Washington-based Coinstar are focused on a streaming network “that can stand on its own against Netflix, against Amazon,” Bruno said. Netflix, based in Los Gatos , California, had 24 million U.S. customers of its $7.99 a month subscription streaming service as of June 30, by far the largest competitor. Amazon, the Seattle-based online retailer, offers free two-day shipping and access to 25,000 movies and TV shows for $79 a year. It doesn’t disclose its subscribers. Online Rentals Redbox Instant was announced earlier this year. In addition to a monthly subscription and an allotment of DVDs from Coinstar’s almost 40,000 kiosks, it will offer a la carte movie rentals online and purchases for download, Bruno said. Customers will be able to download titles to mobile devices, game consoles and set-top boxes through an application that will be available at Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s app store, Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android store and other marketplaces, he said. While there’s no specific date, the venture is targeting a start to the service between late November and mid-December, after a short period of initial public testing, Bruno said. Coinstar has previously said that the service is targeted to start before year-end. Coinstar and Verizon will pay content providers based on the number of subscribers, similar to traditional cable-TV systems, rather than a set payment, Bruno said. Netflix has paid a set amount for streaming rights to movies over a specific period of time, a model that increases the pressure to attract new subscribers. Redbox Instant hasn’t announced pricing. In August, Coinstar Chief Executive Officer Paul Davis said the venture will focus on “value” pricing. Coinstar rose 1.3 percent $46.52 yesterday in New York. It has gained 1.9 percent this year. Verizon, based in New York, climbed 0.3 percent to $45.64 and has added 14 percent in 2012.

"Fox, Dish Face Off Over Ad-Free Primetime TV Service",['Edvard Pettersson'],2012-09-22 02:19:35,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/fox-dish-to-face-off-over-ad-free-primetime-television-service.html,"News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox Broadcasting unit asked a federal judge to block Dish Network Corp. (DISH) ’s ad-free primetime television service, which the networks say threatens their business. U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles heard arguments today on Fox’s bid to halt Dish’s PrimeTime Anytime and AutoHop features while it proceeds with its copyright- infringement lawsuit filed in May. The judge took the request under submission without indicating when she would issue a decision. Fox Broadcasting Co., Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBCUniversal and CBS Corp. (CBS) separately sued Dish, the No. 2 U.S. satellite-television provider, claiming the service will destroy the “advertising supported ecosystem” that provides free, over-the-air primetime television. Dish sued the networks in New York , seeking a court ruling that it isn’t infringing copyrights. Richard Stone, a lawyer for Fox, said at the hearing that other distributors, including DirecTV (DTV) , the largest U.S. satellite-television provider, will be forced to follow suit if Dish’s ad-free primetime television service isn’t blocked. “It will grow like a brushfire if it isn’t stopped,” Stone said. The Dish service will devalue commercial time during Fox’s programs in the eyes of advertisers, the lawyer said. The service also directly competes with Fox’s own distribution of ad-free programs through Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iTunes and through Amazon.com Inc., Stone said. Plain ‘Theft’ “This is theft of programming, plain and simple,” Stone told the judge. Annette Hurst, a lawyer for Dish, said Fox was trying to undo the 1984 Supreme Court ruling in the Sony Betamax case that allowed consumers to copy programs for later viewing. There was no way to distinguish between Dish’s AutoHop and fast forwarding through commercials for legal purposes, Hurst said. “This is not A Clockwork Orange” where viewers can be forced with their eyes pried open to watch commercials, Hurst said, referring to the 1971 Stanley Kubrick film. Dish, based in Englewood, Colorado , introduced its Hopper digital video recorder in March. It can record all the major networks’ primetime shows and store them for eight days after their initial broadcast. AutoHop, introduced in May, allows viewers, with the touch of a button, to skip all the commercials on recorded shows automatically, without having to fast-forward through them. Undermining Advertising Fox said in in its Aug. 22 request for an injunction that “PrimeTime Anytime and AutoHop cut the legs out from under the advertiser-supported broadcast television business model.” Dish said in its complaint that the AutoHop feature lets subscribers watch primetime shows commercial-free the day after they are recorded, not on the night when they’re first shown on television. Dish’s new service might affect the television networks’ ability to borrow money, with AutoHop having “broad negative credit implications across the television industry,” Neil Begley, an analyst for Moody’s Investors Service, said in a May 25 report cited by Fox in its filing. The case is Fox Broadcasting v. Dish Network , 12-4529, U.S. District Court, Central District of California ( Los Angeles ).

Microsoft Deploys College-Kid Cool in Windows 8 Apps Race: Tech,['Dina Bass'],2012-09-21 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/microsoft-deploys-college-kid-cool-in-windows-8-apps-race-tech.html,"Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is forging a future in tablets with students like Joe Shapiro, a computer science major who had never crafted applications for the company’s Windows software until he won an internship to try it out. Shapiro, a senior at Brown University , spent the summer in the Foundry paid internship program at Microsoft’s New England Research & Development Center , known as NERD. He helped build a commuter-transit app, Catch It, that should be available for download later this month in the online store for Windows 8, the new tablet-friendly version of Microsoft’s flagship operating system. And, crucial to Microsoft’s ambitions, he plans to make more apps. Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, designed Windows 8 for touch-screen technology included in the company’s first tablet, Surface, and other devices coming this year. To gain share in tablets, a market expected by DisplaySearch to reach $66.4 billion in 2012, Microsoft needs enough apps to challenge the more than 200,000 available for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad. “The apps ecosystem is probably the single most important factor in a customer’s experience,” said Al Hilwa, an analyst at market researcher IDC. “It dictates what books you read, what music you listen to, what movies you see, what social activities you take part in. Problem is, you can’t have half a million apps overnight.” Interns, also deployed to write prototype apps for the Windows 8 preview last year, produced six apps through Foundry, generating enough interest among computer science students for the company to make the pilot program permanent. Using student recruits is one way Microsoft can woo app developers who are used to building programs for mobile phones and tablets, where the company has little and no share, respectively. ‘College Struggle’ “Microsoft has struggled to get college kids interested in developing for Windows,” said Wes Miller, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, who is based in Kirkland, Washington. Luring programmers before graduation is particularly critical for recruitment in the U.S., which lags behind countries such as India and China in its ability to crank out qualified engineers. The U.S. ranks 23rd among developed nations in the percentage of students with undergraduate degrees in science or engineering who are employed in related fields, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported last year. The report analyzed employment trends for people age 25 to 34. Like their counterparts already in the workforce, student developers have focused programming efforts on apps for Apple’s iOS software, which powers the iPad, and Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system, used in an array of handheld devices, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s Kindle. Microsoft’s version of the Surface tablet that is most comparable to the iPad won’t be able to run older Windows apps, forcing developers to start from scratch. ‘Playing Catch-Up’ Windows 8 is the first Microsoft operating system that will work on computers running chips based on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology. These chips are widely used in mobile devices, including the iPad. The ARM-based products will run only apps designed specifically for the new version of Windows -- and none of the programs already available for Microsoft software on machines made for Intel Corp. (INTC) ’s chips. “Microsoft is definitely playing catch-up with respect to the global app marketplace,” said David Hilal, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, in an interview. “Their challenge is a chicken-and-egg problem. They need to get more users for their apps to entice developers, but they need better apps to attract more users.” Enter NERD interns to help fill the void. This summer’s group of 21 interns produced three apps already in the Windows store, and two more that are expected to follow soon. Intern-Built One of the intern-built apps is Trackage, which enables users to locate packages shipped by FedEx Corp. (FDX) , United Parcel Service Inc.

It uses facial-recognition software to generate videos out of a set of images -- think of it as a way to create a birthday or 50th- anniversary video without all the complicated editing or PowerPoint work. FaceReel was made by a team that included Jancarlo Perez and Jasmine Huynh, students at MIT who, like Shapiro, hadn’t worked on apps for Windows prior to the internship. They, too, plan to develop Windows apps again. Perez described the Windows 8 development environment as “fast and fluid,” echoing the oft-repeated phrase Microsoft executives have used to describe the program. App Exposure NERD interns who later opt for a career making apps for Microsoft may find it’s easier to get exposure for their work because the field isn’t as crowded as it is for apps built for Apple or Google operating systems, said Hilal, the FBR analyst. “As an app developer, you take a little bit of a leap of faith today with Microsoft,” Hilal said. “You can get a lot of downloads with Apple, but there’s a lot of competition.” Beyond fostering a desire to work at Microsoft, NERD aims to create a devoted group of Windows 8 converts who will spread their enthusiasm among fellow computer science majors and design students. “Because Windows 8 is pre-release, it’s been so exciting to get my hands on it before other people have been able to,” said Emily Lin, a media arts and sciences major at Wellesley College , who served as the designer on the Catch It team. “When I tell my friends, they say, ‘That’s so cool that you are getting to develop on Windows 8.’ ” To contact the reporter on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at  dbass2@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net",['Dina Bass'],"Microsoft Deploys College-Kid Cool in Windows 8 Apps Race: Tech Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is forging a future in tablets with students like Joe Shapiro, a computer science major who had never crafted applications for the company’s Windows software until he won an internship to try it out. Shapiro, a senior at Brown University , spent the summer in the Foundry paid internship program at Microsoft’s New England Research & Development Center , known as NERD. He helped build a commuter-transit app, Catch It, that should be available for download later this month in the online store for Windows 8, the new tablet-friendly version of Microsoft’s flagship operating system. And, crucial to Microsoft’s ambitions, he plans to make more apps. Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, designed Windows 8 for touch-screen technology included in the company’s first tablet, Surface, and other devices coming this year. To gain share in tablets, a market expected by DisplaySearch to reach $66.4 billion in 2012, Microsoft needs enough apps to challenge the more than 200,000 available for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad. “The apps ecosystem is probably the single most important factor in a customer’s experience,” said Al Hilwa, an analyst at market researcher IDC. “It dictates what books you read, what music you listen to, what movies you see, what social activities you take part in. Problem is, you can’t have half a million apps overnight.” Interns, also deployed to write prototype apps for the Windows 8 preview last year, produced six apps through Foundry, generating enough interest among computer science students for the company to make the pilot program permanent. Using student recruits is one way Microsoft can woo app developers who are used to building programs for mobile phones and tablets, where the company has little and no share, respectively. ‘College Struggle’ “Microsoft has struggled to get college kids interested in developing for Windows,” said Wes Miller, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, who is based in Kirkland, Washington. Luring programmers before graduation is particularly critical for recruitment in the U.S., which lags behind countries such as India and China in its ability to crank out qualified engineers. The U.S. ranks 23rd among developed nations in the percentage of students with undergraduate degrees in science or engineering who are employed in related fields, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported last year. The report analyzed employment trends for people age 25 to 34. Like their counterparts already in the workforce, student developers have focused programming efforts on apps for Apple’s iOS software, which powers the iPad, and Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system, used in an array of handheld devices, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s Kindle. Microsoft’s version of the Surface tablet that is most comparable to the iPad won’t be able to run older Windows apps, forcing developers to start from scratch. ‘Playing Catch-Up’ Windows 8 is the first Microsoft operating system that will work on computers running chips based on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology. These chips are widely used in mobile devices, including the iPad. The ARM-based products will run only apps designed specifically for the new version of Windows -- and none of the programs already available for Microsoft software on machines made for Intel Corp. (INTC) ’s chips. “Microsoft is definitely playing catch-up with respect to the global app marketplace,” said David Hilal, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, in an interview. “Their challenge is a chicken-and-egg problem. They need to get more users for their apps to entice developers, but they need better apps to attract more users.” Enter NERD interns to help fill the void. This summer’s group of 21 interns produced three apps already in the Windows store, and two more that are expected to follow soon. Intern-Built One of the intern-built apps is Trackage, which enables users to locate packages shipped by FedEx Corp. (FDX) , United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , the U.S. Postal Service and LaserShip Inc. using a single app rather than having to go to each service’s website separately.

(AAPL) ’s new iOS 6 operating system infringes a trademarked design for clocks in Swiss rail stations, according to state-owned railway operator SBB. The updated software, introduced this month by Apple, includes a clock icon with black and red hands that uses an SBB design created in 1944, Reto Kormann, a spokesman for the Swiss rail operator, said by telephone today. SBB, which has allowed companies such as watchmaker Mondaine Watch Ltd. to use the design under a license, said that it’s in discussions with Cupertino, California-based Apple about a license or a settlement that would allow the phonemaker to use the image, and expects to resolve the issue in the next few days, Kormann said. “The money isn’t in the front of our interests because we are proud that Apple took an SBB design,” Kormann said. “If we have a cooperation agreement between two good brands, that’s a win-win.” The disputed design appears only on the iPad and isn’t on the iPhone, said Adam Howorth, a spokesman for Apple in London. He had no further comment immediately. Samsung Conflict Separately, Apple has been embroiled in patent battles with smartphone maker Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) in courts across four continents after Apple accused the South Korean company of copying its devices last year. Apple lost a ruling against Samsung in Germany regarding claims that Galaxy devices infringed on Apple’s touch-screen technology, according to a court spokesman today. A federal jury in San Jose , California , on Aug. 24 found Samsung copied the iPhone and iPad and awarded Apple more than $1 billion in damages. A week later in Japan, Apple lost a suit as a Tokyo judge ruled that Samsung smartphones and a tablet didn’t infringe on an Apple invention for synchronizing music and video data with servers. The iPhone 5, which also uses the iOS 6 operating system, went on sale today and may sell more than 10 million devices in its opening weekend, Piper Jaffray Cos. analyst Gene Munster has predicted.

E-House Tops Biggest Loss in Two Months: China Overnight,['Belinda Cao' 'Leon Lazaroff'],2012-09-21 20:48:45,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/e-house-tops-biggest-loss-in-2-months-on-growth-china-overnight.html,"Chinese stocks traded in New York posted their first weekly decline in September and E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ) slumped on concern a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy will extend into next year. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN) of the most-traded Chinese shares in the U.S. added 0.7 percent to 91.88 at the close of trading yesterday, paring its loss this week to 2.2 percent. Internet real estate agent service provider E-House sank 17 percent this week as SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , China’s largest property information website, posted its biggest weekly retreat in a month. China Telecom Corp. (CHA) and China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (CHU) declined more than 5 percent for the week after growth in mobile-service users slowed. The economic slump may persist into next year amid a lack of funding for approved infrastructure projects, central bank adviser Song Guoqing said yesterday. His comment echoed a forecast by Yuan Gangming, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, who said Sept. 19 that expansion may slow for a ninth quarter to below 7 percent in the first three months of 2013. “We’re still underweighting the market, and I suspect it will tread water for a little while,” John-Paul Smith, Deutsche Bank AG’s emerging-market strategist, said by phone from London yesterday. “The underlying trend in the economy still looks to be fairly negative.” The iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese exchange-traded fund in the U.S., gained 0.7 percent to $34.75 yesterday, trimming its weekly slump to 1.3 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) was little changed at 1,460.15 as Apple Inc. (AAPL) started selling the iPhone 5 and a report said European officials will unveil a bailout plan for Spain. Economic Growth China will grow 7.3 percent to 7.4 percent in the fourth quarter and 7 percent to 7.5 percent in the first half of next year, Song, a Peking University professor, said in an interview in Beijing. He reiterated a July forecast of 7.4 percent for third-quarter growth. “There is no hard evidence now to say that there will be a rebound soon,” Song said. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) slid 4.6 percent this week, the most since the week ended Oct. 21, 2011, after escalating tensions with Japan threatened trade and a preliminary reading of a manufacturing index by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics signaled output may shrink for an 11th month in September. E-House, a provider of property agency services, fell to $4.67 after its biggest weekly decline since May. Youku Tudou Inc. (YOKU) , a video website that completed its merger with Tudou Holdings Inc. on Aug. 23, tumbled 11 percent to $18.57 in a week when The People’s Bank of China said it aims to emphasize price stability, raising concern it won’t make an additional cut in interest rates following those made in June and July. Federal Reserve The U.S. Federal Reserve’s third round of monetary easing reduces the options for China’s policy makers as it may add to inflationary pressure on the world’s second-largest economy, Industrial Securities Co. said in a Sept. 17 report. Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , the world’s largest solar-panel maker, gained 5.9 percent to $1.08 yesterday as the New York Stock Exchange warned the Wuxi, China-based company that it may be delisted from the market. Trading volume was twice the stock’s three-month daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The NYSE said the average closing price of Suntech’s ADRs was below $1 for 30 consecutive days as of Sept. 10, triggering a delisting warning. China Eastern Airlines Co. (CEA) , the nation’s second-largest carrier by passenger numbers, declined 2.2 percent yesterday to $15.35 as Citigroup analyst Vivian Tao said in an investor note that cancellations may rise during Golden Week, the national holiday that begins in early October, after Chinese tourists broke off as much as 40 percent of reservations to Japan.

U.S. Silica Open to Buying Mines to Meet Fracking Demand,['David Wethe'],2012-09-21 20:32:42,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/u-s-silica-open-to-buying-mines-to-meet-fracking-demand-growth.html,"U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. (SLCA) , the nation’s second-largest provider of hydraulic fracturing sand, is considering buying additional mines as it faces increasing demand for the material from energy producers. U.S. Silica has sold out of its fracking sand for the rest of the year and expects demand to increase as much as 20 percent a year, Chief Executive Officer Bryan Shinn said today in a telephone interview. The company, which plans to open its 14th plant in the first quarter, may need to buy new mines because the sand that works best for fracking can mainly be found in Illinois , Wisconsin and Minnesota , he said. “We want to continue to grow and add capacity,” Shinn said today in a telephone interview. “But I think as an industry, it’s going to be a challenge to be able to do that and meet the oil and gas demand.” U.S. Silica, based in Frederick, Maryland , sells the sand to oil and natural-gas producers who inject it with water and chemicals into wells to gain access to the fossil fuels. The company, which began supplying oil and gas producers in about 2008, also sells sand that ends up in everything from toothpaste to the glass on Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone, Shinn said. “Even though we’re a 112-year-old industrial minerals company, we have the growth curve of a tech startup,” he said. “We’re going to grow earnings by those targets more than 50 percent this year.” Add Capacity An increase in the demand for fracking sand was one of the reasons the company began trading publicly in January. U.S. Silica has fallen 18 percent since its debut. The company fell 1.6 percent to $14 at the close in New York. In many of the potential properties U.S. Silica has considered buying in the past, the costs were too high and the operations were spread too far. “We’ve gotten, over the last couple of years, all kinds of pitches from companies who’ve bought property or are in some phase of construction,” Shinn said. “We see a lot of candidates. Certainly if we find the right one, we’d think seriously about it.” Demand for fracking sand is expected to increase by 7.5 percent in 2013 to about 56 million tons, Senjit Sarkar, a project leader at PacWest Consulting Partners in Houston, said today in an e-mail. Supplies of sand are likely to increase by almost 25 percent next year, he wrote. Prices for fracking sand are expected to fall by a range of 5 to 7 percent in the next year, according to the e-mail.

"S&P 500 Erases Gains as Apple Rally Fades, Banks Fall",['Am' 'a Gould' 'Nikolaj Gammeltoft'],2012-09-21 21:20:15,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/u-s-stock-futures-rise-as-apple-gains-on-iphone-5-debut.html,"The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) erased gains, sending the benchmark index lower for the fourth time in five days, as a rally in Apple Inc. (AAPL) faded and banks retreated. Apple (AAPL) , which is forecast to sell 10 million iPhone 5s this weekend in the device’s debut, rose 0.2 percent after climbing as much as 0.9 percent. Materials producers, consumer staples, and bank stocks led losses in the S&P 500. Alcoa Inc. (AA) , Coca-Cola Co. and Bank of America Corp. slipped at least 0.8 percent. Research In Motion Ltd. (BB) declined 6.5 percent as its BlackBerry service suffered disruptions in Europe. “The market is trying to catch its breath,” Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond, Virginia , which oversees about $47 billion, said in a telephone interview. “We’ve had a pretty good run and, in the absence of incremental news, investors are resetting their portfolios.” The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1 percent to 1,460.15 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 17.46 points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,579.47. Today’s trading came amid the expiration of equity futures and options contracts, a process known as quadruple witching, as well as S&P’s quarterly index rebalancing. About 8.4 billion shares changed hands, 37 percent more than the three-month daily average. Global Slowdown The benchmark index for U.S. equities fell 0.4 percent this week as reports signaled global economies are slowing. The benchmark index has rallied 16 percent this year and last week closed at the highest level since 2007 after the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank announced monetary stimulus measures. The index trades for about 14.9 times its companies’ reported earnings, compared with an average price-to-earnings multiple of about 16.3 since 1954. “I think the market this week has clearly been digesting the gains of the previous several weeks,” Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co. in Radnor, Pennsylvania , said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees $6.5 billion in assets. Equities rose earlier today following a Financial Times report that Spain’s Economy Minister Luis de Guindos has held talks with the commission about a series of structural reforms that will be unveiled on Sept. 27. The newspaper cited unidentified officials involved in the discussions. The European Union needs Spain to meet specific conditions before it can authorize a full bailout. Spanish Relief “There may be some relief around Spain in particular, but there’s still the overhang of a deeper recession in many parts of Europe ,” Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares Inc., which manages $4.5 billion in Raleigh, North Carolina, said in a phone interview. Apple’s iPhone 5 success “is a sign that the consumer is capable of continuing to spend and it provides a positive boost toward the technology sector.” Apple added 0.2 percent to $700.10. The company may not be able to keep up with demand as customers lined up in Sydney, Tokyo , Paris and New York to pick up the latest model of its best-selling product. Deutsche Bank (DBK) increased its price forecast for the shares of the world’s biggest company to $850 from $775. Mobile-service carriers offering the iPhone gained. Sprint Nextel Corp.

Research In Motion slipped 6.5 percent to $6.46. Some BlackBerry users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa lost e- mail and Internet access, wireless carrier Vodafone Group Plc said. The disruptions, disclosed earlier today, have since been resolved, Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM said in an e-mailed statement. The Dow Jones Transportation Average (TRAN) decreased 1 percent today, completing its biggest weekly decline since November. The gauge of 20 shipping companies from FedEx Corp. to United Continental Holdings Inc. began slipping into a bear market three months before broader benchmark indexes in 2007 and peaked before the rest of the market when the technology bubble popped in 2000. Bank of America fell 0.9 percent to $9.11. Beverage producer Coca-Cola retreated 1.6 percent to $38.03, while Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum producer, slipped 1.3 percent to $9.13. Genworth Drops Genworth Financial Inc. lost 2.9 percent to $5.66. Acting Chief Executive Officer Martin Klein said the cost of defending its investment-grade status at Moody’s Investors Service may be more detrimental than a cut to junk, according to BTIG LLC. Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. (KORS) climbed 9.3 percent to $57.35 after increasing its forecasts for sales and profit this year as demand increases in North America and Europe. Expedia Inc. rallied 4 percent to $59.37 for the second- biggest gain in the S&P 500. The online travel company was rated buy in new coverage from Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. An index of homebuilder stocks rose for third straight day, gaining 1.7 percent. KB Home (KBH) , the Los Angeles-based homebuilder that targets first-time buyers, rose 16 percent to $15.26 after reporting a profit for its fiscal third quarter. KB Home benefited from tax and insurance-related gains, as well as higher sales amid a U.S. housing market recovery. Confidence among homebuilders climbed to the highest level in more than six years, the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo sentiment index showed this week. Single- family housing starts rose in August to the fastest annual rate since April 2010, the Commerce Department said Sept. 19. Price’s Picks The U.S. is the most attractive stock market because of the strength of corporate balance sheets, low interest rates and valuations, said billionaire investor Michael Price, who made his reputation as a value investor in the 1980s by buying shares of beaten-down lenders and running some of the best-performing U.S. mutual funds. “As the economy improves and as uncertainty from our election and China and all the European issues go away, American consumers have enormous pent-up demand,” Price said in a “Bloomberg Surveillance” interview with Tom Keene and Sara Eisen. “It’s very early for European stocks.” Price, president of MFP Investors LLC, said he’s bullish on J.C. Penney Co. because the U.S. retailer is “doing all the right things” and will benefit from rising demand among U.S. shoppers. J.C. Penney shares, which tumbled 11 percent yesterday, will rally amid a rebound in consumer spending when concerns about the global economy subside, said Price. He said the retailer is trading for about half of its “intrinsic value.” He also likes Citigroup Inc. (C) shares because they’re the cheapest among large U.S. banks, he said. J.C. Penney increased 0.2 percent to $25.89. Citigroup fell 0.4 percent to $33.67.

(AAPL) faded and banks retreated. Apple (AAPL) , which is forecast to sell 10 million iPhone 5s this weekend in the device’s debut, rose 0.2 percent after climbing as much as 0.9 percent. Materials producers, consumer staples, and bank stocks led losses in the S&P 500. Alcoa Inc. (AA) , Coca-Cola Co. and Bank of America Corp. slipped at least 0.8 percent. Research In Motion Ltd. (BB) declined 6.5 percent as its BlackBerry service suffered disruptions in Europe. “The market is trying to catch its breath,” Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond, Virginia , which oversees about $47 billion, said in a telephone interview. “We’ve had a pretty good run and, in the absence of incremental news, investors are resetting their portfolios.” The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1 percent to 1,460.15 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 17.46 points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,579.47. Today’s trading came amid the expiration of equity futures and options contracts, a process known as quadruple witching, as well as S&P’s quarterly index rebalancing. About 8.4 billion shares changed hands, 37 percent more than the three-month daily average. Global Slowdown The benchmark index for U.S. equities fell 0.4 percent this week as reports signaled global economies are slowing. The benchmark index has rallied 16 percent this year and last week closed at the highest level since 2007 after the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank announced monetary stimulus measures. The index trades for about 14.9 times its companies’ reported earnings, compared with an average price-to-earnings multiple of about 16.3 since 1954. “I think the market this week has clearly been digesting the gains of the previous several weeks,” Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co. in Radnor, Pennsylvania , said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees $6.5 billion in assets. Equities rose earlier today following a Financial Times report that Spain’s Economy Minister Luis de Guindos has held talks with the commission about a series of structural reforms that will be unveiled on Sept. 27. The newspaper cited unidentified officials involved in the discussions. The European Union needs Spain to meet specific conditions before it can authorize a full bailout. Spanish Relief “There may be some relief around Spain in particular, but there’s still the overhang of a deeper recession in many parts of Europe ,” Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares Inc., which manages $4.5 billion in Raleigh, North Carolina, said in a phone interview. Apple’s iPhone 5 success “is a sign that the consumer is capable of continuing to spend and it provides a positive boost toward the technology sector.” Apple added 0.2 percent to $700.10. The company may not be able to keep up with demand as customers lined up in Sydney, Tokyo , Paris and New York to pick up the latest model of its best-selling product. Deutsche Bank (DBK) increased its price forecast for the shares of the world’s biggest company to $850 from $775. Mobile-service carriers offering the iPhone gained. Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) jumped 3.9 percent to $5.65, while AT&T Inc. (T) increased 0.4 percent to $38.08 and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) added 0.3 percent to $45.64.

Lockhart Says More Fed Easing May Be Needed if Jobs Stall,['Steve Matthews'],2012-09-21 18:17:13,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/lockhart-says-more-fed-easing-may-be-needed-if-jobs-stall.html,"Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said the central bank may ease beyond its current plan to buy mortgage-backed securities if the labor market doesn’t show signs of greater strength. “MBS purchases will continue until we see a better employment situation,” Lockhart said today in a speech in Atlanta. “If we do not see improvement, more action may be taken. And inflation will be monitored closely and kept near 2 percent.” Lockhart, who votes on monetary policy this year, supported the Federal Open Market Committee’s Sept. 13 decision to expand its holdings of securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion in mortgage debt each month. The Fed, led by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke , aims through a third round of quantitative easing to boost growth and reduce 8.1 percent unemployment. “I hope the resolve of the FOMC is clear,” Lockhart said in a speech to the Atlanta Institute of Internal Auditors. “A stronger overall pace of recovery is central to improvement in the labor market.” The committee needed to act because of “discouraging conditions of slowing growth and still high unemployment with meager recent progress in bringing it down.” The Fed said last week that economic conditions would probably warrant holding the target interest rate near zero through at least mid-2015, extending a previous date of late 2014. Low interest rates will remain appropriate for a “considerable time” after growth strengthens, the central bank said. Near Zero Lockhart told reporters after his speech he was skeptical about a proposal made yesterday by Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota that the central bank should hold interest rates at around zero until unemployment drops below 5.5 percent. “My comment on that is 5.5 percent is much closer to current measures of full employment,” Lockhart said. “I am not so sure that it will not be appropriate to begin the process of tightening before we would get to what we would consider full employment. I don’t want to rule out that could be the case.” One option for additional Fed action would be purchases of Treasury securities , though such a step isn’t desirable now, Lockhart said to reporters. “Taking stock of the situation will be appropriate early next year,” he said. U.S. stocks rose, paring the week’s loss for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as investors watched for developments on Europe’s debt crisis and Apple Inc. started selling the iPhone 5. The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent to 1,463.48 at 2:15 p.m. in New York. Not Enough Lockhart said the economy has been expanding at a rate of less than 2 percent recently, not enough to reduce unemployment significantly. Gross domestic product climbed at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter, down from 2 percent in the first quarter and 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. The Atlanta Fed official said the choice of mortgage- backed-securities for purchases was well timed because the housing market is starting to show improvement. “By maintaining downward pressure on mortgage rates and by encouraging growth of mortgage-financed purchase activity, sales activity in the Southeast and nationwide should accelerate, and upward pressure on home prices should contribute to consumer confidence ,” he said. “The policy action should have positive sector-specific effects with spillover to general conditions.” Some “headwinds” remain, Lockhart said, including the European debt crisis and the so-called fiscal cliff, the $600 billion of tax increases and spending cuts that will kick in automatically at the end of the year unless Congress acts. The Congressional Budget Office said in an Aug. 22 economic report that fiscal tightening of that magnitude could cause a recession. Lockhart, a former Georgetown University professor, has led the Atlanta Fed since 2007. The regional bank is responsible for Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and portions of Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee.

HP’s Whitman Said Planning Cloud-to-Tablet Push for Growth,['Aaron Ricadela'],2012-09-22 06:25:21,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/hp-s-whitman-said-planning-cloud-to-tablet-push-to-revive-growth.html,"Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman is betting that refining the company’s existing strategy, rather than making radical shifts, will help reverse the fortunes of the struggling computer maker. Whitman, a year into the CEO job, plans to sharpen the company’s focus on corporate clients with a new product lineup that includes software and tablets for businesses and a machine that combines storage, computing and networking, according to people familiar with the matter. She’ll explain her approach to analysts Oct. 3 in San Francisco, said the people, who requested anonymity because the plans are private. Whitman is seeking to reverse a slump that has sliced revenue for four straight quarters. Her challenge will be convincing investors that the evolutionary approach is enough to withstand threats from EMC Corp., Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) in the growing market for products that deliver computing over the Internet. “There’s a huge movement toward using the cloud as the platform, and it’s going to be hard for HP to compete,” said Joshua Greenbaum, an analyst and principal of Enterprise Applications Consulting. “IBM and Oracle have made integration of hardware and software a key to their strategy.” Whitman’s task is to shore up investors’ confidence in a company wracked by two years of management upheaval, accelerating competition and acquisitions gone awry. Whitman took the reins last September from Leo Apotheker , whose 10-month tenure was marked by strategy shifts and sales-forecast shortfalls. Cloud Business “They need to restructure the firm,” said Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “All in, 80 percent of their business could decline.” Hewlett-Packard fell less than 1 percent to $17.59 at the close in New York. Shares of the Palo Alto , California-based company have declined 32 percent this year. In its drive to help customers building out data centers to handle cloud computing, Hewlett-Packard is developing a system that combines server computers, data storage and networking components in the same device, the people said. It will run Intel Corp. chips and software from such providers as IBM and SAP AG, the people said. The approach would borrow from Hewlett-Packard’s Project Moonshot systems, which let customers cram thousands of computing cartridges into a machine to attack Web serving and data-analysis problems, the people said. As part of the effort, the company formed an internal division, to be run by Saar Gillai, formerly vice president of cloud networking, according to a Sept. 13 memo obtained by Bloomberg. The new unit is focused on weaving together disparate cloud-related products, according to the memo. ‘No Synergy’ While Hewlett-Packard has historically had compelling software that businesses can use to adopt cloud computing, the programs have tended to be scattered through its hardware, software and services groups, said Greenbaum of Enterprise Applications Consulting. “There was no synergy,” he said. The new all-in-one storage and networking devices could start at less than $100,000 and run to as high as several hundred thousand dollars as they’re expanded, one person said. Michael Thacker, a spokesman for Hewlett-Packard, declined to comment on the memo or the Oct. 3 analyst meeting. Also in the works is a package of software that lets companies set up Hewlett-Packard servers, storage and networking gear with a minimum of human intervention as they build cloud- computing operations, people familiar with the project said. The idea is to capture more of businesses’ data-center spending and escape the trap of being considered a supplier of low-cost servers, one person said. Acquisitions Struggle Hewlett-Packard’s growth has been trammeled as the industry’s center of gravity shifted to mobile devices away from the personal computers at the heart of its product lineup. At the same time, the biggest builders of data centers are opting to assemble high-performance systems themselves, rather than buy them from established vendors. Hewlett-Packard’s acquisitions haven’t always panned out either. It wrote down the value of Electronic Data Systems, acquired for $13.2 billion in 2008, and Palm, which cost $1.2 billion in 2010. Autonomy, purchased for $10.3 billion last year by Apotheker, has also been listing. Its former CEO, Mike Lynch, departed after “a significant decline in license revenue,” the company said in May. Sales will fall about 1 percent each of the next two years, after a 5 percent drop this year, according to analysts’ projections compiled by Bloomberg. “They’ve destroyed so much market value,” said Marshall, who recommends buying the shares partly on a bet that earnings have “bottomed out” this year. “They have a lot of problem areas.” Apple, Lenovo Whitman has already tackled some of the cost problem, cutting 29,000 jobs by the end of fiscal 2014 to save as much as $3.5 billion a year. On the tablet front, the company is seeking to emphasize security, durability and the ability to run business applications, rather than combat Apple Inc.’s iPad directly, Whitman said in an interview in August. Competition with Apple aside, Hewlett-Packard still risks losing its lead in the PC market to Lenovo Group. Its share of PCs dropped to 14.9 percent in the second quarter, while Lenovo’s increased to 14.7 percent, according to Gartner Inc. Whitman will need to balance an effort to win back share with the urgency of safeguarding profitability. Lamba said he plans to attend the analyst meeting and that he’s optimistic that Whitman “reassures us we’ve seen the bottom.” “It’s a longer-term story,” he said. “There are no quick fixes in this situation.” To contact the reporter on this story: Aaron Ricadela in San Francisco at  aricadela@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net",['Aaron Ricadela'],"HP’s Whitman Said Planning Cloud-to-Tablet Push for Growth Hewlett-Packard Co.

Philippines to Draw Up Shariah-Compliant Stocks List,['Ian Sayson'],2012-09-21 08:18:41,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/philippines-to-draw-up-shariah-compliant-stocks-list.html,"The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) is drawing up a list of Shariah-compliant equities to attract the nation’s Muslim investors and $1.2 trillion of investible funds in the Middle East. The exchange is holding consultations and workshops with the Al-Amanah Islamic Investment Bank of the Philippines, government agencies and the Asian Development Bank on standards for Shariah-compliant stocks, Leo Quinitio, head of the bourse’s capital-markets development division, said in an interview. “There’s a large pool of investible funds in the Middle East that invest only in Shariah-compliant stocks or companies that meet Muslim doctrines,” Quinitio said in Manila yesterday. “We are working on this and hopefully by the first half we will have a list.” The Philippine Stock Exchange has sought to introduce new products, including real estate investment trusts and exchange traded funds , to boost trading in Asia’s 12th-largest stock market. The nation’s equities have a market value of $209 billion, or about equal to Nestle SA (NESN) ’s capitalization, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, Trading on the Philippine stock exchange has averaged 5.86 billion pesos ($141 million) a day this year, 22 percent more than 2011’s average, the data show. The Dow Jones Islamic Market World Index (DJIM) of companies that meet Islamic guidelines has surged 13 percent this year, outpacing an 8.3 percent gain by the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. No Alcohol Quinitio said Muslims are restricted from investing in companies that violate Shariah doctrines, which forbid the engagement in activities deemed unethical such as gambling, production of alcohol and armaments. There are also restrictions on interest-related income, he said. Apple Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and PetroChina Co. are the three biggest Shariah-compliant companies by market value that Muslims can invest in, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Drawing up a list of Shariah-compliant stocks can be “very difficult,” according to Abdul Jalil Abdul Rasheed, chief executive at Kuala Lumpur-based Aberdeen Islamic Asset Management. “One of the challenges is how detailed do they want the standards to be and this can make the work intensive,” Rasheed said. “Do you want it to be 100 percent compliant or have a tolerance level of say 5 percent of earnings come from non-halal business? The other challenge is do you want the financing of the business to be shariah-compliant as well?” Overseas Buying The Philippine exchange is working with the National Commission for Muslim Filipinos to form a Shariah advisory council, Quinitio said. “There are no signs so far that investors’ interest in the Philippines has waned,” he said. “The market is enjoying a good momentum.” Overseas investors bought a net $2.19 billion of Philippine equities this year to Sept. 20, compared with $1.33 billion of purchases for all of 2011. The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP) has rallied 21 percent this year and closed at a record on July 5 amid optimism about the nation’s economic growth prospects. The $1.3 trillion Shariah-compliant finance industry is expanding globally at an average annual rate of 15 percent, according to a June report from Malaysia’s Securities Commission. The Islamic Financial Services Board in Kuala Lumpur predicts the market will reach $2.8 trillion by 2015. Islamic assets account for about 1 percent of global financial market, according to a March 2012 publication of the UK Islamic Finance Secretariat. The largest centers remain concentrated in Malaysia and the Middle East, including Iran, Saudi Arabia , United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar, according to the report.

The exchange is holding consultations and workshops with the Al-Amanah Islamic Investment Bank of the Philippines, government agencies and the Asian Development Bank on standards for Shariah-compliant stocks, Leo Quinitio, head of the bourse’s capital-markets development division, said in an interview. “There’s a large pool of investible funds in the Middle East that invest only in Shariah-compliant stocks or companies that meet Muslim doctrines,” Quinitio said in Manila yesterday. “We are working on this and hopefully by the first half we will have a list.” The Philippine Stock Exchange has sought to introduce new products, including real estate investment trusts and exchange traded funds , to boost trading in Asia’s 12th-largest stock market. The nation’s equities have a market value of $209 billion, or about equal to Nestle SA (NESN) ’s capitalization, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, Trading on the Philippine stock exchange has averaged 5.86 billion pesos ($141 million) a day this year, 22 percent more than 2011’s average, the data show. The Dow Jones Islamic Market World Index (DJIM) of companies that meet Islamic guidelines has surged 13 percent this year, outpacing an 8.3 percent gain by the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. No Alcohol Quinitio said Muslims are restricted from investing in companies that violate Shariah doctrines, which forbid the engagement in activities deemed unethical such as gambling, production of alcohol and armaments. There are also restrictions on interest-related income, he said.

S&P 500 Snaps Two-Week Rally Amid Global Economy Concern,['Lu Wang'],2012-09-22 04:00:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/s-p-500-snaps-two-week-rally-amid-global-economy-concern.html,"Stocks fell for the week, after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) climbed to the highest level since 2007, as concern about slowing global growth overshadowed optimism about central bank stimulus. Financial and commodity shares dropped the most for the week among 10 industry groups in the S&P 500 as Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Alcoa Inc. (AA) declined more than 4.6 percent. FedEx Corp. (FDX) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) slumped at least 6.4 percent amid disappointing forecasts, driving the Dow Jones Transportation Average to its biggest weekly loss since November. Apple Inc. (AAPL) climbed 1.3 percent amid its iPhone 5 debut that analysts say will be the largest for any consumer electronics in history. The S&P 500 slipped 0.4 percent to 1,460.15, snapping a two-week rally. The benchmark index is up 16 percent for 2012. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 13.90 points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,579.47 during the week. “We’re having a consolidation,” Jason Cooper , who helps oversee $2.5 billion in South Bend, Indiana, at 1st Source Investment Advisors, said in a phone interview. “That can be constructive in that we’re not just throwing money and not thinking about our decisions. We’re starting to get a little bit of an indication about what we could be seeing in terms of earnings for some of these companies. A lot of them are going to be very cautious.” Equities slipped amid increasing signs that the global economic slowdown is worsening. A Chinese manufacturing survey pointed to an 11th month of contraction. Japan’s exports fell while euro-area services and manufacturing output dropped to a 39-month low. In the U.S., more Americans than forecast filed unemployment claims and a gauge of leading indicators slipped. To spur growth, the Bank of Japan unexpectedly increased its asset-purchase target. Central Banks The S&P 500 has jumped 14 percent from a June low amid optimism central banks around the world will take steps to stimulate the economy. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve unveiled another round of quantitative easing and the European Central Bank announced specifics of its bond-buying plan. While the rally brought the S&P 500 to its highest level since December 2007 and within less than 10 percent of its all- time high of 1,565.15, the index is trading at about 14.9 times its companies’ reported earnings. That compares with an average multiple of about 16.3 since 1954. The S&P 500’s change was capped at 0.3 percent every day for the week. The last time the index had a week with daily swings of less than that was during the final week of 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. ‘Little Surprising’ “The move that we’ve had in stocks may seem a little surprising and investors are digesting all the policy actions that have occurred,” Jeff Schwarte, a money manager who helps oversee about $260 billion in Des Moines, Iowa, at Principal Global Investors, said in a phone interview. “People are sitting on their hands waiting for more data to support their positioning.” Companies whose earnings are most tied to economic swings performed the worst for the week, with financial and commodity shares falling at least 1.7 percent as a group. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index tumbled 1.9 percent, the most since June. Bank of America slipped 4.6 percent to $9.11. Alcoa declined 7.2 percent to $9.13 as the biggest U.S. aluminum producer was cut to hold from buy by Peter Ward, an analyst with Jefferies Group Inc. Commodities Tumble Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) plunged 16 percent, the most in the S&P 500 , to $7.21. The second-largest U.S. coal producer will close eight mines, eliminating 1,200 jobs and reducing output in its biggest production cut since a boom in shale-gas output began driving down fuel prices. The S&P GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities tumbled 4.4 percent for the week as crude dropped the most since June. The Dow Transportation (TRAN) slipped 5.9 percent, the biggest weekly retreat since November. FedEx dropped 6.4 percent to $84.39. The operator of the world’s largest cargo airline cut its annual profit outlook because a weakening economy has prompted shippers in the U.S. and overseas to switch to cheaper delivery options. Norfolk tumbled 13 percent, the most since March 2009, to $65. The second-largest eastern U.S. railroad said third-quarter profit will fall short of analysts’ estimates as volumes slid. CSX Corp. (CSX) dropped 8.8 percent to $21.13, while Union Pacific Corp. (UNP) slid 7.1 percent to $119.37. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) sank 14 percent to $61.57. The operator of more than 1,000 home-furnishing stores reported second-quarter profit that trailed analysts’ estimates. Penney Drops J.C. Penney Co. dropped 10 percent to $25.89. Chief Executive Officer Ron Johnson ’s showcase of the stores’ new layout on Sept. 19 failed to inspire confidence in his remake of the 110-year-old retailer. Billionaire investor Michael Price said in a “Bloomberg Surveillance” interview Sept. 21 that he’s bullish on the company because it is “doing all the right things” and will benefit from rising demand among U.S. shoppers. Phone stocks rose the most among the S&P 500’s 10 industry groups, climbing 2.4 percent. Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third- largest U.S. wireless carrier, rallied 7.4 percent to $5.65 after Chief Executive Officer Dan Hesse said the company would probably play a role in future industry consolidation. MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) , a prepaid carrier that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. touted as a takeover target for Sprint, increased 9.4 percent to $11.63. Apple climbed 1.3 percent to $700.10 for an eighth straight weekly gain, the longest stretch in three years. Apple may sell as many as 10 million iPhones during the weekend sales rush, according to Gene Munster , an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. Homebuilders Rally An S&P index of homebuilders rose 2 percent to the highest level since August 2007 as sales of existing American homes rose more than forecast and KB Home (KBH) reported an unexpected profit. KB Home, the Los Angeles-based homebuilder that targets first-time buyers, jumped 12 percent to $15.26. Moody’s Corp. (MCO) increased 4.5 percent to $45.80, completing 18 consecutive days of gains for the longest winning streak since at least 1998. The world’s second-largest provider of credit ratings raised its estimate for full-year earnings on Sept. 12 as demand for its services boosts revenue amid rising global bond sales.

RIM Falls as BlackBerry Service Disrupted in Europe,['Amy Thomson' 'Hugo Miller'],2012-09-21 20:17:17,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/rim-says-blackberry-service-disrupted-in-europe.html,"Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) ’s BlackBerry customers in parts of Europe suffered a service disruption on the same day as Apple Inc. (AAPL) introduced a new iPhone, the second time that’s happened in two years. The malfunction, disclosed earlier today, has since been resolved and didn’t affect North America, RIM’s biggest market, Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM said in e-mails. Some BlackBerry users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa lost e-mail and Internet access, wireless carrier Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) said. RIM is struggling with slumping sales as users switch to devices from Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and Apple, which began selling its iPhone 5 in stores globally today.

As many as 6 percent of RIM’s more than 78 million BlackBerry subscribers may have been affected, though the disruption didn’t last more than three hours, he said.

Apple CEO Cook Apologizes for China IPhone Warranties,['Adam Satariano'],2013-04-02 08:03:45,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/apple-ceo-cook-apologizes-for-china-iphone-warranties.html,"Apple Inc (AAPL). Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook apologized for the company’s iPhone warranty and repair policies in China after receiving criticism from state-run media over customer service in its second-largest market. Apple, in a change in practice, will offer full replacements of older iPhones experiencing problems, Cook said in a letter posted on the company’s Chinese website. Apple also vowed to improve training, customer service and monitoring of stores authorized to sell its products in China. The stock fell 3.1 percent yesterday, its biggest decline since Jan. 24. “In the process of studying the issues, we recognize that some people may have viewed our lack of communication as arrogant, or as a sign that we didn’t care about or value their feedback,” Cook said. “We sincerely apologize to our customers for any concern or confusion we may have caused.” The letter underscores China ’s importance to Apple, whose stock has fallen in the past six months amid concerns about slowing sales and profit growth. The country, which is Apple’s biggest market after the U.S., accounted for $22.8 billion in sales in fiscal 2012, and the company sold more than 2 million iPhone 5 models in the first weekend it went on sale there. “We have tremendous respect for China,” Cook said. “Our customers here will always be central to our thoughts.” Apple (AAPL) fell to $428.91 at the close in New York yesterday. The shares have dropped 19 percent this year, compared with a 9.5 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. ‘Apple’s Arrogance’ The apology follows criticism from Chinese media outlets of Apple’s customer service and warranty policies. State broadcaster China Central Television criticized the company’s practices on Consumer Rights Day. The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, followed with articles, including a March 27 commentary that said “Destroy Apple’s ‘Incomparable’ Arrogance.’” The central government also said it planned to increase scrutiny of contracts with electronics makers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. “I want to say that it is completely normal for the Apple company to apologize to Chinese consumers, and I think such act is commendable,” Hong Lei, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, said during a briefing in Beijing today. ‘Deep Commitment’ The negative reports focused on complaints that Apple repaired broken iPhones instead of replacing them and that warranties weren’t sufficiently long. While Apple said 90 percent of customers had been satisfied by fixes it had been making, the company also said it would replace those handsets with new ones and offer extended warranties. “We recognize that we have much to learn about operating and communicating in China, but we want to assure everyone that we bring the same deep commitment and passion to China as we do to any other part of the world,” Cook said. The same CCTV report also targeted Volkswagen AG, saying customers reported abnormal vibrations, loss of power and sudden acceleration in models fitted with a direct-shift gearbox. Europe ’s largest automaker subsequently announced a recall. Last year, France ’s Carrefour SA shut an outlet in central China after CCTV reported it had falsely labeled meat sold at the store. The world’s second-largest retailer sold regular chicken as premium for higher prices, according to the report. “State media has been picking on foreign companies really too much lately,” said Shaun Rein , managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. “This isn’t good for foreign investment.” HP’s Lesson While Apple’s sales have been growing in China, it still lags behind smartphone competitors in the country, where the average consumer earns less than $600 a month. The company is in sixth place, according to market researcher IDC, trailing competitors including Samsung Electronics Co. and Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , which offer devices in a range of styles and prices. The iPhone also isn’t being sold by the country’s largest wireless carrier, China Mobile Ltd. (941)  “At a minimum, these attacks put a wrench into Apple’s ability to strike a deal with China Mobile to open opportunities further in China,” Glen Yeung, an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets Inc., wrote in a research report. He has a neutral rating on the shares with a $480 target price. Apple is trying to avoid the fate of Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , which saw its share of the personal computer market drop by 50 percent in China after it was the subject of media criticism, according to Yeung. If Apple’s market share fell by that much, it could result in $13.1 billion in lost sales, Yeung said. Jobs Apology Cook’s letter marks his second public effort to make amends with customers. He also apologized for the company’s mapping software in September after it was faulted for misguided directions and inaccurate landmark locations. Apple has apologized for policies related to the iPhone before. Following the first iPhone release in 2007, co-founder Steve Jobs offered users rebates and an apology because early customers complained about a price cut two months after it went on sale. In 2010, Jobs apologized and gave out free cases to customers because of antenna defects for the iPhone 4. After Consumer Reports and other publications showed the device would lose its signal if held a certain way, Jobs called a rare press conference to explain the issue.

(941)  “At a minimum, these attacks put a wrench into Apple’s ability to strike a deal with China Mobile to open opportunities further in China,” Glen Yeung, an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets Inc., wrote in a research report. He has a neutral rating on the shares with a $480 target price. Apple is trying to avoid the fate of Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , which saw its share of the personal computer market drop by 50 percent in China after it was the subject of media criticism, according to Yeung. If Apple’s market share fell by that much, it could result in $13.1 billion in lost sales, Yeung said. Jobs Apology Cook’s letter marks his second public effort to make amends with customers. He also apologized for the company’s mapping software in September after it was faulted for misguided directions and inaccurate landmark locations. Apple has apologized for policies related to the iPhone before. Following the first iPhone release in 2007, co-founder Steve Jobs offered users rebates and an apology because early customers complained about a price cut two months after it went on sale. In 2010, Jobs apologized and gave out free cases to customers because of antenna defects for the iPhone 4. After Consumer Reports and other publications showed the device would lose its signal if held a certain way, Jobs called a rare press conference to explain the issue.

Amazon Reign as Most Expensive Stock Seen Ending on Profit: Tech,['Danielle Kucera'],2013-04-01 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/amazon-reign-as-most-expensive-stock-seen-ending-on-profit-tech.html,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s days as the most expensive stock in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index are numbered as Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos reaps profit from an $18.5 billion spending spree designed to spur growth. Amazon, whose stock has almost doubled in three years, trades at more than 700 times earnings, the highest ratio of any company in the S&P 500 -- a ranking it has held for nine months. As investments in digital content and cloud computing begin to pay off, that multiple is predicted to fall to 48 next year, making Amazon the 10th-most costly in the benchmark index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors are betting on higher earnings as Amazon sells more movies, music and books for the Kindle Fire tablet and gets additional outside businesses to sell items from its storefront. Operating margin is projected to widen in 2013 after contracting for two straight years as the company funneled money into warehouses and improved its ability to deliver computing services over the Internet. “Investors have shown a willingness to accept a rich valuation for a company that’s executing at a very high level and investing,” said Tom Forte , an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group. “There’s a belief that at some point, you’ll have a margin recovery.” Seattle-based Amazon, founded by Bezos in 1994, has evolved from an online bookseller into a peddler of everything from designer clothing to toy drones, tablet computers and digital downloads of books, movies and music. Investors’ Patience After going public in 1997 and surviving the deflation of the dot-com bubble, Amazon has long enjoyed the patience of investors, who have accepted the company’s push for future growth at the expense of more immediate profit. That has led to a rising share price even as earnings have tumbled, resulting in a lofty price-to-earnings ratio. EBay Inc. (EBAY) , operator of the largest online marketplace, trades at 28 times earnings, while Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the world’s most valuable company, trades at a multiple of 10. Amazon shares have soared 98 percent since the end of 2009, even as the company swung to a loss of $39 million last year from $1.15 billion in profit in 2010. Revenue surged 27 percent to $61.1 billion in 2012 and may gain another 24 percent in 2013, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. All this has made Bezos the world’s 19th-richest person, with a fortune of $24.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Margin Confidence Shareholders have given Amazon the benefit of the doubt, speculating that margin pressure is a result of strategic investments that will make Amazon more competitive down the road, said Mark Mahaney , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “The market essentially normalized the company’s earnings and said, ‘I know margins are down from 6 percent, but there’s nothing structurally that’s caused the margins to go down,’” said Mahaney, who’s based in San Francisco. “The market has said, ‘I’m going to buy the stock before the margins come back up because I’m confident they will.’” One of the biggest areas of investment is warehouses. Amazon is using these facilities to transform itself into a marketplace where other merchants can use its platform to sell their own products. Spending on warehouses increased 58 percent in 2011, accelerating for a second straight year. Amazon takes a commission -- which is almost entirely profit -- for each item sold and collects additional fees when the smaller retailers use its network of fulfillment centers to ship goods, Mahaney said. The model is partially an emulation of EBay, which had 21 percent operating margins in 2012, and doesn’t own any inventory sold on its site. There’s a risk that Amazon’s profit will fail to rebound as quickly as predicted. That may result in a decline in the stock price, something that could also reduce the company’s price-to- earnings ratio. JPMorgan Downgrade Not all analysts agree that third-party sales will boost margins so soon. Doug Anmuth, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., downgraded Amazon to a neutral rating March 14, predicting Amazon’s gross profit growth will decelerate this year as sales by outside merchants slow. A declining growth rate matters because that business segment, as well as the extra fees Amazon collects when the company handles shipping, accounted for 45 percent of gross profit last year, Anmuth said. On Jan. 25, the online retailer traded at a record 788.86 times earnings, four days before reporting fourth-quarter revenue that missed analysts’ estimates. Amazon traded at 740 times trailing 12-month earnings at the close on March 28, and has held the highest multiple in the S&P 500 Index since June 30, when it overtook Equity Residential. Cloud Platform Bezos took a similar path eight years ago, when he ramped up investments in the company’s cloud-computing platform, which now dominates the market with an estimated 35 percent share, according to Barclays Plc. Technology and content expenses, which include cloud services, soared 59 percent to $451 million in 2005, compared with a 10 percent increase the year before. In 2006, that number rose by 47 percent, more than any other expense line item -- narrowing Amazon’s operating margin by more than 2 percentage points in two years to 3.63 percent. The shares fell 11 percent from the end of 2004 to the end of 2006. In the four years that followed, the rate of spending on technology and content fell, and operating margin widened, remaining between 4 percent and 5 percent -- something investors cite as proof that Amazon can be profitable when it’s not investing in new ventures. The company’s stock recovered, more than quadrupling to $180 on Dec. 31, 2010. “There’s a precedent for this, where Amazon went through a phase of hyper investment and then scaled back -- and the stock performed incredibly well,” Forte said. Customer Proximity This time, the company is seeking to create more efficiency by spending money to build warehouses closer to customers, which is also helping recruit smaller retailers to use its services. Amazon’s fulfillment costs are its largest, totaling about $14 billion over the past three years. The retailer added 20 warehouses last year. There are signs that profitability is already rebounding. In the fourth quarter, Amazon’s operating margin in North America , where it generates 57 percent of revenue, expanded to 5 percent from 2.9 percent a year earlier, buoying the stock. Margin growth across the company may follow as early as the second quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Analysts on average estimate that operating margin will increase to 1.8 percent, compared with 0.83 percent in the same period last year and a projected 1.4 percent in the first quarter. The number could go as high as 2.8 percent, according to Mahaney. Shipping Costs Operating margin for the year is estimated to widen to 2.1 percent from 1.1 percent in 2012. While Amazon sacrifices profit up front to build its infrastructure, investors are predicting that the proximity to customers will temper shipping costs in the future. It’s cheaper to send a product to New York , for example, from a warehouse in New Jersey than from a center in Arizona. “To the extent that they can bring fulfillment centers closer to consumers, that can give them a lot more money to invest in other initiatives,” Forte said. Still, that extra spending money won’t come soon. Amazon has to grapple with annual increases in shipping costs, even with its discounted rates for volume, Forte said. “The investment recovery is going to take some time,” Forte said. “The challenge that Amazon has to overcome, if you look at FedEx and UPS, they basically raise rates at a 4 to 5 percent rate per year.” Entertainment Deals Amazon has also made deals with Sony Corp. (6758) , Time Warner Inc.’s Turner Broadcasting and Warner Bros. units, Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and other providers of movies and TV shows, ramping up competition with Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  Though Amazon pays for the licensing agreements, the online retailer logs subsequent sales of the content as pure profit, similar to how it deals with books and music. Amazon is banking on that high-margin revenue to make its Kindle Fire tablet, which Bezos has said he sells at cost, a success. Last week the company also announced the acquisition of book-recommendation site Goodreads, part of a push to get people to buy more titles on the Kindle e-reader. Those efforts are projected to continue bolstering the company’s profit beyond this year, with analysts on average predicting an operating margin of 3.1 percent for 2014. “What the market is assuming, and what I’m assuming, is starting in this March quarter, you’re going to see improved conversion of free cash flow ,” Mahaney said. “I’m assuming the worst of the margin pressure is now behind the company.” To contact the reporter on this story: Danielle Kucera in San Francisco at dkucera6@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net",['Danielle Kucera'],"Amazon Reign as Most Expensive Stock Seen Ending on Profit: Tech Amazon.com Inc.

"Apple, Wharton, Del Monte, DuPont: Intellectual Property",['Victoria Slind-Flor'],2013-04-01 11:01:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/apple-wharton-del-monte-dupont-intellectual-property.html,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s future iPhones may look very different from present models, if a recently published patent application is any indication. The Cupertino, California-based company submitted an application, published in the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on March 28, for what it calls “an electronic device with wrap-around display.” According to application 20130076612 , the mobile device will have a flexible display housing that is enclosed in a transparent housing. Apple said any portion of the display can show visual content. The present configuration of most mobile devices leaves its sides and rear surfaces “unused or at best configured with buttons and switches with fixed location and functionality,” according to the application. Because many of the device’s buttons and switches have fixed functionality they can’t always be incorporated into third-party applications, Apple said. The aim of the new configuration would be to provide functionality on more than one surface, Apple said. The company applied for the patent in September 2011. Unlike many Apple patent applications or patents related to the appearance of the company’s products, the application doesn’t name the late Steve Jobs , the company founder, as an inventor.

Trademark Penn Accuses California Company of Being Wharton Imposter The University of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit accusing a California company of violating a trademark associated with the Wharton Business School. The Wharton Business Foundation, which has locations in Beverly Hills, California, and Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, is using Penn’s 132-year-old Wharton trademark without authorization, lawyers for the university said in a complaint made public March 28 in federal court in Philadelphia. The company’s use of the name “creates a likelihood of confusion in the marketplace,” the University of Pennsylvania said in its complaint. Wharton Business Foundation operates a website with the Wharton name and offers services including business education and business consultation through its Wharton Business Foundation University, according to the complaint. The company also advertises and has a toll-free phone number 888-4-WHARTON, the university said in its filing. Penn has been using the Wharton registered mark for business education since as early as 1881 and for business consultation since 1953, lawyers for the university said in the filing. According to the school’s website , the name comes from businessman and entrepreneur Joseph Wharton, who established “the world’s first collegiate school of business” at the university in 1881. The university is seeking a jury trial and a court order barring the misuse of its mark. Officials at the Wharton Business Foundation didn’t immediately return a phone message seeking comment on the complaint. The case is The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania v. Wharton Business Foundation, 13-cv-01616, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). Del Monte Barred From Some Labeling, Product-Dating Practices Del Monte Foods Co., the maker of canned fruit and pet products controlled by KKR & Co., is barred from using its trademark on refrigerated food products containing five specified kinds of fruit. A federal court in Manhattan told the San Francisco-based food company that it violated a licensing agreement with its 1989 spinoff Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. (FDP) , and falsely informed customers that some of its products that contained preservatives had to be refrigerated The order came in resolution of the contract-dispute suit Fresh filed against Del Monte in 2008. Fresh, based in Coral Gables, Florida, claimed that the California company breached a trademark licensing agreement. According to court papers, the agreement limited Del Monte Foods’ exclusive use of the Del Monte mark to preserved produce and gave Fresh the rights to use it with fresh fruit and vegetables. The dispute centered on the parties’ different interpretations of a license agreement with respect to refrigerated pineapple, melons, berries, papayas and bananas regardless of whether they are fresh or preserved. Following a jury verdict that Del Monte had violated trademark law with respect to some of the products, it gave Fresh a damages award of $7.2 million. Fresh then sought a court order controlling aspects of Del Monte’s packaging and marketing. In his March 28 order, U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein said Del Monte is barred from using the trademark on any product containing any of the five fruits that is intended to be refrigerated or chilled at the point of sale. If Del Monte’s customers are refrigerating these products, the California company is required to tell them in writing that they aren’t permitted to sell them under refrigeration. The company is also barred from pasteurizing or adding chemical preservatives to its fruit products without saying so. The judge said that while Del Monte didn’t have to add “‘Contains Preservatives’’ on the front label, it must state on the ingredient list that certain chemicals added are preservatives. Additionally, Del Monte cannot put ‘‘best by’’ or ‘‘sell by’’ dates on its products without test results that justify the existence of such a date, he said. The case is Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. v. Del Monte Foods Co., 08-cv-08718, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). ‘Star Wars’ Movie May Guide Big East on Selecting New Name Darth Vader might serve as inspiration for the Big East Conference, which must change its name after the so-called Catholic Seven leaves in three months and takes the league’s moniker with them. Among the names suggested by the marketing firm Duffy & Shanley when the conference formed in 1979 was Galactic East, which the company said was inspired by the 1977 movie ‘‘Star Wars.’’ Other suggestions were the Empire Conference, Conference One, Eastern One, Olympic Conference and Eastern Compact, according to the plan, a copy of which was provided to Bloomberg News by Dave Duffy, a partner in the firm at the time. Geographic-based suggestions were the Big East, Met-East and North Atlantic Alliance. Heritage-based suggestions were the Patriot Athletic Conference, Colonial League and Mayflower Compact. The firm’s principal recommendation was the Big East, which will be used by the seven departing schools that include Georgetown University , Villanova University and Providence College. Joseph Shanley, the father of current Providence College President Brian Shanley, was a partner in the marketing firm. ‘‘All the great brands of the world -- General Electric, Coca-Cola, they have a lot of roots,’’ Duffy, 73, said in a telephone interview from Florida. ‘‘It would be hard for the new basketball league to start over and match that.’’ Covington & Burling LLP attorney Marie Lavalleye, acting as a representative of the league, on March 6 filed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the term ‘‘America 12 Conference.’’ She didn’t return a telephone calling seeking comment on the name change. Duffy & Shanley, in the original marketing plan, said the conference’s name, at least in the beginning, shouldn’t include a number because conference members are sure to change, a recommendation he said is even more valid today with the realignment in college sports. Shanley, the Providence president, earlier this month said ‘‘the landscape in college sports has not stopped morphing.” Since 2011, the Big East has lost 16 schools that were either members or dropped out before playing a game. The Pac-10 Conference, meantime, became the Pac-12 after adding two schools. The Big Ten Conference hasn’t had 10 teams since Penn State University joined in 1990. While the Big Ten didn’t change its name at the time, it did alter its logo to reflect an 11th team. The current Big Ten has 12 football members and is adding more. DuPont Drops Trademark-Infringement Suit Against Easton-Bell DuPont Co. (DD) , the maker of Corian countertops and Tyvek packaging materials, dropped a trademark-infringement lawsuit against a California maker of sports equipment. The suit, filed Jan. 28 in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, accused Easton-Bell Sports Inc. of Scotts Valley, California, of infringing the chemical company’s “Kevlar” trademark. DuPont, based in Wilmington, said the size of the Kevlar trademark on Easton-Bell’s packaging was even larger than the California company’s own mark, according to the complaint Easton-Bell has sold and marketed bicycle tires and locks in packaging displaying the Kevlar trademark since July, according to court papers. Such products are sold through retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. (TGT) and Amazon.com Inc., DuPont said. Easton-Bell sued in federal court in San Francisco on Jan. 18, seeking a court declaration that it didn’t infringe the DuPont trademark. In its pleadings, Easton-Bell said it has bought Kevlar from authorized distributors and resellers for at least six years and used it in bike tires and locks. Indicating on its packaging that the products contain Kevlar “has no likelihood of causing confusion,” the company claimed. On March 26, a magistrate judge refused to dismiss Easton- Bell’s case and rejected DuPont’s request that the dispute be transferred to Delaware. He said that DuPont’s request for a transfer was inappropriate. Dupont didn’t give any reason for dropping its suit against Easton-Bell. According to the March 28 filing, Easton-Bell hadn’t answered the complaint or asked that the case be dismissed. The DuPont case is E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. Easton- Bell Sports Inc., 1:13-cv-00150, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). The earlier case is Easton-Bell Sports v. E.I.

Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage Obama Urged by Democrats to Act on China’s Alleged Cyber Thefts President Barack Obama ’s administration should take action to curb China’s alleged cyber theft, two House Democrats said, after a top U.S. official accused the Asian nation of industrial espionage against American companies. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office needs to designate China as a top violator of intellectual property rights, which can lead to further trade restrictions, Representatives Sander Levin of Michigan and Charles Rangel of New York said March 28 in a letter to Acting USTR Demetrios Marantis. “In the case of China, the government itself appears to be actively stealing the intellectual property of American businesses,” the lawmakers, ranking Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, which deals with trade issues, wrote. China’s cyber espionage against U.S. businesses is adding tension between the governments of the world’s two largest economies, Obama’s National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon said in a March 11 speech in New York. In their letter, Levin and Rangel cited a February report by Mandiant Corp., an Arlington, Virginia-based information security firm, that concluded the Chinese government is probably the source of recent hacking attacks. The lawmakers asked the USTR to list China in the annual assessment of intellectual property rights protection and enforcement in other nations, to be released about April 30. “We have received the letter and are reviewing it,” Carol Guthrie , a USTR spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The USTR will seek to toughen trade-secret protection through the annual assessment, the Obama administration said its strategy to mitigate violations, released in February. Intellectual-property protection is among the issues being negotiated as the U.S. seeks trade deals with 10 Pacific-region governments and the 27-nation European Union. Companies including New York-based Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) rely on enforcement of trade laws to protect their patents. Intellectual-property provisions shouldn’t be in a proposed U.S.-EU trade deal because they could raise health-care costs, limit free speech and restrict access to education materials, Washington-based consumer group Public Citizen said in a March 18 statement joined by other organizations. IP Moves Wilson Sonsini Expands IP Practice With Team of Five From Sidley Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati PC expanded its IP practice with the hiring of five patent litigators, the Palo Alto, California-based firm said in a statement. The five new hires all previously were with Chicago’s Sidley Austin LLP. They are Edward Poplawski, Vera Elson, Paul Tripodi II, Olivia M. Kim and Sandra S. Fujiyama. Poplawski , who headed Sidley’s West Coast IP practice, has litigated life-sciences and technology patent cases in federal courts and before the International Trade Commission, a Washington-based entity with the power to exclude imports of products that infringe U.S. intellectual property. He has an undergraduate degree and a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Drexel University and a law degree from Villanova University. Elson has previously practiced at Wilson Sonsini and at Chicago’s McDermott Will & Emery LLP. Before she was a lawyer, she was an electrical engineer at Hughes Aircraft’s Advanced Circuit Technology Labs. She has an undergraduate degree in cybernetics and a master’s degree in engineering from the University of California at Los Angeles and a law degree from the University of Southern California. Tripodi has practiced in both federal court and before the International Trade Commission. He has an undergraduate degree in chemistry from Pennsylvania State University, a master’s degree in chemical physics from the California Institute of Technology and a law degree from the University of California at Los Angeles. Kim has represented clients whose technologies have included biometric sensors, computer processor architecture, Internet payment systems and plasma display panels. She was a researcher at the University of California’s immunology and physiology labs before she became a lawyer. She has an undergraduate degree in biochemistry and a law degree from the University of California at Los Angeles. Fujiyama does patent and trademark acquisition work in addition to litigation.

The Cupertino, California-based company submitted an application, published in the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on March 28, for what it calls “an electronic device with wrap-around display.” According to application 20130076612 , the mobile device will have a flexible display housing that is enclosed in a transparent housing. Apple said any portion of the display can show visual content. The present configuration of most mobile devices leaves its sides and rear surfaces “unused or at best configured with buttons and switches with fixed location and functionality,” according to the application. Because many of the device’s buttons and switches have fixed functionality they can’t always be incorporated into third-party applications, Apple said. The aim of the new configuration would be to provide functionality on more than one surface, Apple said. The company applied for the patent in September 2011. Unlike many Apple patent applications or patents related to the appearance of the company’s products, the application doesn’t name the late Steve Jobs , the company founder, as an inventor.

Trademark Penn Accuses California Company of Being Wharton Imposter The University of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit accusing a California company of violating a trademark associated with the Wharton Business School. The Wharton Business Foundation, which has locations in Beverly Hills, California, and Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, is using Penn’s 132-year-old Wharton trademark without authorization, lawyers for the university said in a complaint made public March 28 in federal court in Philadelphia. The company’s use of the name “creates a likelihood of confusion in the marketplace,” the University of Pennsylvania said in its complaint. Wharton Business Foundation operates a website with the Wharton name and offers services including business education and business consultation through its Wharton Business Foundation University, according to the complaint. The company also advertises and has a toll-free phone number 888-4-WHARTON, the university said in its filing. Penn has been using the Wharton registered mark for business education since as early as 1881 and for business consultation since 1953, lawyers for the university said in the filing. According to the school’s website , the name comes from businessman and entrepreneur Joseph Wharton, who established “the world’s first collegiate school of business” at the university in 1881. The university is seeking a jury trial and a court order barring the misuse of its mark. Officials at the Wharton Business Foundation didn’t immediately return a phone message seeking comment on the complaint. The case is The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania v. Wharton Business Foundation, 13-cv-01616, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). Del Monte Barred From Some Labeling, Product-Dating Practices Del Monte Foods Co., the maker of canned fruit and pet products controlled by KKR & Co., is barred from using its trademark on refrigerated food products containing five specified kinds of fruit. A federal court in Manhattan told the San Francisco-based food company that it violated a licensing agreement with its 1989 spinoff Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. (FDP) , and falsely informed customers that some of its products that contained preservatives had to be refrigerated The order came in resolution of the contract-dispute suit Fresh filed against Del Monte in 2008. Fresh, based in Coral Gables, Florida, claimed that the California company breached a trademark licensing agreement. According to court papers, the agreement limited Del Monte Foods’ exclusive use of the Del Monte mark to preserved produce and gave Fresh the rights to use it with fresh fruit and vegetables. The dispute centered on the parties’ different interpretations of a license agreement with respect to refrigerated pineapple, melons, berries, papayas and bananas regardless of whether they are fresh or preserved. Following a jury verdict that Del Monte had violated trademark law with respect to some of the products, it gave Fresh a damages award of $7.2 million. Fresh then sought a court order controlling aspects of Del Monte’s packaging and marketing. In his March 28 order, U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein said Del Monte is barred from using the trademark on any product containing any of the five fruits that is intended to be refrigerated or chilled at the point of sale. If Del Monte’s customers are refrigerating these products, the California company is required to tell them in writing that they aren’t permitted to sell them under refrigeration. The company is also barred from pasteurizing or adding chemical preservatives to its fruit products without saying so. The judge said that while Del Monte didn’t have to add “‘Contains Preservatives’’ on the front label, it must state on the ingredient list that certain chemicals added are preservatives. Additionally, Del Monte cannot put ‘‘best by’’ or ‘‘sell by’’ dates on its products without test results that justify the existence of such a date, he said. The case is Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. v. Del Monte Foods Co., 08-cv-08718, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). ‘Star Wars’ Movie May Guide Big East on Selecting New Name Darth Vader might serve as inspiration for the Big East Conference, which must change its name after the so-called Catholic Seven leaves in three months and takes the league’s moniker with them. Among the names suggested by the marketing firm Duffy & Shanley when the conference formed in 1979 was Galactic East, which the company said was inspired by the 1977 movie ‘‘Star Wars.’’ Other suggestions were the Empire Conference, Conference One, Eastern One, Olympic Conference and Eastern Compact, according to the plan, a copy of which was provided to Bloomberg News by Dave Duffy, a partner in the firm at the time. Geographic-based suggestions were the Big East, Met-East and North Atlantic Alliance. Heritage-based suggestions were the Patriot Athletic Conference, Colonial League and Mayflower Compact. The firm’s principal recommendation was the Big East, which will be used by the seven departing schools that include Georgetown University , Villanova University and Providence College. Joseph Shanley, the father of current Providence College President Brian Shanley, was a partner in the marketing firm. ‘‘All the great brands of the world -- General Electric, Coca-Cola, they have a lot of roots,’’ Duffy, 73, said in a telephone interview from Florida. ‘‘It would be hard for the new basketball league to start over and match that.’’ Covington & Burling LLP attorney Marie Lavalleye, acting as a representative of the league, on March 6 filed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the term ‘‘America 12 Conference.’’ She didn’t return a telephone calling seeking comment on the name change. Duffy & Shanley, in the original marketing plan, said the conference’s name, at least in the beginning, shouldn’t include a number because conference members are sure to change, a recommendation he said is even more valid today with the realignment in college sports. Shanley, the Providence president, earlier this month said ‘‘the landscape in college sports has not stopped morphing.” Since 2011, the Big East has lost 16 schools that were either members or dropped out before playing a game. The Pac-10 Conference, meantime, became the Pac-12 after adding two schools. The Big Ten Conference hasn’t had 10 teams since Penn State University joined in 1990. While the Big Ten didn’t change its name at the time, it did alter its logo to reflect an 11th team. The current Big Ten has 12 football members and is adding more. DuPont Drops Trademark-Infringement Suit Against Easton-Bell DuPont Co. (DD) , the maker of Corian countertops and Tyvek packaging materials, dropped a trademark-infringement lawsuit against a California maker of sports equipment. The suit, filed Jan. 28 in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, accused Easton-Bell Sports Inc. of Scotts Valley, California, of infringing the chemical company’s “Kevlar” trademark. DuPont, based in Wilmington, said the size of the Kevlar trademark on Easton-Bell’s packaging was even larger than the California company’s own mark, according to the complaint Easton-Bell has sold and marketed bicycle tires and locks in packaging displaying the Kevlar trademark since July, according to court papers. Such products are sold through retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. (TGT) and Amazon.com Inc., DuPont said. Easton-Bell sued in federal court in San Francisco on Jan. 18, seeking a court declaration that it didn’t infringe the DuPont trademark. In its pleadings, Easton-Bell said it has bought Kevlar from authorized distributors and resellers for at least six years and used it in bike tires and locks. Indicating on its packaging that the products contain Kevlar “has no likelihood of causing confusion,” the company claimed. On March 26, a magistrate judge refused to dismiss Easton- Bell’s case and rejected DuPont’s request that the dispute be transferred to Delaware. He said that DuPont’s request for a transfer was inappropriate. Dupont didn’t give any reason for dropping its suit against Easton-Bell. According to the March 28 filing, Easton-Bell hadn’t answered the complaint or asked that the case be dismissed. The DuPont case is E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. Easton- Bell Sports Inc., 1:13-cv-00150, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). The earlier case is Easton-Bell Sports v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co, 3:13-cv-00283, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). For more trademark news, click here. For copyright news, click here. Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage Obama Urged by Democrats to Act on China’s Alleged Cyber Thefts President Barack Obama ’s administration should take action to curb China’s alleged cyber theft, two House Democrats said, after a top U.S. official accused the Asian nation of industrial espionage against American companies. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office needs to designate China as a top violator of intellectual property rights, which can lead to further trade restrictions, Representatives Sander Levin of Michigan and Charles Rangel of New York said March 28 in a letter to Acting USTR Demetrios Marantis. “In the case of China, the government itself appears to be actively stealing the intellectual property of American businesses,” the lawmakers, ranking Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, which deals with trade issues, wrote. China’s cyber espionage against U.S. businesses is adding tension between the governments of the world’s two largest economies, Obama’s National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon said in a March 11 speech in New York. In their letter, Levin and Rangel cited a February report by Mandiant Corp., an Arlington, Virginia-based information security firm, that concluded the Chinese government is probably the source of recent hacking attacks. The lawmakers asked the USTR to list China in the annual assessment of intellectual property rights protection and enforcement in other nations, to be released about April 30. “We have received the letter and are reviewing it,” Carol Guthrie , a USTR spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The USTR will seek to toughen trade-secret protection through the annual assessment, the Obama administration said its strategy to mitigate violations, released in February. Intellectual-property protection is among the issues being negotiated as the U.S. seeks trade deals with 10 Pacific-region governments and the 27-nation European Union. Companies including New York-based Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) rely on enforcement of trade laws to protect their patents. Intellectual-property provisions shouldn’t be in a proposed U.S.-EU trade deal because they could raise health-care costs, limit free speech and restrict access to education materials, Washington-based consumer group Public Citizen said in a March 18 statement joined by other organizations. IP Moves Wilson Sonsini Expands IP Practice With Team of Five From Sidley Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati PC expanded its IP practice with the hiring of five patent litigators, the Palo Alto, California-based firm said in a statement. The five new hires all previously were with Chicago’s Sidley Austin LLP. They are Edward Poplawski, Vera Elson, Paul Tripodi II, Olivia M. Kim and Sandra S. Fujiyama. Poplawski , who headed Sidley’s West Coast IP practice, has litigated life-sciences and technology patent cases in federal courts and before the International Trade Commission, a Washington-based entity with the power to exclude imports of products that infringe U.S. intellectual property. He has an undergraduate degree and a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Drexel University and a law degree from Villanova University. Elson has previously practiced at Wilson Sonsini and at Chicago’s McDermott Will & Emery LLP. Before she was a lawyer, she was an electrical engineer at Hughes Aircraft’s Advanced Circuit Technology Labs. She has an undergraduate degree in cybernetics and a master’s degree in engineering from the University of California at Los Angeles and a law degree from the University of Southern California. Tripodi has practiced in both federal court and before the International Trade Commission. He has an undergraduate degree in chemistry from Pennsylvania State University, a master’s degree in chemical physics from the California Institute of Technology and a law degree from the University of California at Los Angeles. Kim has represented clients whose technologies have included biometric sensors, computer processor architecture, Internet payment systems and plasma display panels. She was a researcher at the University of California’s immunology and physiology labs before she became a lawyer. She has an undergraduate degree in biochemistry and a law degree from the University of California at Los Angeles. Fujiyama does patent and trademark acquisition work in addition to litigation.

Vivendi Wins Copyright Ruling in Used-Digital-Song Case,['Don Jeffrey'],2013-04-01 22:17:43,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/vivendi-wins-copyright-ruling-in-used-digital-song-case.html,"ReDigi Inc., an online service that lets people buy and sell second-hand digital songs, violates the copyrights of Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s Capitol Records, a federal judge ruled. U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan ruled in Capitol’s favor without a trial, saying the litigation will continue to determine whether the site should be shut down and monetary damages assessed. In a separate ruling, also dated March 30, Sullivan denied ReDigi’s request to dismiss the case. Record companies have sued many online music services to prevent erosion of sales of CDs and digital songs. Capitol sued ReDigi last year, claiming that it infringes copyrights by allowing unauthorized copying of digital music files. ReDigi argued that it’s protected by the Copyright Act’s first-sale doctrine, which lets legitimate buyers of music resell it. “The novel question presented in this action is whether a digital music file, lawfully made and purchased, may be resold by its owner through ReDigi under the first-sale doctrine,” Sullivan said in his ruling. “The court determines that it cannot.” ReDigi, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts , argued it makes no unauthorized copies of songs. The company said it provides digital music storage and a marketplace for tracks legitimately bought from Apple Inc.’s iTunes. Sale Process “The technology behind our sale process does not involve the making of even a single copy,” John Ossenmacher, the chief executive officer and a founder of ReDigi, said in court papers. ReDigi said in a statement that the court’s ruling applies only to its original technology and not to its updated offering, which it calls ReDigi 2.0. “ReDigi will continue to keep its ReDigi 2.0 service running and will appeal the ReDigi 1.0 decision,” the company said in its e-mailed statement. Maria Ho-Burge, a spokeswoman for Capitol’s record company, Universal Music Group , said the company had no comment on the ruling. ReDigi allows users to upload tracks to its site where buyers can download them for 59 cents to 79 cents each. ITunes charges 99 cents for most tracks and the music companies take about 70 cents from each transaction. The labels receive no revenue from a ReDigi resale. ReDigi takes 60 percent of the proceeds of each sale, according to today’s ruling. While ReDigi said in court papers that it was protected from liability by the first-sale doctrine, the label argued that the online service isn’t selling an original track purchased from iTunes but rather a digital copy of it. Capitol is seeking statutory damages of as much as $150,000 from ReDigi for each track infringed. Capitol recordings sold by by the online service include Coldplay’s “Clocks,” Lady Antebellum’s “Need You Now” and Nat King Cole’s “The Christmas Song,” according to the complaint. The case is Capitol Records v. ReDigi, 12-00095, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Smartphone buyers are increasingly snapping up devices with screens measuring 5 inches (13 centimeters) or more for easier Web browsing and video viewing, while others pick up a tablet to accompany their handset. Nokia is absent from both categories, dominated by Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and Apple Inc. (AAPL)  Nokia’s failure to enter the large-screen market early on marks the third time in a decade the company has overlooked a major trend: In 2004 it was slow to embrace clamshell handsets, then a few years later it missed out on touch screens. This time, the company’s future in smartphones is at stake as it seeks to sustain the nascent revival it has enjoyed with Lumia. “This is a trend that can’t be missed,” said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst at researcher IDC in London. “People are using smartphones in different ways now, consuming media by streaming over faster mobile networks. A 5-inch screen for a smartphone just feels right in the hand.” Sales of handsets 5 inches or bigger soared to 29.7 million units last year from 1.2 million a year earlier, Jeronimo said. Stock Drop While Nokia hasn’t announced any bigger devices, the company is almost certainly preparing one and could release it within a few months, Jeronimo said. James Etheridge, a Nokia spokesman, declined to comment on plans for bigger-screen smartphones and tablets, saying that the company is still assessing consumer interest in them. Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland, fell 0.5 percent to close at 2.51 euros in Helsinki trading. The stock has lost about 90 percent since the iPhone and Google’s Android were introduced in 2007. Over the same period, Apple has almost tripled and Samsung has more than doubled. Nearly 20 percent of Nokia’s shares are on loan -- borrowed stock is typically shorted --more than eight times the average among Euro Stoxx 50 members, according to Markit, a financial-information provider in London. Nokia’s flagship Lumia features a 4.5-inch screen, and the rest of its handsets have smaller displays. While the company has focused on the design and software of its smartphones, competitors have been getting bigger. Galaxy S3 The 4.8-inch Galaxy S3 from Samsung, the world’s largest handset maker, became the top-selling smartphone globally last year. The Galaxy S4, an updated version introduced last month, has a 5-inch screen. Samsung’s Note 2 has a 5.5-inch display. ZTE Corp. (000063) ’s Grand Memo has a 5.7-inch display, and the Ascend Mate from China ’s Huawei Technologies Co. boasts a 6.1-inch screen. Samsung in February unveiled the Note 8.0 , an 8-inch device that works as a mobile phone. The industry often calls such devices “phablets” because they blur the line between phones and tablets. Apple, which has dominated the 10-inch segment since it introduced the iPad three years ago, responded to phablet competition with the 7.9-inch iPad mini, unveiled in October. Apple has also increased the screen size of the iPhone, though it remains a relatively small 4 inches. Nokia, which pioneered the mobile-phone market in the 1980s, clung to its so-called candy bar handsets a decade ago even as customers were flocking to clamshell phones made by Motorola Inc., Samsung and Sony Ericsson. Its market share fell to a five-year low before recovering as the company released new clamshells and smartphones. Microsoft Linkup After 2007, Nokia’s market share headed south again after it ignored consumer interest in touch screens, spurred by the iPhone. This time, there was no significant recovery. Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop started the current comeback effort two years ago, dropping Nokia’s home-grown operating system in favor of Windows software from his former employer Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) He has also cut more than 20,000 jobs in a bid to revive Nokia after the company fell outside the top five in smartphone rankings and became unprofitable. The strategic shift has yet to reverse market-share losses, though Lumia sales did increase to 4.4 million units last quarter. That’s still a fraction of the 160 million devices shipped by manufacturers using Google Inc.’s Android, led by Samsung, and the 48 million iPhones sold by Apple, according to IDC. Nokia’s fourth-quarter smartphone market share was about 3 percent, according to IDC. Pulling Palm Apple and Samsung have carved out such powerful market positions in smartphones and tablets that simply rolling out a bigger device doesn’t guarantee success, even for a strong brand. BlackBerry failed to dent iPad sales with its PlayBook even as its handsets retain a loyal following. Sales of tablets running Microsoft’s Windows RT software have been disappointing, Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang said last month. Dell Inc.’s Streak, combining the features of a tablet and smartphone, went on sale in 2010 and was discontinued the following year. In 2011, Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) pulled the plug on the TouchPad tablet, which relied on an operating system developed at Palm Inc. “The benchmark is for a larger screen and Nokia isn’t there yet,” said Ben Wood , a research director with London- based consulting firm CCS Insight. “Nokia needs to make sure they don’t miss the boat.” To contact the reporter on this story: Adam Ewing in Stockholm at aewing5@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net",['Adam Ewing'],"Nokia Lacking Five-Inch Screen on Lumia Threatens Revival As Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) claws its way back into the smartphone market with its Lumia handsets, it risks missing the next big trend as consumers shift toward a category the Finnish company has neglected: big-screen handhelds.

Volkswagen to Recall Cars in China Over Gearbox Defects,['Bloomberg News'],2013-03-18 10:44:53,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-16/china-orders-recall-of-volkswagen-cars-with-direct-shift-gearbox.html,"Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe ’s largest automaker, plans to recall vehicles in China after drawing scrutiny from the nation’s quality inspector and state broadcaster over defective gearbox systems. The company will conduct a voluntary recall related to its direct-shift gearbox system, Volkswagen said in March 16 statement, without providing details. The statement came after China’s General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said it told the German automaker to conduct a recall, and after Volkswagen was featured in China Central Television’s annual show about anti-consumer practices - - a program that also featured Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co. this year. The Volkswagen case may test China’s recall laws introduced this year, which give the watchdog broader powers to order investigations and impose fines should manufacturers and importers fail to recall faulty products in a timely manner. The nation’s legislature approved plans last week to expand the authority of the food and drug regulator amid growing public discontent over quality and safety. “Any manufacturer, under the new law, should be aware that there’s an increase in the chances that they’ll be ordered to recall,” said Paolo Beconcini, managing partner at Carroll, Burdick & McDonough LLP in Beijing, whose firm advises European and U.S. automakers on product liability and intellectual property issues in China. Recall Estimate As many as 680,000 units sold in China, including Bora, Golf, Passat and Lavida models, might be equipped with the DSG system involved, according to estimates by auto research LMC Automotive. Volkswagen is currently “figuring out the different scenarios,” Christoph Ludewig, a spokesman for the company in Beijing, said in an e-mail today. “We are in touch with AQSIQ and will announce more when we have details.” The company said in May last year that it had sold almost 1 million DSG-equipped vehicles in China. Chinese owners of VW vehicles fitted with the technology -- a system with two gearboxes that help enhance gear changes and improve fuel economy -- have reported abnormal vibrations, loss of power and sudden acceleration, according to CCTV’s report. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker has addressed issues with the system in China since last year. In May, it said its Chinese division agreed to extend the warranty for the automatic transmission technology to 10 years in response to customer complaints. The standard warranty is two years. Driver Feedback Only a “few hundred” of DSG-fitted vehicles had faults that prompted driver feedback, according to a Bloomberg News interview with Harthmuth Hoffmann, a company spokesman, on May 31. Companies operating in China, both domestic and foreign, are increasingly bracing for the annual CCTV show, broadcast every March 15 for World Consumer Rights Day, as the world’s second-biggest economy continues to expand. Last year, France ’s Carrefour SA (CA) shut an outlet in central China after being featured on CCTV. The year before, Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development Co. shares tumbled 10 percent after CCTV reported the company bought pigs that were fed an illegal additive. The broadcast comes as China ushers in new state leadership for the first time in a decade, with Premier Li Keqiang yesterday pledging to improve consumer safety by tackling food problems and the environment with an “iron fist.” Gearbox Problems In its March 16 statement, the Chinese quality watchdog didn’t say how many Volkswagen vehicles would be involved in the recall and calls to its news department seeking comment went unanswered over the weekend. The regulator said it will compel the automaker to call back the vehicles if it doesn’t comply. In its March 15 program, CCTV also investigated alleged flaws in the after-sales service of Cupertino, California-based Apple. Carolyn Wu, the company’s spokeswoman in Beijing, said the company has established a network of more than 500 authorized service centers in 270 cities across China to provide “unmatched” support to owners of its devices. “Apple is dedicated to making the best products in the world and delivering unmatched customer service everywhere we do business,” Wu said in a phone interview today. “Our team is always striving to exceed our customers’ expectations, and we take any customer concerns very seriously.” Apple Sales Apple slipped to sixth place from fourth in China’s smartphone market in the third quarter of 2012. Samsung leads the China smartphone market in share, and four domestic suppliers also now outsell the iPhone in the nation, according to market researcher IDC. Even so, Apple’s sales in China in its fiscal first quarter climbed 67 percent from a year earlier to $6.83 billion, the company said in January. CCTV said in its broadcast that Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co. sold cars with rusted chassis. The company said in a statement on its website on March 16 that a “lack of experience” resulted in the failure to ensure the body structure was properly painted to put off rust. The company said it has fixed the rust issue of 6,579 affected vehicles and will work with the quality regulator to issue a recall. The consumer program also reported on impure gold made in a workshop in Shenzhen and sold in shops in Tianjin and Hebei, and on some Chinese medical companies, including one in Henan province, who hired actors to masquerade as doctors to promote products. CCTV also investigated the use of substandard concrete by some developers in the southern city of Shenzhen who used low- quality sea sand instead of river sand. The Shenzhen Housing and Construction Bureau found 31 concrete-mixing plants violated industry rules, according to a statement posted on its website on March 16.

Sony to Offer Smaller PlayStation 3 for Holiday Season,['Mariko Yasu'],2012-09-19 09:29:04,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/sony-to-sell-smaller-playstation-3-console-for-holiday-season.html,"Sony Corp. (6758) will sell a smaller, lighter version of the PlayStation 3 console this holiday season as it tries to win back customers flocking to games played on mobile devices and personal computers. The new consoles, which have more storage capacity than current models, will go on sale Sept. 25 in North America at $249 for 250 gigabytes of storage and $299 for 500 gigabytes, the company said today. Sony will also start the “PlayStation Mobile” service, through which users can download games on their smartphones and tablet computers, on Oct. 3, Andrew House, head of the games business, said in Tokyo. The games unit is among the focus areas listed this year by Kazuo Hirai , 51, who became Sony’s chief executive officer in April and started reforming the unprofitable television operation and cutting 10,000 jobs. The Tokyo-based company is trying to return to profit following four straight annual losses after the yen gained, the global economy slowed and consumers switched to Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. devices. “Sony is probably trying to lure consumers with the new model after Nintendo released its Wii U,” said Takashi Oka, a Tokyo-based analyst at TIW Inc. “Still, game-console markets have matured in developed nations and it may be hard to stimulate demand just by making it smaller.” Nintendo’s Release The Wii U, Nintendo Co.’s latest console, will go on sale in the U.S. Nov. 18, priced from $300, the Osaka-based company said Sept. 13. Nintendo, the world’s biggest maker of video-game machines, said it will introduce new titles for the player, such as “ Super Mario ” and “Call of Duty.” The smaller PS3 will make its debut in Europe on Sept. 28 and in Japan on Oct. 4, Sony said. The game-console industry faces competition from titles played online and on smartphones from companies including Apple, whose latest iPhone 5 is scheduled to reach stores in the U.S. this week. Sony is also offering titles for Android-powered devices to extend its reach beyond users of game consoles. Its “PlayStation Mobile” Android service, renamed in June from “PlayStation Suite,” will be available next month in nine nations including the U.S., Canada , Germany , Australia and Japan, Sony said today. The service allows users to download and play titles made by Sony and third-party developers, it said. Makers of devices that allow the service include HTC Corp., Asustek Computer Inc., Sharp Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd., said Satoshi Nakajima, a spokesman for Sony’s games unit. Sony also said it will cut the price for its PlayStation Portable players, by 18 percent to 13,800 yen ($175), from tomorrow in Japan. Cloud Services Sony is preparing to offer new cloud-based gaming services, House said today. He didn’t elaborate. The company agreed in July to acquire Gaikai Inc., a U.S. gaming-platform company, for about $380 million. The transaction was completed Aug. 10, Nakajima said. Sony, which bought out a mobile-phone venture from Ericsson AB for 1.05 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in February, plans to draw on its skills in games to develop new smartphones and tablet computers, Kunimasa Suzuki, an executive vice president overseeing mobile products, said earlier this month. Last month, the Japanese electronics maker cut its full- year sales target for handheld game players, including the PS Vita, to 12 million units from 16 million predicted three months earlier. The company also lowered its target for TVs, compact cameras and PCs. The operating loss , or sales minus the cost of goods sold and administrative expenses, at Sony’s game unit was 3.5 billion yen in the three months ended June 30, compared with an income of 4.1 billion yen a year earlier, the company said in August.

"ZTE, Mozilla Plan Mobile System to Compete With Android",['Bloomberg News'],2012-09-19 08:07:26,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/zte-mozilla-plan-mobile-system-to-compete-with-android.html,"ZTE Corp. (000063) , China’s second-biggest maker of phone equipment, will release a new mobile operating system with the developer of the Firefox web browser to compete with Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software. The software will be available in the December quarter, ZTE Executive Vice President He Shiyou told a briefing in Beijing today. Closely held Mozilla Corp. makes Firefox. ZTE is in talks with overseas carriers to offer devices with the new operating system to reduce its reliance on Android as it expects smartphone sales will double this year amid market share gains in Europe, North America , Brazil and Japan. ZTE is expanding in mobile devices and cloud computing where sales growth is faster than its traditional equipment business as the pace of new network rollouts slows. “We will not rely on only one operating system,” He said. The Shenzhen-based company uses Android on about 90 percent of its smartphones with the rest using Microsoft Corp.’s Windows Mobile. ZTE rose 5 percent to HK$11.26 at the close in Hong Kong trading. The stock has dropped 54 percent this year, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index has gained 13 percent. ‘Unrealistic Strategy’ The challenges confronting ZTE to build an operating system that can compete with Android, Windows Phone or Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iOS will be considerable, not the least of which is establishing a community of developers to make games and other apps for the devices. As app developers are already committed to to the existing systems, ZTE’s plan is “a very unrealistic strategy,” said Pierre Ferragu , a London-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in London. “Operating systems follow winner-take-all rules,” Ferragu said in an e-mail today. “How can an operating system limited to a small, low-end manufacturer gain traction ever? It will most likely play against ZTE as consumers want Android, or at best be a non-event if they continue to do Android and Windows at the same time.” Huawei Technologies Huawei Technologies Co., China’s biggest telephone equipment maker, said on Sept. 12 it had no immediate plan for a mobile operating system following a report on the Sohu.com website that it would develop a backup to Android. By 2015, mobile devices will account for 50 percent of ZTE’s sales, up from 40 percent this year, He said in April. In the second quarter, ZTE smartphone shipments in the China market rose to third place from fourth, behind Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , Lenovo Group Ltd.

(000063) , China’s second-biggest maker of phone equipment, will release a new mobile operating system with the developer of the Firefox web browser to compete with Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software. The software will be available in the December quarter, ZTE Executive Vice President He Shiyou told a briefing in Beijing today. Closely held Mozilla Corp. makes Firefox. ZTE is in talks with overseas carriers to offer devices with the new operating system to reduce its reliance on Android as it expects smartphone sales will double this year amid market share gains in Europe, North America , Brazil and Japan. ZTE is expanding in mobile devices and cloud computing where sales growth is faster than its traditional equipment business as the pace of new network rollouts slows. “We will not rely on only one operating system,” He said. The Shenzhen-based company uses Android on about 90 percent of its smartphones with the rest using Microsoft Corp.’s Windows Mobile. ZTE rose 5 percent to HK$11.26 at the close in Hong Kong trading. The stock has dropped 54 percent this year, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index has gained 13 percent. ‘Unrealistic Strategy’ The challenges confronting ZTE to build an operating system that can compete with Android, Windows Phone or Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iOS will be considerable, not the least of which is establishing a community of developers to make games and other apps for the devices. As app developers are already committed to to the existing systems, ZTE’s plan is “a very unrealistic strategy,” said Pierre Ferragu , a London-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in London. “Operating systems follow winner-take-all rules,” Ferragu said in an e-mail today. “How can an operating system limited to a small, low-end manufacturer gain traction ever? It will most likely play against ZTE as consumers want Android, or at best be a non-event if they continue to do Android and Windows at the same time.” Huawei Technologies Huawei Technologies Co., China’s biggest telephone equipment maker, said on Sept. 12 it had no immediate plan for a mobile operating system following a report on the Sohu.com website that it would develop a backup to Android.

"Apple, Four Publishers Bid to End EU Price-Fixing Probe",['Aoife White'],2012-09-19 11:46:41,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/apple-four-publishers-bid-to-end-eu-price-fixing-probe.html,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the world’s biggest technology company, and four publishers offered to overhaul pricing models for digital books to allay European Union concerns that they blocked competition. The publishers won’t limit retailers’ discounts for two years under details of proposals by Apple, CBS Corp.’s Simon & Schuster, News Corp. (NWSA) ’s HarperCollins, Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH’s Macmillan unit and Lagardere SCA (MMB) ’s Hachette Livre published today in the EU’s Official Journal. The European Commission said they first made an offer to settle its investigation in April. Facing EU pressure, Apple has promised to terminate so- called agency agreements with the four companies and Pearson, it said in its proposal. Under Apple’s pricing strategy, the iPad maker takes a fixed percentage of e-book prices set by the publishers. “The commission took the preliminary view that, by jointly switching the sale of e-books from a wholesale model to an agency model with the same key terms on a global basis, the four publishers and Apple engaged in a concerted practice with the object of raising retail prices” and preventing the emergence of lower prices for e-books, the Brussels-based agency said. The EU is asking rivals and customers to comment on the offer by Oct. 19 before accepting it, which would end the EU’s investigation without imposing fines or determining that the companies violated competition rules. Penguin Probe Regulators continue to probe Pearson Plc (PSON) ’s Penguin, which hasn’t offered to settle, the EU said in a separate statement. The antitrust agency last year opened the probe to examine Cupertino, California-based Apple’s deals with publishers and the publishers’ deals with retailers. While the Holtzbrinck group has denied all charges of collusion over e-books it believes “it is in the best interests of our European business to proceed towards a settlement,” Joyce Lorigan, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. HarperCollins said it was “working with the EU to find a solution,” according to an e-mail from spokeswoman Siobhan Kenny. Hachette Livre is “convinced that it didn’t violate competition law at any time,’” the company said in a statement on its website. It said it was offering to settle with the EU to avoid a contentious, costly and long process. Apple and Simon & Schuster didn’t immediately respond to e- mails seeking comment. Discounts Under the proposed settlement, the four publishers won’t limit e-book retailers’ discounts or promotions for two years as long as the total value of a retailer’s discount doesn’t exceed the commission it received from the publisher over a 12-month period. The four publishers also commit to terminate any restrictive agency deals with retailers. Apple said in its proposal that its entry into the e- book market “brought needed competition to a market occupied by a single reseller” and it “strongly contests” that it violated competition rules. It said it was modifying agency agreements “to resolve the uncertainty caused by the commission’s investigation.” The U.S. Department of Justice sued Apple, Macmillan and Pearson’s Penguin in New York earlier this year, claiming the publishers colluded to fix e-book prices. Simon & Schuster, Hachette and HarperCollins reached settlements with the DOJ. Music Downloads PricewaterhouseCoopers said last year that European e-book sales have been sluggish, partly because of the small range of non-English titles and fixed price agreements between publishers and stores in 13 countries. The EU’s antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia has said he wants to fight “artificial restrictions imposed by some companies to cross-border trade.” Apple previously settled an EU antitrust case in 2009 by agreeing to reduce prices for U.K. iTunes music downloads and was probed over restrictions on iPhone applications in a case the EU closed last year.

Dell Unveils 3 Computers Running Microsoft’s Windows 8 Software,['Aaron Ricadela'],2012-09-19 11:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/dell-unveils-3-computers-running-microsoft-s-windows-8-software.html,"Dell Inc. (DELL) unveiled three computers based on Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s new Windows 8 software, including a tablet sporting a 10-inch screen for corporate users, a notebook that weighs less than four pounds and an all-in-one desktop. Dell’s Latitude 10 tablet, set to debut this year for business users, features Intel Corp. (INTC) ’s Atom chip and runs Windows 8, which is designed to work better with tablets. The company’s fall lineup will also include the Latitude 6430u laptop, a thin and light Ultrabook design, and the OptiPlex 9010, which houses its electronics, power supply and 23-inch touch screen inside one chassis. Dell and other personal-computer makers are counting on Windows 8 to jog anemic growth as consumers and businesses increasingly opt for Apple Inc.’s iPad and other tablets. Global PC shipments this year may increase just 1 percent to 367 million units, market researcher IDC said last month, down from a previous projection of 5 percent growth. Dell, whose own PC sales declined 14 percent in the fiscal second quarter, said its Windows 8 tablet for businesses will be available this year. No. 1 PC maker Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) has said its Windows 8 tablet for businesses may not be available until January. “We’re already sampling to customers -- we will ship this year,” said Neil Hand, a Dell vice president of product marketing, at a demonstration of new Windows 8 devices in San Francisco. Device Options The Latitude 10 includes options for a longer-lasting battery and a dock featuring additional ports for connecting to printers, screens and other equipment Hand said. The 6430u Ultrabook features a 14-inch screen, replaceable battery and optional wireless docking system for use in an office. The all-in-one OptiPlex 9010 desktop machine can be placed on a desk or mounted on a wall, Hand said. Last month at a Berlin trade show, Dell showed off several other devices based on the new Windows operating system. The Round Rock , Texas-based company previewed a tablet based on Windows RT software -- a version of Windows designed for chips running ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) ’s technology -- as well as an Intel- based convertible Windows 8 tablet that flips around to reveal a keyboard.

BlackBerry Creator Lazaridis Puts $100 Million Into Nano Labs,['Hugo Miller'],2012-09-20 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/blackberry-creator-lazaridis-puts-100-million-toward-nano-plan.html,"Mike Lazaridis , whose invention of the BlackBerry smartphone more than a decade ago redefined the way people send e-mail, is drawing inspiration from the early days of computing for his next act. Backed by his $100 million donation, the Mike & Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre opens tomorrow in Waterloo, Ontario, aiming to recreate the conditions that made AT&T Inc.’s Bell Labs a hive of technological innovation in the early 1960s and laid the groundwork for the success of Silicon Valley. The new research center is designed to produce breakthroughs in the science and technology of things approaching the size of an atom. It’s “absolutely” going to be the Bell Labs of the 21st century, Lazaridis said yesterday in a telephone interview. “That reality got clearer and clearer to me as we got closer to the ribbon-cutting.” Lazaridis, who resigned as chairman of struggling BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) in January, says he’s now devoting most of his time to help get the Quantum-Nano Centre off the ground and to form a cluster of cutting-edge research with the decade-old Institute for Quantum Computing and Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics , both founded with a total of more than $250 million of his own money and additional funds he helped raise. The facilities will be enough to lure the brightest minds in the field to Canada , Lazaridis said. No Mountains “We can’t offer them ocean, beaches or mountains, but we can try and offer them the best environment, the best collaborators, the best equipment that would be conducive to them making the breakthroughs of their lifetime,” Lazaridis said. “One of the best ways to describe this is we’re trying to break the known laws of physics.” The technology Lazaridis is talking about is designed to redefine the boundaries of Moore’s Law, the principle -- associated with Intel Corp. (INTC) co-founder Gordon Moore -- that the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit doubles every two years. Quantum computing and nanotechnology would allow medicine to be delivered to individual cells, could create minute energy sources and could even produce self-healing materials that could be used in a nuclear power plant, he says. “It’s getting more and more difficult to make smaller devices as we approach the size of an atom, but it’s also getting more expensive to build those devices,” he said. “You know you’re at the limit when those two things happen. The only way we can break through those barriers is quantum computing.” Possible Investments While Lazaridis said he’s considering investments in nano and quantum technology, he wouldn’t say when or how much he’ll invest. The 51-year-old still owns 29.7 million shares in RIM, which are worth about $214 million, according to an April filing. “I do have the funds to invest in both angel and venture capital , but I’m being very, very strategic,” he said. While Waterloo does have some local venture capital that startups can tap, it lacks the billion of dollars in venture capital that investors are willing to risk in Silicon Valley on local startups. That doesn’t faze Lazaridis, the son of Greek immigrants who immigrated to Canada as a boy and started RIM while still at the University of Waterloo in the 1970s. “The venture capital will find its way to those individual entrepreneurs or companies that are interested in commercializing these discoveries,” he said. Valley’s Roots Bell Labs , founded in 1925 and now part of Alcatel-Lucent, had its operations in New York City and the New Jersey suburbs, an area that hasn’t been able to seize the mantle of technological innovator held by California ’s Silicon Valley, home to Intel, Apple Inc. and Google Inc. Bell Labs alumni such as William Shockley helped bring the research center’s innovations to the West Coast. In Waterloo, other companies are championing the growth of the technology industry as RIM continues to shrink, with users switching to devices from Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. Desire2Learn Inc., a local online-education software startup, raised $80 million in venture funding this month from investors including Menlo Park , California-based New Enterprise Associates Inc. Waterloo-based OpenText Corp., a 20-year-old maker of business software , saw revenue grow 17 percent to $1.21 billion in its most recent fiscal year and employs more than 4,500 workers worldwide. The two provide a morale boost to the local economy as RIM cuts 5,000 jobs to try to return to profitability. Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins, who took over in January, is counting on a new lineup of phones, due next year, to reverse the company’s fortunes. Lazaridis, who remains on the board of RIM and runs its innovation committee, says he still regularly consults with Heins, who he picked as his successor. While he declined to say if he’s happier being able to devote himself full-time to pure science and philanthropy rather than running RIM, he said he’s enjoying his new project. “Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be part of this adventure,” he said. “I wouldn’t have it any other way.” To contact the reporter on this story: Hugo Miller in Toronto at  hugomiller@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Nick Turner at  nturner7@bloomberg.net",['Hugo Miller'],"BlackBerry Creator Lazaridis Puts $100 Million Into Nano Labs Mike Lazaridis , whose invention of the BlackBerry smartphone more than a decade ago redefined the way people send e-mail, is drawing inspiration from the early days of computing for his next act.

Salesforce Unveils New Cloud Products as Rivals Move In,['Aaron Ricadela'],2012-09-19 20:09:31,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/salesforce-unveils-new-cloud-products-as-rivals-move-in.html,"Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) said it’s releasing a new version of its software for tablet computers and unifying its social-media marketing products into a single suite, as it races to stay ahead of new market entrants. Larger rivals Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and SAP AG (SAP) are moving onto Salesforce’s turf using acquisitions, aiming to take part of the market for business software delivered over the Internet, estimated to be worth $49 billion -- up 25 percent from last year -- according to a Sept. 10 Forrester Research Inc. report. Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff unveiled the new products today at the company’s Dreamforce conference in San Francisco, where Salesforce is based. Benioff also plans to outline features of a new human resources software called Work.com, and an online storage product called Chatterbox. “What he needs to convince investors of is that he’s got enough market opportunity to keep growing north of 30 percent” a year in sales, said Pat Walravens, an analyst at JMP Securities LLC in San Francisco. “He needs to enter new markets.” Salesforce, which sells software over the Internet instead of as a packaged product, will offer its customer management tools via Salesforce Touch on Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad and other tablets using HTML 5, a standard that delivers richer graphics and features over the Web. Its new Marketing Cloud software deploys social-media tools for companies to collect and share information, Salesforce said in a statement. Crowded Arena Salesforce is working to annex new areas of online software for businesses. At the conference, which runs through Sept. 21, Benioff plans to show how the new Marketing Cloud software combines functions from the acquisitions of Radian6 Technologies Inc. and Buddy Media Inc. into a single suite for marketing on social-media sites such as Facebook Inc. (FB) and Twitter Inc. It’s also extending its Chatter business social networking software for use in customer service scenarios and through supply chains. In mobile applications, Salesforce is delivering its Touch applications after a delay. Announced a year ago at the last Dreamforce conference, they were due to be delivered early this year. In one presentation, Benioff showed how General Electric Co. (GE) is outfitting jet engines and other equipment to broadcast status updates its engineers can monitor. GE’s CEO, Jeffrey Immelt , speaks at the conference tomorrow. “They could have a social network around an aircraft engine,” Benioff said. “It was an unusual idea.” HR Push Competition is also intensifying. Oracle, SAP and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) have been buying companies that offer business management tools over the Web, gaining traction in an area Salesforce pioneered. SAP in February bought online HR software maker SuccessFactors Inc. for $3.4 billion, and Microsoft in July bought Yammer Inc. for $1.2 billion to gain business social networking software. Oracle on Sept. 17 said it would buy SelectMinds Inc., a maker of online recruiting software, for an undisclosed amount. Workday Inc. (WDAY) , which filed last month for its initial public offering, recently landed a deal with Google Inc. to supply human resources software for tens of thousands of employees at the search engine provider. Last month, Salesforce forecast profit for the fiscal third quarter ending in October that missed analysts’ estimates as the company increases sales and marketing spending. Shares of Salesforce rose 1.1 percent to $157.98 at the close in New York, and are up 56 percent this year.

SAP in February bought online HR software maker SuccessFactors Inc. for $3.4 billion, and Microsoft in July bought Yammer Inc. for $1.2 billion to gain business social networking software. Oracle on Sept. 17 said it would buy SelectMinds Inc., a maker of online recruiting software, for an undisclosed amount. Workday Inc. (WDAY) , which filed last month for its initial public offering, recently landed a deal with Google Inc. to supply human resources software for tens of thousands of employees at the search engine provider. Last month, Salesforce forecast profit for the fiscal third quarter ending in October that missed analysts’ estimates as the company increases sales and marketing spending. Shares of Salesforce rose 1.1 percent to $157.98 at the close in New York, and are up 56 percent this year.

"IPhone 5 Costliest to Make Since Original Model, IHS Data Shows",['Tim Culpan'],2012-09-19 07:49:27,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/iphone-5-costliest-to-make-since-original-model-ihs-data-shows.html,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s latest model iPhone 5 is the company’s most expensive handset to manufacture since the first version was released in 2007, according to data from market researcher IHS iSuppli. A larger, more-advanced screen and faster wireless chips drove the materials and manufacturing cost of the 16 GB entry- level iPhone 5 to $207, the El Segundo, California-based researcher said in a statement based on preliminary estimates. That’s the most expensive since Apple unveiled the iPhone in 2007, which iSuppli estimated at the time had material costs of $246 for a 4 GB version. Apple, which gets about two-thirds of its profit from handsets, said it pre-sold 2 million units of the iPhone 5 in one day, more than double its previous record. Although production costs are the highest in three years, manufacturing and bill-of-materials expenses for the entry-level model are 32 percent of the non-contract sales price of $649, according to iSuppli estimates. “While the price of some components, such as NAND flash, has fallen during the past year, the iPhone 5’s overall BOM has increased mainly because its display and wireless subsystems are more expensive compared to the iPhone 4S,” iSuppli said. The estimates are based on a “virtual teardown” and may be amended after a physical examination of the device and its components, the researcher said. Deliveries of the new model begin Sept. 21. Manufacturing Costs Carolyn Wu, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Apple, declined to comment. The Cupertino, California-based company doesn’t currently list non-contract prices for the iPhone 5 on its U.S. website, with orders only available through contracts with carriers. Materials for the cheapest of the new handsets, with 16 gigabytes of storage, total $199 and manufacturing cost is $8, according to iSuppli. The combined cost rises to $238 for the 64 GB version, which sells for $849, because the extra storage is more expensive, according to the researcher’s preliminary analysis based on known suppliers and prices for components, it said. The cheapest version of Apple’s original iPhone , unveiled in 2007, had 4 Gigabytes of storage, one-quarter the amount of the least-expensive iPhone 5. A more expensive version of the original, with 8 GB, had parts and manufacturing costs of $265.83, iSuppli said in a follow-up to its earlier analysis. Apple has in the past criticized similar cost analysis of its devices. “Don’t put a lot of credence in these third-party reports that you see,” Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer said in a July 20, 2010 investor conference call. “It’s always amazing to me the cost categories and the components that never seem to make it into the reports.” Chip Prices The analysis doesn’t include software, royalty, licensing and other expenses, iSuppli said. Costs estimates also exclude research, marketing, administrative and other expenses incurred by Apple in designing and selling its products. Combined costs of wireless chips climbed to $34 from $24 for the iPhone 4S, while the display and touchscreen costs $44 compared to $37 for the prior version, iSuppli said. Falling prices of memory chips cut the cost of storage for the most-expensive model, with 64 GB, by 45 percent from the 4S model to $41.60 in the latest version, it said. The cheapest iPhone 4S had a materials and manufacturing cost of $196, it said in October. To contact the reporter on this story: Tim Culpan in Taipei at  tculpan1@bloomberg.net.

Groupon Debuts Credit-Card Payments Service for Merchants,['Ryan Faughnder' 'Douglas Mac Millan'],2012-09-19 20:32:50,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/groupon-debuts-credit-card-payments-service-for-merchants.html,"Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , the largest daily- deals website, is introducing a credit-card reader to vie with products offered by Square Inc. and EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s PayPal service and boost revenue from small businesses. The company will charge U.S. merchants that use its coupons lower fees than Square and PayPal, according to a statement today from Chicago-based Groupon. The reader is also compatible with Apple Inc.’s iPhone and iPod Touch. Groupon, which has been testing the service in San Francisco, is seeking new sources of revenue as diminished demand for daily deals causes sales to fall short of analysts’ predictions. The new service, Groupon Payments, is designed to make the company more appealing to existing clients and potential new ones. “For the small merchants, credit card transactions have always been extremely expensive,” said Sameet Sinha , an analyst at B. Riley & Co., in a telephone interview. Existing Groupon customers that use the reader will pay transaction fees of 1.8 percent plus 15 cents for cards from Visa Inc., MasterCard Inc. and Discover Financial Services, For American Express Co. cards, fees will be 3 percent plus 15 cents. Card readers offered by Square charge 2.75 percent per transaction, while PayPal has a 2.7 percent fee. Groupon rose 14 percent to $5.34 at the close in New York. The stock has declined 74 percent so far this year. The company makes money by selling discounts -- known as Groupons -- from businesses such as restaurants and nail salons. It then splits the revenue with the retailers. ‘Slash Complexity’ “We talk to a lot of Groupon merchants and the one thing that came up again and again was that they felt like they were paying too much for credit-card processing,” Mihir Shah, vice president of mobile and merchant products at Groupon, said in an interview. “We set out on this mission to slash the complexity and cost of collecting credit cards.” Businesses that use Groupon’s card-reader without offering deals through its website will be charged a 2.2 percent fee plus 15 cents per transaction for Visa, MasterCard and Discover. The American Express fee will be 3 percent. The company has tested the service with dozens of merchants in the San Francisco Bay Area, a person familiar with the matter said in May. Groupon can afford to charge a lower rate because its business already supports a large sales staff and other costs associated with rolling out a payment product to hundreds of merchants, Shah said. Free Readers “We already have the sales force, we have the distribution advantage, we have the relationship with the merchant,” Shah said. “All we have to do is turn on the service.” Groupon is giving away card readers that are made by Roam Data Inc. and plug into the headphone jack of Apple devices, Shah said. It will sell more advanced readers made by Irvine , California-based Infinite Peripherals Inc. for $100 apiece, he said. Merchants using Groupon Payments will be able to analyze transaction history, check daily sales reports and review revenue trends. Groupon said credit card payments will be deposited overnight in vendors’ bank accounts, faster than the typical delay of two to three business days. “Now the merchants can track the time of purchases and what time the customers walked through their door, how many people were with them and what they bought,” Sinha said. “That’s incredibly valuable data.” Such data has the potential to backfire if it also shows merchants that offering discounts through Groupon is ineffective, Sinha said. “If you give people more transparency,” he said, “you may discover it doesn’t work.” To contact the reporters on this story: Ryan Faughnder in New York at  rfaughnder@bloomberg.net ; Douglas MacMillan in San Francisco at  dmacmillan3@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net",['Ryan FaughnderDouglas Mac Millan'],"Groupon Debuts Credit-Card Payments Service for Merchants Groupon Inc.

"Google, Hitachi Metals, Samsung: Intellectual Property",['Victoria Slind-Flor'],2012-09-19 11:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/google-hitachi-metals-samsung-intellectual-property.html,"Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s patent-infringement complaint targeting Apple Inc. devices, including ones that have the Siri voice-recognition program, will be investigated by a U.S. trade agency. The U.S. International Trade Commission said yesterday it has begun a formal probe of the complaint filed Aug. 17 by Google’s Motorola Mobility unit. Notice of the investigation was posted on the agency’s website. Motorola Mobility has said it hopes the complaint puts pressure on Apple to negotiate a cross-licensing deal. The companies have been fighting since at least 2010 after licensing talks failed. Google bought Motorola Mobility to get access to its trove of patents as a bulwark against Apple claims that devices running on Google’s Android operating system are copying unique features of the iPhone. The handset maker, which Google bought in May for $12.5 billion, claims Apple infringed seven of its patents on features including interactive voice commands, location reminders, e-mail notification and phone/video players. The case seeks a ban on U.S. imports of devices including the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers. Apple’s products are made in Asia. The complaint filed last month didn’t name the iPhone 5 because it won’t be in retail stores until Sept. 21. ITC rules could let Motorola Mobility add the iPhone5 to the list of devices accused of infringing the patents. Apple has said Motorola Mobility is making unreasonable demands for royalties of 2.25 percent of the retail price of every device. The Cupertino, California-based company is appealing an ITC case it lost that claimed Motorola Mobility’s Android phones infringed Apple patents. Motorola Mobility has a second case against Apple at the agency. It lost on the issue of whether Apple devices infringed Motorola Mobility patents that cover wireless technologies used throughout the industry. The commission last month ordered a judge to review whether there was infringement of a patent related to a sensor that prevents accidental hang-ups or dialing. The new case is In the Matter of Wireless Communication Devices, Portable Music and Data Processing devices, Computers, and Components Thereof, 337-856, and the earlier case is In the Matter of Certain Wireless Communication Devices, Portable Music Data, Processing Data Devices, Computers and Components Thereof, 337-745. Both are in the U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). Hitachi Metals Rare-Earth Magnet Complaint to Be Probed by U.S. Hitachi Metals Ltd. (5486) ’s complaint seeking to block U.S. imports of competitors’ rare-earth magnets used in electronics, golf ball markers and power tools will be investigated by the International Trade Commission. The commission said yesterday it started a probe into the case filed Aug. 17 by the Japanese maker of specialty-metal products against more than two dozen companies. Notice of the decision was posted on the agency’s website. The dispute is over patented inventions related to the manufacture of sintered rare-earth magnets, which are light and powerful compounds used in batteries, magnets and computer hard drives. Hitachi is seeking to block products that are using rare-earth metals from China , where 95 percent of all such materials are mined and processed. Hitachi Metals, based in Tokyo , said in the complaint it has an agreement to make the magnets with Molycorp Inc. (MCP) , the owner of the only rare-earth mine in the U.S., and plans to begin production in 2013. Companies named in the complaint objected, saying any import ban would harm public health because the magnets are used in robotic surgical systems, radiation equipment, surgical microscopes and insulin pumps. “Hitachi Metals seeks a dramatic remedy threatening a massive upset to the national economy,” audio-equipment seller Skullcandy Inc. (SKUL) said in a filing with the agency. The complaint names Chinese companies that mine or use the metals, as well as firms that import or make products that use them. They include Skullcandy, Harman International Industries Inc. (HAR) and Bose Corp., and athletic-gear makers Callaway Golf Co. (ELY) , Taylor Made Golf Co. and Adidas AG. (ADS)  Molycorp is working to reopen a rare-earth mine in Mountain Pass, California , that closed in 2002 because Chinese exports caused global prices to plunge, according to Hitachi Metals. More recently, prices have risen and the U.S. Congress has been calling for an increase in domestic production. Hitachi Metals said it and other suppliers would be able to make up for any loss of available products if the rare-earth magnets from China are halted at the U.S. border. The case is In the Matter of Sintered Rare Earth Magnets, 337-855, U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). Samsung Fails to Defeat Galaxy Tab Sales Ban in Apple Case Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) lost its bid to persuade a federal judge in California to lift a preliminary ban on U.S. sales of its Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer imposed as part of a patent dispute with Apple Inc. (AAPL)  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose , California, issued the order temporarily blocking sales of the Tab 10.1 computer before a jury found Aug. 24 that Samsung infringed six of seven Apple patents and awarded Apple $1.05 billion in damages. Apple and Samsung agree that a pending appeal temporarily “deprives the court of jurisdiction to dissolve the injunction,” Koh wrote in an order Sept. 17. Lifting the ban during the appeal only to re-impose it later “would cause confusion in the market and is not necessary to prevent irreparable harm,” Cupertino, California-based Apple argued in a filing. Koh has scheduled a hearing Dec. 6 to consider Apple’s request for a permanent U.S. sales ban on eight of Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung’s smartphone models and the tablet. The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11- cv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). For more patent news, click here. Trademark Neiman Marcus Objects to ‘Last Call’ in Charity Thrift Shop Name Neiman Marcus Group Inc. sent a cease-and-desist letter to a South Carolina thrift shop connected with a women’s shelter, South Carolina’s State newspaper reported. The luxury-goods retailer objects to the shop’s name -- “ Revente’s Last Call ” -- which the Dallas-based company claims could be confused with its “Last Call” clearance store, according to the State. Ginger Reeder, a Neiman Marcus spokeswoman, said the company wasn’t trying to shut down the thrift shop and seeks an amicable resolution to protect its trademark, the newspaper reported. State Representative James Smith , who is also an attorney, is representing the thrift shop pro bono and told the State that he was hopeful the parties could come to agreement and the shop could keep its name. Yahoo Removes Trademark Symbol From Company Logo Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , the Internet media company, has taken the trademark symbol off its logo, the TechCrunch technology news website reported. Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer used Twitter Inc.’s service to send out a message saying one of the company’s new employees had “gone on a mission” to remove all the trademark symbols from Yahoo’s campus, according to TechCrunch. She said that the Sunnyvale, California-based company’s use of the symbol had “bugged” the new employee, and that its removal wasn’t viewed with alarm by Yahoo’s legal staff, TechCrunch reported. “Legal assures us our trademark is implied and quite secure,” Mayer said, according to TechCrunch. Jetstar Opposes Toyota’s Jumping ‘Oh, What a Feeling!’ Trademark Jetstar Airways Pty Ltd., a low-cost airline based in Sunshine, Australia, is opposing Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s application to register “Oh, What a Feeling!” in connection with jumping actors as a trademark, the eTravel Blackboard website reported. Jetstar has used jumping actors since 2004, while Toyota has had ads with actors leaping since the mid-1980s, the website reported. Toyota spokesman Glenn Campbell said the company filed its application to register the mark earlier this year, according to eTravel Blackboard. Jetstar said its use of a jump in ads is an iconic symbol of the company and has been used in a number of Asian countries in addition to Australia and New Zealand, the website reported.

Copyright Pirate Party Member Uses DMCA to Halt Unauthorized Book Copies A member of the German branch of the anti-copyright Pirate Party , whose book “Click Me” is being published by a unit of Verlagsgruppe Random House GmbH, is enforcing her copyright in cyberspace, Spiegel Online reported. Julia Schramm , who has called the idea of intellectual property “disgusting” and received a 100,000-euro ($131,000) advance for the work, had a Sept. 17 release date for the book, according to Spiegel Online. Initially, unauthorized copies of the book were circulating on the Internet, with the link to the site from which it could be downloaded spread through social media, Spiegel Online reported. By the end of the day Sept. 17, visitors who followed the link were met with a notice that the file was no longer available because of a takedown request made by the author under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Spiegel Online reported. Copyright Costs Meant No Art Images in Art History Textbook First-year students at OCAD University , a Toronto-based school focused on art and design education, are paying C$180 ($185) for a required art history book that contains no illustrations because of copyright issues, Canada’s National Post reported. The book, “Global Visual and Cultural Material Culture: Prehistory to 1800,” contains blank spaces where illustrations normally would appear, according to the National Post. The dean of the school’s Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences said that the choice not to include images in the custom-made textbook was economic, because the fees to reproduce the images would have doubled the cost, the National Post reported. A comparable text for the next term, covering post-1800 art, will also cost C$180 and lack artwork, the dean said, according to the National Post. For more copyright news, click here.

(SKUL) said in a filing with the agency. The complaint names Chinese companies that mine or use the metals, as well as firms that import or make products that use them. They include Skullcandy, Harman International Industries Inc. (HAR) and Bose Corp., and athletic-gear makers Callaway Golf Co. (ELY) , Taylor Made Golf Co. and Adidas AG. (ADS)  Molycorp is working to reopen a rare-earth mine in Mountain Pass, California , that closed in 2002 because Chinese exports caused global prices to plunge, according to Hitachi Metals. More recently, prices have risen and the U.S. Congress has been calling for an increase in domestic production. Hitachi Metals said it and other suppliers would be able to make up for any loss of available products if the rare-earth magnets from China are halted at the U.S. border. The case is In the Matter of Sintered Rare Earth Magnets, 337-855, U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). Samsung Fails to Defeat Galaxy Tab Sales Ban in Apple Case Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) lost its bid to persuade a federal judge in California to lift a preliminary ban on U.S. sales of its Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer imposed as part of a patent dispute with Apple Inc. (AAPL)  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose , California, issued the order temporarily blocking sales of the Tab 10.1 computer before a jury found Aug. 24 that Samsung infringed six of seven Apple patents and awarded Apple $1.05 billion in damages. Apple and Samsung agree that a pending appeal temporarily “deprives the court of jurisdiction to dissolve the injunction,” Koh wrote in an order Sept. 17. Lifting the ban during the appeal only to re-impose it later “would cause confusion in the market and is not necessary to prevent irreparable harm,” Cupertino, California-based Apple argued in a filing. Koh has scheduled a hearing Dec. 6 to consider Apple’s request for a permanent U.S. sales ban on eight of Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung’s smartphone models and the tablet. The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11- cv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). For more patent news, click here. Trademark Neiman Marcus Objects to ‘Last Call’ in Charity Thrift Shop Name Neiman Marcus Group Inc. sent a cease-and-desist letter to a South Carolina thrift shop connected with a women’s shelter, South Carolina’s State newspaper reported. The luxury-goods retailer objects to the shop’s name -- “ Revente’s Last Call ” -- which the Dallas-based company claims could be confused with its “Last Call” clearance store, according to the State. Ginger Reeder, a Neiman Marcus spokeswoman, said the company wasn’t trying to shut down the thrift shop and seeks an amicable resolution to protect its trademark, the newspaper reported. State Representative James Smith , who is also an attorney, is representing the thrift shop pro bono and told the State that he was hopeful the parties could come to agreement and the shop could keep its name. Yahoo Removes Trademark Symbol From Company Logo Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , the Internet media company, has taken the trademark symbol off its logo, the TechCrunch technology news website reported. Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer used Twitter Inc.’s service to send out a message saying one of the company’s new employees had “gone on a mission” to remove all the trademark symbols from Yahoo’s campus, according to TechCrunch. She said that the Sunnyvale, California-based company’s use of the symbol had “bugged” the new employee, and that its removal wasn’t viewed with alarm by Yahoo’s legal staff, TechCrunch reported. “Legal assures us our trademark is implied and quite secure,” Mayer said, according to TechCrunch. Jetstar Opposes Toyota’s Jumping ‘Oh, What a Feeling!’ Trademark Jetstar Airways Pty Ltd., a low-cost airline based in Sunshine, Australia, is opposing Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s application to register “Oh, What a Feeling!” in connection with jumping actors as a trademark, the eTravel Blackboard website reported. Jetstar has used jumping actors since 2004, while Toyota has had ads with actors leaping since the mid-1980s, the website reported. Toyota spokesman Glenn Campbell said the company filed its application to register the mark earlier this year, according to eTravel Blackboard. Jetstar said its use of a jump in ads is an iconic symbol of the company and has been used in a number of Asian countries in addition to Australia and New Zealand, the website reported.

Copyright Pirate Party Member Uses DMCA to Halt Unauthorized Book Copies A member of the German branch of the anti-copyright Pirate Party , whose book “Click Me” is being published by a unit of Verlagsgruppe Random House GmbH, is enforcing her copyright in cyberspace, Spiegel Online reported. Julia Schramm , who has called the idea of intellectual property “disgusting” and received a 100,000-euro ($131,000) advance for the work, had a Sept. 17 release date for the book, according to Spiegel Online. Initially, unauthorized copies of the book were circulating on the Internet, with the link to the site from which it could be downloaded spread through social media, Spiegel Online reported. By the end of the day Sept. 17, visitors who followed the link were met with a notice that the file was no longer available because of a takedown request made by the author under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Spiegel Online reported. Copyright Costs Meant No Art Images in Art History Textbook First-year students at OCAD University , a Toronto-based school focused on art and design education, are paying C$180 ($185) for a required art history book that contains no illustrations because of copyright issues, Canada’s National Post reported. The book, “Global Visual and Cultural Material Culture: Prehistory to 1800,” contains blank spaces where illustrations normally would appear, according to the National Post. The dean of the school’s Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences said that the choice not to include images in the custom-made textbook was economic, because the fees to reproduce the images would have doubled the cost, the National Post reported. A comparable text for the next term, covering post-1800 art, will also cost C$180 and lack artwork, the dean said, according to the National Post. For more copyright news, click here.

J.C.

Penney Co. Chief Executive Officer Ron Johnson said its new shops are doing better than the rest of the store as the retailer turns locations into a collection of branded boutiques. J.C. Penney will eventually have 100 shops in stores and change 25 of them every year, Johnson said today during an investor presentation. He said the Plano, Texas-based retailer will compete with the “fast fashion” of Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) and Century 21. Johnson, Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s former retail chief, compared the new layouts to iPhone applications and said several designers are interested in having shops. Implementing the new layout is central to Johnson’s plan to turn around the fourth-largest U.S. department store company, which saw sales slide 20 percent in the first quarter. It is “way too early to draw conclusions” about the new layout, Johnson said, adding that women’s shops are “off the charts.” J.C. Penney rose 0.1 percent to $29.09 at the close in New York. The shares have dropped 17 percent this year. “I like the story, but you are talking 2014 before the concept is in place enough for it to really figure,” Noel Hebert, chief investment officer of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania- based Concannon Wealth Management LLC, said today in an e-mail. “Right now, your store-within-a-store brands/boutiques are doing well, but are not large enough to move the needle.''

HTC Unveils New Models With Windows 8 Software,['Dina Bass' 'Sarah Frier'],2012-09-19 18:07:41,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/htc-unveils-new-models-with-windows-8-software.html,"HTC Corp. (2498) , a Taiwanese smartphone maker, unveiled two models running Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows Phone 8, as HTC works to claw back handset market share lost to rivals and Microsoft expands the software’s reach. The Windows Phone 8X and 8S sport a new design, better audio and a wide-angle camera, HTC said today in a statement. They will debut in November, said Jason Mackenzie, HTC president of global sales and marketing, and AT&T Inc., Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile USA Inc. will sell them in the U.S. Microsoft, seeking a comeback for its mobile-phone business, is aiming to offer a wider selection of phones for the holiday season. The HTC rollout builds on the introduction of Windows 8 phones earlier this month by Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , a close Microsoft partner. HTC’s phones show the Taiwanese company’s strength in hardware and are sleeker than Nokia’s devices, according to research firm CCS Insight. “Pairing HTC’s beautiful new Windows Phone 8X and 8S with our brand is a big milestone for both companies,” Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said today in the statement. The 8X has a 4.3-inch screen and an 8-megapixel camera, and will be able to use the fastest wireless networks in the U.S., called long-term evolution. The 8S has a 4-inch screen. Both phones come in bright shades like red and blue and include Beats audio technology from Dr. Dre’s Beats Electronics LLC , in which HTC has a stake of about 25 percent. Smartphone Share In the global smartphone market, HTC has lost share to iPhone maker Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., which unveiled its own Windows Phone 8 handset in August. Even among Windows Phone sellers, HTC, one of Microsoft’s first partners for the revamped Windows Phone, has been surpassed in sales by Nokia, which struck a five-year deal with Microsoft.

Apple IPhone 5 Gets Glowing Reviews,['Adam Satariano'],2012-09-19 11:52:02,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/apple-iphone-5-gets-glowing-reviews.html,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone 5 drew accolades from technology-gadget critics, who praised the smartphone’s lightweight body design, bigger screen and swifter data-download speeds even as some faulted its mapping tools. The iPhone 5, which is scheduled to reach stores Sept. 21, is the best smartphone on the market, map-software flaws aside, according to Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal. Ed Baig of USA Today said the device keeps Apple ahead of rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , and Rich Jaroslovsky of Bloomberg called it the “handsomest phone you can buy.” The mostly positive reviews stand to fuel what’s already turning out to be robust demand for Apple’s best-selling product. The company said on Sept. 17 that it received more than 2 million orders in 24 hours, more than double the record set when the company introduced the iPhone 4S last year. “Nearly every feature has been upgraded, with a focus on what counts: screen, sound, camera, speed,” David Pogue  wrote in the New York Times. According to Mossberg and Jaroslovsky, one of the iPhone’s biggest drawbacks is the mapping software created by Apple to replace the Google Inc. (GOOG) maps application that had come pre- installed on the iPhone since 2007. For instance, Apple’s version doesn’t have public-transit routing, Mossberg said. Jaroslovsky said the software was easily confused giving directions, especially in urban areas. Both praised the device more generally. “Apple has taken an already great product and made it better,” Mossberg wrote. Eye Jab The iPhone will be available Sept. 21 in the U.S., Australia, Canada , France, Germany, Hong Kong , Japan, Singapore and the U.K. With a new wireless contract, the device costs $199, $299 and $399, depending on the amount of memory. Pogue criticized Apple’s change to a new dock connector, saying the move hampered the device’s compatibility with cars, clocks and speakers. The adapters being sold by Apple, which cost $30 or $40, don’t work for all accessories, he said. With the change, Apple gave away a competitive advantage of having a network of accessories available to use, Pogue said. “That’s not just a slap in the face to loyal customers -- it’s a jab in the eye,” Pogue said. One of the biggest improvements for the iPhone is its speed, said Baig of USA Today. The iPhone 5 connects to new high-speed wireless networks known as LTE, or long-term evolution, that are being introduced by companies such as AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Wireless , letting users more seamlessly watch video or toggle between Web pages or applications. ‘A Gem’ “People have always had lofty expectations for the iPhone 5, especially as the competition stiffens,” Baig wrote. “In delivering a fast, attractive, LTE-capable and larger-screen handset, Apple has met those expectations with a gem.” Bloomberg’s Jaroslovsky praised the device’s battery life, which for other smartphones drains more quickly when working on an LTE network. Apple, based in Cupertino, California , may sell 6 million to 10 million iPhones during the opening weekend, according to Gene Munster , an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. (PJC) With the iPhone 5 going on sale in 22 more countries on Sept. 28, Apple may sell another 49 million from October to December, according to Munster. The iPhone accounts for about two-thirds of Apple’s profit, helping make it the world’s most valuable company. Shares rose less than 1 percent to a record $701.91 yesterday. Because Apple only releases one new model a year, a successful debut is critical for the company’s continued growth. That compares with the several smartphones released each year by Samsung, Apple’s main competitor in a global smartphone market that surged 62 percent to $219.1 billion last year, according data compiled by Bloomberg Industries. Samsung, which makes smartphones with bigger screens than the new iPhone 5, has sold more than 20 million units of its Galaxy S III smartphone. “The iPhone 5 is by no means perfect, and we’re lucky there are a lot of really good smartphones on the market,” Jaroslovsky said. “But only one great one.” To contact the reporter on this story: Adam Satariano in San Francisco at  asatariano1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net",['Adam Satariano'],"Apple IPhone 5 Gets Glowing Reviews Apple Inc.

Facebook Gains on Mobile Ads for Other Apps: San Francisco Mover,['Brian Womack'],2012-09-19 19:43:04,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/facebook-tests-mobile-advertising-on-third-party-applications.html,"Facebook Inc. (FB) rose to the highest price in seven weeks after saying it is testing a service to place advertisements on mobile applications other than its own. The shares of Menlo Park , California-based Facebook advanced 6.5 percent to $23.29 at the close in New York , the highest since July 27. That helped pare the stock’s losses to 39 percent from the initial public offering in May. By placing ads on third-party applications, Facebook follows competitors, including Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) , in acting as a so-called ad network. The strategy would let it collect part of the revenue generated from mobile marketing and benefit from rising demand for ads that reach the growing number of people who download apps onto mobile devices. “We view the reported launch of a mobile ad network as another signal that Facebook is moving aggressively to improve user monetization,” said Colin Sebastian , an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., in a research report. “Facebook has the potential to become a more relevant ad network than Yahoo! and AOL, and to compete more directly with Google.” Facebook, owner of the most popular social network, is under pressure from investors to do a better job wringing sales from mobile services. The company may claim only 2.8 percent of the $2.61 billion U.S. mobile-ad market this year, ranking it sixth, behind No. 1 Google, which is expected to have 55 percent of the market, according to EMarketer Inc. Pandora Media Inc. (P) is second, with 8.7 percent, and Twitter Inc. nabs the No. 3 spot, claiming 5 percent.

Chanos Sees No Shortage of Overpriced Stocks in U.S. Bull Market,['Rita Nazareth'],2012-09-19 04:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/chanos-sees-no-shortage-of-overpriced-stocks-in-u-s-bull-market.html,"Jim Chanos , who oversees about $6 billion as the founder and president at Kynikos Associates Ltd., is finding companies to bet against as the U.S. stock market heads for the biggest rally in three years. The 54-year-old money manager who rose to fame shorting Enron Corp. before its collapse predicts declines in companies that may be inexpensive compared with earnings. Even as the U.S. economy recovers and profits approach record highs, Chanos is finding so-called value traps in natural gas companies, iron-ore producers, Hewlett-Packard Co. and Coinstar Inc. “A number of high-profile natural gas companies may end up in financial difficulty as early as next year,” he said, declining to give any company names. For Hewlett Packard, “It’s very difficult in the technology space when you have been leapfrogged to prosper again,” he said during a Sept. 11 interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. With the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index trading 11 percent below its average valuation since the 1950s, Chanos is trying to identify companies that are likely to fall even as the economy improves. He declined to provide performance data for his funds. The S&P 500 (SPX) has rallied 16 percent in 2012 and is poised for the biggest annual gain since 2009. Gross domestic product in the U.S. is forecast to increase 2.2 percent this year while earnings in the S&P 500 may reach $103.53 a share, the most ever, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. ‘Better Shape’ “Our economy and our banking system are in better shape than others,” Chanos said. “The surprises will probably be on the positive side in the U.S. market. I don’t think that necessarily helps someone like a Coinstar or Hewlett-Packard.” The S&P 500 Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Index, which includes companies such as Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) and Devon Energy Corp., has risen 5 percent this year, about a third of the advance in the S&P 500. Since 2009, its price-earnings ratio has shrunk to 12.9 from 54. Shares of Chesapeake, the second-largest U.S. gas producer, have lost 37 percent in the past year as a slump in gas prices squeezed cash flow and forced Chief Executive Officer Aubrey McClendon to accelerate asset sales. The stock was battered amid two federal probes of potential conflicts between the CEO’s personal financial transactions and corporate duties. Job Cuts Exco Resources Inc. (XCO) wrote down the value of its gas fields by $429 million in July amid dwindling prices for the fuel. The company’s output is 98 percent natural gas, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and its shares have fallen 30 percent this year. Michael Kehs, a Chesapeake spokesman, declined to comment. Douglas H. Miller, Exco’s chairman, and Stephen F. Smith, the company’s president, did not return calls seeking for comment. Natural gas prices in New York trading have averaged $2.57 per million Btu this year, the lowest since 1999. Prices reached a record high of $15.78 per million Btu in December 2005. “These companies have enormous cash needs,” Chanos said, who tries to profit by selling borrowed shares and replacing them after they fall. “One intriguing trade might be to be long natural gas and short some of the leveraged natural-gas companies.” PC Earnings Earnings for personal-computer makers are being hurt by consumers and businesses favoring tablets such as Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad. Hewlett-Packard, which reported a record loss on Aug. 23, has posted four quarters of declining sales on weaker demand. Shares of the Palo Alto , California-based company have tumbled 29 percent this year. HP (HPQ) trades at a forward price-to- earnings ratio of 4.3, down from 10.45 in 2009. The company is a “value trap,” according to Chanos, who’s shorting the stock. “Hewlett-Packard finds itself in that difficult position today, having to make pricey and risky acquisitions, just to stop itself from shrinking,” he said. Former Chief Executive Officer Mark Hurd pushed into enterprise services with the $13.2 billion purchase of Electronic Data Systems Corp. in 2008. The company said last month that it would write down the value of its enterprise- services business by $8 billion. “HP is better aligning our cost structure with our revenue profile to invest in innovation and quality, and ultimately deliver better returns to shareholders,” HP’s spokesman Michael Thacker wrote in an e-mail.  Coinstar Inc., operator of the Redbox movie-rental kiosks, is also among Chanos’s bearish bets as he says its business is reaching a saturation point. Missing Estimates Coinstar shares have tumbled 28 percent from this year’s high on July 5. The owner of the Redbox movie-rental kiosks reported second-quarter revenue growth that missed analysts’ estimates and said last month that Gregg Kaplan, the company’s president and interim chief of the Redbox DVD rental unit, plans to leave in March. “Coinstar Inc. (CSTR) management is optimistic about the future of its businesses and ongoing growth opportunities,” Marci Maule, a Coinstar spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail. “We do not comment on the views or opinions of investors.” Bets related to China in Kynikos’s global short fund make up about 20 percent of its roughly 100 positions, he said. China’s economy grew 7.6 percent in the second quarter, the slowest pace in three years, as Europe ’s debt crisis limited exports and property curbs damped domestic demand. ‘Very Good’ “China has been a very good place to be short stocks for the past three years,” he said. “People are increasingly taking a closer look at the Chinese banking system. The questions being asked are getting more granular.” Australian iron-ore producer Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) is also among Chanos’s shorts. He said industry capacity is going to expand globally even as demand stalls because of China’s slowdown. Iron-ore prices have fallen 29 percent this year through Sept. 12, trading at $98.1 a metric ton, according to The Steel Index Ltd. Yvonne Ball, a spokeswoman for Fortescue, didn’t respond to an e-mail or phone call seeking for comment. “As much as I like the story on the short side, there’s lots of things to do globally and we don’t want to be just short China,” Chanos said.

The 54-year-old money manager who rose to fame shorting Enron Corp. before its collapse predicts declines in companies that may be inexpensive compared with earnings. Even as the U.S. economy recovers and profits approach record highs, Chanos is finding so-called value traps in natural gas companies, iron-ore producers, Hewlett-Packard Co. and Coinstar Inc. “A number of high-profile natural gas companies may end up in financial difficulty as early as next year,” he said, declining to give any company names. For Hewlett Packard, “It’s very difficult in the technology space when you have been leapfrogged to prosper again,” he said during a Sept. 11 interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. With the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index trading 11 percent below its average valuation since the 1950s, Chanos is trying to identify companies that are likely to fall even as the economy improves. He declined to provide performance data for his funds. The S&P 500 (SPX) has rallied 16 percent in 2012 and is poised for the biggest annual gain since 2009. Gross domestic product in the U.S. is forecast to increase 2.2 percent this year while earnings in the S&P 500 may reach $103.53 a share, the most ever, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. ‘Better Shape’ “Our economy and our banking system are in better shape than others,” Chanos said. “The surprises will probably be on the positive side in the U.S. market. I don’t think that necessarily helps someone like a Coinstar or Hewlett-Packard.” The S&P 500 Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Index, which includes companies such as Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) and Devon Energy Corp., has risen 5 percent this year, about a third of the advance in the S&P 500. Since 2009, its price-earnings ratio has shrunk to 12.9 from 54. Shares of Chesapeake, the second-largest U.S. gas producer, have lost 37 percent in the past year as a slump in gas prices squeezed cash flow and forced Chief Executive Officer Aubrey McClendon to accelerate asset sales. The stock was battered amid two federal probes of potential conflicts between the CEO’s personal financial transactions and corporate duties. Job Cuts Exco Resources Inc. (XCO) wrote down the value of its gas fields by $429 million in July amid dwindling prices for the fuel. The company’s output is 98 percent natural gas, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and its shares have fallen 30 percent this year. Michael Kehs, a Chesapeake spokesman, declined to comment. Douglas H. Miller, Exco’s chairman, and Stephen F. Smith, the company’s president, did not return calls seeking for comment. Natural gas prices in New York trading have averaged $2.57 per million Btu this year, the lowest since 1999. Prices reached a record high of $15.78 per million Btu in December 2005. “These companies have enormous cash needs,” Chanos said, who tries to profit by selling borrowed shares and replacing them after they fall. “One intriguing trade might be to be long natural gas and short some of the leveraged natural-gas companies.” PC Earnings Earnings for personal-computer makers are being hurt by consumers and businesses favoring tablets such as Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad. Hewlett-Packard, which reported a record loss on Aug. 23, has posted four quarters of declining sales on weaker demand. Shares of the Palo Alto , California-based company have tumbled 29 percent this year. HP (HPQ) trades at a forward price-to- earnings ratio of 4.3, down from 10.45 in 2009.

Celestica rose 6.3 percent to C$10.40 at the end of trading in Toronto after increasing as much as 9.4 percent, its biggest one-day gain in 15 months. The Toronto-based company reported earnings of 21 cents a share, beating the 17-cent average of 13 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue was $1.5 billion, beating the estimate of $1.44 billion. “The revenue upside was driven in large part by the communications segment,” said Thanos Moschopoulos, an analyst at Bank of Montreal, in a note to investors. “Management noted that it saw strong demand from several customers kick-in toward the end of the quarter.” Celestica forecast adjusted earnings of 17 cents to 23 cents a share for the third quarter, according to the statement today. “Despite the challenging economic environment, we are projecting continued growth,” the company said in the statement. The former maker of smartphones for Waterloo-based BlackBerry Ltd. (BB) has shifted its focus to contracts in the so-called diversified category, which includes defense, industrial and semiconducter customers.

Apple Developer Website Back Online After Hacker Attack,['Jordan Robertson'],2013-07-27 00:59:31,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/apple-developer-website-back-online-after-hacker-attack.html,"Apple Inc.

Apple took the site, used by engineers who write applications for iPhones, Macs and other products, offline on July 18 after a hacker tried to steal basic information, the Cupertino, California-based company said. The site was active as of 5 p.m. local time. Developers use the site for software downloads, documentation and engineering information. The maker of iPhones and iPads said this week that it’s “completely overhauling” its developer systems to prevent a security threat from happening again. While some of the website’s information was encrypted, Apple said it hadn’t been able to rule out whether names, mailing addresses or e-mail addresses may have been accessed.

SEC Fraud Probes Said to Suffer If E-Mails Kept Private,['Todd Shields' 'Joshua Gallu'],2013-07-26 04:00:01,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/sec-fraud-probes-said-to-suffer-if-e-mails-kept-private.html,"There’s a tie that binds the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s separate probes of SAC Capital Advisors LP founder Steven A. Cohen and Fabrice Tourre, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. vice president. It’s old e-mails, which feature prominently as evidence in SEC enforcement actions. How the agency obtains e-mails has become the subject of a Washington debate, pitting Wall Street’s top regulator against privacy advocates and Internet companies, which say the information they store should be as secure from government seizure as documents in a desk drawer. The SEC is fighting legislation that would trim government access to personal and corporate e-mail kept for customers by third-party providers, such as Amazon.com Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  Bipartisan legislation requiring agencies to get warrants to access e-mails could have “a significant negative impact” on enforcement efforts, SEC Chairman Mary Jo White said in an April letter to Congress. The SEC, a civil regulatory agency, doesn’t have authority to obtain warrants. “I think there’s critical mass to get this legislation through,” Kevin Richards, senior vice president for federal government affairs at TechAmerica, a Washington-based trade group with members including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , Hewlett-Packard Co. and International Business Machines Corp., said in an interview. ‘Silly E-Mail’ The SEC has “often” asked Internet service providers for e-mails “because persons who violate the law frequently do not retain copies of incriminating communications,” White said in her letter to Senator Patrick Leahy , the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a sponsor of the bill. The legislation awaits a vote by the full Senate; a similar bill is being considered in the House. SEC spokesman Kevin Callahan declined to comment on whether the agency used this method to obtain emails used in the SAC Capital or Tourre cases. E-mails have taken starring roles in both cases. In Tourre’s trial yesterday, SEC attorneys asked him about one 2007 e-mail in which he dubbed himself “the fabulous Fab” who forged “complex, highly levered, exotic trades.” “This is a silly, romantic e-mail I sent late at night at a moment of market stress,” Tourre said. When it accused Cohen last week of failing to prevent insider trading , the SEC cited a 2008 e-mail he received as a supposed warning sign that his employees may be making illegal trades. Cohen’s lawyers said he never read the e-mail. Harm Investigations Reduced access to e-mails could harm some investigations, Steve Crimmins, a former SEC trial attorney who is now a partner at law firm K&L Gates LLP in Washington , said in an interview. “In dealing with large corporations which have responsibly maintained e-mail communications, the SEC will be able to get all the e-mail it needs,” Crimmins said. “But in cases with less responsible entities or investigations just involving individuals, the SEC will be severely hampered in getting the evidence it needs to bring a case.” The SEC has authority to issue administrative subpoenas, which require the recipient to hand over all relevant documents. However, many SEC probes are covert, so investigators subpoena information from third parties, such as trading records from a brokerage or e-mails from a third-party Internet service provider , without tipping off the subject. 1986 Law The Senate measure would update a 1986 law by extending its warrant requirement for recent e-mails to those older than 180 days, which weren’t shielded when the statute was written. “The bill as currently constituted could have a significant negative impact” on enforcement efforts, White said. She proposed allowing access to communications from Internet service providers if agencies first meet a judicial standard comparable to the one for criminal warrants. White’s proposal is opposed by companies, including the biggest U.S. Web portal Yahoo, online storage provider Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , electronic market hub EBay Inc. (EBAY) , personal-finance software provider Intuit Inc. (INTU) , and search-engine leader Google Inc. (GOOG) , in addition to groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Library Association. They said in a July 12 letter to Congress that the SEC sought a “sweeping change” that would allow other agencies conducting civil investigations, such as the Internal Revenue Service and the Environmental Protection Agency, to get e-mail without warrants. “It will no doubt be dubbed ‘the IRS exception’ because it would give all federal agencies including the Internal Revenue Service access to e-mail and internal communications without a warrant,” Gregory Nojeim, senior counsel at the Washington-based Center for Democracy & Technology, a policy group that works for Internet freedom, said in an interview. Changing Technology The original act was passed 27 years ago, when e-mail was a novelty and “no one could have imagined the way the Internet and mobile technologies would transform how we communicate,” Leahy told colleagues March 19 as he introduced the bill. Companies face a welter of requests from local courts and sheriffs, federal agencies and county governments, and have a “broad consensus” that the law needs to be updated, Ed Black , president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, a Washington-based trade group with members including Google, Yahoo, Facebook Inc. (FB) and Microsoft Corp., said in an interview. Disquiet over domestic intelligence-gathering revealed by fugitive Edward Snowden, a former security contractor for Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp., has spurred lawmakers to debate controls on government access to private information, improving odds Congress will pass the bill, Nojeim said. The Senate bill is co-sponsored by Senator Mike Lee , a Utah Republican. Similar legislation in the House, introduced by Representative Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican, has attracted 136 co-sponsors. Expanding Business The business of storing information remotely, in the so-called cloud, was worth an estimated $110.3 billion in 2012 and could expand to $210 billion by this year, according to Gartner Inc., a technology researcher based in Stamford , Connecticut. Growth in the sector where leaders include Google, Apple Inc., Microsoft and Amazon could slow if businesses are concerned their information isn’t secure, according to a June 13 report by Bloomberg Government analysts Michael Nelson and Allan Holmes. “Companies have -- and our customers want us to have -- a duty and the legal ability to protect their privacy,” Black said.

Apple IPhone Share Shrinks as China’s Huawei to ZTE Lure Users,['Bloomberg News'],2013-07-26 05:35:41,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/apple-iphone-share-shrinks-as-china-s-huawei-to-zte-lure-users.html,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s share of the global smartphone market fell to its lowest in three years in the second quarter as more consumers chose inexpensive handsets from Chinese makers over the iPhone. Apple shipped 31.2 million devices for 13.6 percent of the global smartphone market, researcher Strategy Analytics reported yesterday. That’s down from a 16.6 percent share a year earlier and trails market leader Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) ’s 76 million shipments and 33.1 percent market share, Boston , Massachusetts-based Strategy Analytics said. The Cupertino, California-based smartphone maker lost share to Chinese makers Huawei Technologies Co and ZTE Corp. (763) , according to the report. Apple’s 20 percent increase during the quarter was less than half the smartphone industry’s 47 percent expansion pace, according to the report. “Lower-priced smartphones continue to gain traction, but the key for vendors will be to keep prices low while still offering premium devices and services,” Ramon Llamas , research manager at International Data Corp. said in a separate report yesterday. Apple posted its second-lowest year-over-year iPhone growth rate in almost four years as some buyers held off on purchases in advance of an expected next-generation device this fall, IDC said. Apple’s global smartphone market share of 13.6 percent in the quarter was its lowest level since the second quarter of 2010, according to the estimates by Strategy Analytics. LG Electronics “The current iPhone portfolio is under-performing and Apple is at risk of being trapped in a pincer movement between rival 3-inch Android models at the low-end and 5-inch Android models at the high-end,” Neil Mawston, executive director at Strategy Analytics, wrote in the report. Apple is also losing share to LG Electronics Inc. (066570) of South Korea, according to both IDC and Strategy Analytics. “LG was a star performer as global shipments doubled year-over-year,” Linda Sui, analyst at Strategy Analytics, said in the report. “If LG can expand its retail presence and marketing in major countries such as the U.S. or China , LG could quietly start to challenge Apple for second position.” The top five global smartphone vendors in the second quarter by IDC’s ranking are: Samsung with 30.4 percent; Apple with 13.1 percent; LG with 5.1 percent; Lenovo with 4.7 percent and ZTE with 4.2 percent. The ranking from Strategy Analytics shows Samsung at 33.1 percent; Apple with 13.6 percent; LG with 5.3 percent; ZTE with 5 percent and Huawei with 4.8 percent.

Apple’s 20 percent increase during the quarter was less than half the smartphone industry’s 47 percent expansion pace, according to the report. “Lower-priced smartphones continue to gain traction, but the key for vendors will be to keep prices low while still offering premium devices and services,” Ramon Llamas , research manager at International Data Corp. said in a separate report yesterday. Apple posted its second-lowest year-over-year iPhone growth rate in almost four years as some buyers held off on purchases in advance of an expected next-generation device this fall, IDC said. Apple’s global smartphone market share of 13.6 percent in the quarter was its lowest level since the second quarter of 2010, according to the estimates by Strategy Analytics. LG Electronics “The current iPhone portfolio is under-performing and Apple is at risk of being trapped in a pincer movement between rival 3-inch Android models at the low-end and 5-inch Android models at the high-end,” Neil Mawston, executive director at Strategy Analytics, wrote in the report. Apple is also losing share to LG Electronics Inc. (066570) of South Korea, according to both IDC and Strategy Analytics. “LG was a star performer as global shipments doubled year-over-year,” Linda Sui, analyst at Strategy Analytics, said in the report. “If LG can expand its retail presence and marketing in major countries such as the U.S. or China , LG could quietly start to challenge Apple for second position.” The top five global smartphone vendors in the second quarter by IDC’s ranking are: Samsung with 30.4 percent; Apple with 13.1 percent; LG with 5.1 percent; Lenovo with 4.7 percent and ZTE with 4.2 percent. The ranking from Strategy Analytics shows Samsung at 33.1 percent; Apple with 13.6 percent; LG with 5.3 percent; ZTE with 5 percent and Huawei with 4.8 percent.

Deutsche Bank Gets Boost From Underwriting as Profit Seen Rising,['Weixin Zha' 'Nicholas Comfort'],2013-07-26 09:54:57,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/deutsche-bank-gets-boost-from-underwriting-as-profit-seen-rising.html,"Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , continental Europe’s biggest lender, may say second-quarter profit climbed after earnings from underwriting stock and bond sales helped bring a surge in investment banking revenue. Net income may increase 29 percent to 845 million euros ($1.12 billion) in the three months through June from 656 million euros a year earlier, according to the average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Deutsche Bank may say pretax profit at the investment bank doubled to 990 million euros when it reports the earnings on July 30. Global investment banks, including Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc., had higher revenue from trading and underwriting securities for clients in the second quarter. Deutsche Bank Co-Chief Executive Officer Anshu Jain, 50, is also cutting pay, shedding riskier assets and moving staff to cheaper locations to reduce costs. “The market is expecting to see a good quarter in investment banking,” Ingo Frommen, an analyst with Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg in Stuttgart who recommends investors buy the stock, said in a telephone interview yesterday. “There is positive momentum on costs, but I don’t know if we’ll see the full effect as they still have to spend money on their overhaul and then there’s the black box of litigation.” Apple Bonds Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs were among banks earning $53.25 million in fees from underwriting a $17 billion bond sale by Apple Inc. (AAPL) Deutsche Bank was joint global coordinator with Morgan Stanley on the sale of 1.4 billion euros of shares in broadcaster RTL Group SA (RTL) by Bertelsmann SE, Europe’s largest media company, at the end of April. Jain, formerly head of the investment bank, has set aside 2.4 billion euros to cover expenses from litigation and regulatory probes including an investigation into alleged manipulation of Libor, a global benchmark for interest rates. Net income at Deutsche Bank rose 19 percent to 1.65 billion euros in the first quarter, traditionally a peak period for investment banking as clients do new business at the start of the year. Deutsche Bank rose 0.5 percent to 36.22 euros a 11:06 a.m. in Frankfurt , valuing the company at 36.9 billion euros. The shares have risen 9.9 percent this year compared with a 9.4 percent increase for the 40-member Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index. Revenue was “sound” in the first two months of the second quarter, helped by “solid” income at the investment bank, Jain said in June. Low interest rates and pressure on margins in some regions and businesses put a drag on earnings, he told investors at a conference in New York. Transaction Banking Revenue from fixed income, currencies and commodities was 9.2 billion euros last year, 59 percent of the 15.6 billion euros in income at the investment bank unit, according to company filings. The investment bank contributed 46 percent of the firm’s 33.7 billion euros of revenue. Deutsche Bank’s three non-investment banking businesses also helped earnings grow, the survey showed. Pretax profit at the transaction banking division probably rose 9.1 percent to 321 million euros, according to the average estimate of seven analysts. Asset and wealth management saw a 49 percent increase to 146 million euros and private and corporate banking raised pretax profit 9.5 percent to 402 million euros, the analysts said. Lower Expenses Cost-cutting is also helping boost profit. In September, Deutsche Bank announced a plan to reduce annual expenses by 4.5 billion euros by 2015. It completed the majority of almost 2,000 job cuts, including more than 800 at the investment-banking unit, by the end of last year. The company started moving 1,500 positions out of New York, London , Hong Kong and Singapore in the first quarter, Chief Operating Officer Henry Ritchotte said in a presentation to investors in Brussels last month. The bank hasn’t specified where the jobs are being moved to. Jain and Chief Financial Officer Stefan Krause are scheduled to hold a conference call with analysts at 8 a.m. Frankfurt time after the publication of the quarterly results. Investors will probably ask Jain about plans to reduce leverage at the bank toward levels recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, said Andreas Plaesier , an analyst at M.M. Warburg in Hamburg who recommends investors buy Deutsche Bank shares. Leverage Concern Some regulators are questioning the weightings banks use to determine their risk and capital levels and are instead embracing a broader measure of equity to total assets known as the leverage ratio. The Basel committee, which sets global banking standards, has suggested that banks hold capital equivalent to 3 percent or more of their assets. Deutsche Bank had a leverage ratio of 2 percent after selling almost 3 billion euros of shares at the end of April, James Chappell, an analyst at Berenberg Bank in London, said in an e-mailed report to clients last month. The company would have to delay dividends and set aside four years of profit to exceed the 3 percent goal, according to Berenberg.

Facebook’s Mobile-Ad Boom Provides Model to Social Sites,['Douglas Mac Millan' 'Callie Bost'],2013-07-26 20:08:16,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/facebook-s-mobile-ad-boom-provides-model-to-social-sites.html,"Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s success in mobile advertising, which is making it a stronger rival to Google Inc. (GOOG) , is also providing a model for other social-networking sites such as Twitter Inc., Pinterest Inc. and Snapchat Inc. Facebook’s mobile ads generated 41 percent of revenue last quarter, up from 14 percent a year earlier, helping the company top second-quarter profit and sales estimates this week. The results contrasted with earnings from Google and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , which both reported lower-than-predicted revenue. As companies cope with a shift to wireless devices, Facebook is benefiting from a user base that checks in several times a day and is willing to accept marketing messages in news feeds. Twitter is already seeing ads surge with a similar approach and others such as Snapchat may not be far behind, said Laura O’Shaughnessy, chief executive officer of SocialCode. “You will see mobile ad dollars booming as usage heads in that direction,” said O’Shaughnessy, whose company helps advertisers buy on social and mobile networks. “ Facebook made huge changes to its news feed ads that made them much more effective, and that’s why there’s more spend there.” While Google accounts for more than 50 percent of the world’s mobile-ad market, it’s now growing more slowly than Facebook. Internet-search ads -- Google’s biggest strength --are less effective on mobile screens than on desktop computers, said Scott Kessler, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ in New York. Lower Pricing “It’s harder to read,” Kessler said. “People are less likely to click on it, and there’s lower pricing in a mobile environment.” Rob Shilkin, a spokesman for Mountain View, California-based Google, declined to comment. Twitter, which lets users share 140-character status updates, also sells ads that appear inside mobile news feeds. Those ads account for more than half of the company’s revenue on some days, CEO Dick Costolo has said. Pinterest, a site for collecting and sharing images, and Snapchat, a mobile messaging service, haven’t yet introduced mobile ads. Still, they’re now better poised to do so in the wake of Facebook’s success, O’Shaughnessy said. Banner advertising, meanwhile, can be less relevant because it doesn’t typically target users based on their interests or habits, Kessler said. Google’s AdMob unit and Apple Inc.’s iAd service both focus on those kinds of promotions, which often appear at the top or bottom of a device’s screen. Bar Bets Facebook’s mobile application has gained support from advertisers because it more closely ties ads to the activities of its 819 million users, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. Facebook, the world’s largest social-networking site, has 1.15 billion members in total -- including people who just use it on desktop computers. “The existence of a Facebook app on your phone makes you more likely to check on it day in and day out,” Pachter said. “Google is great in satisfying bar bets. I’m not sure if it’s as good in Internet ad revenue as Facebook.” Facebook hones its ad messages by looking at what has worked in the past with a user’s friends, said George Bell, CEO of the mobile-ad company Jumptap Inc. That helps generate more clicks and purchases. Facebook further refines its targeting by using data from outside marketing firms such as Acxiom Corp. (ACXM) and Epsilon Corp. (EPSO) , he said. “They’re on the path to take the social signals conveyed through actions on Facebook and supplement those with insights from third parties to paint a richer picture,” Bell said. ‘Paying Off’ By showing progress in mobile advertising, Facebook’s quarterly results sent its shares up almost 30 percent to $34.36 yesterday for a record one-day gain. That brought the stock within a few dollars of its May 2012 initial public offering price. The shares slipped 1 percent to $34.01 today in New York. “We’re effectively navigating the shift to mobile,” David Ebersman , chief financial officer of Menlo Park, California-based Facebook , said in an interview. “All the investments we’ve been making in the business have been paying off.” Unlike Google and Apple, which built out their mobile-ad businesses by acquiring startups, Facebook has relied mostly on internal development for this piece of its intellectual property. That may have helped it better customize mobile ads to its service, said Lars Albright, who co-founded Quattro Wireless Inc. -- a company sold to Apple in 2010. That startup became the basis for iAd. “They are building this all in-house,” said Albright, who now runs mobile startup SessionM. “They feel that particularly the targeting piece is so core to their IP and who they are that they felt best-suited to do it.” Seeking Scale The challenge for smaller social-networking companies is building enough scale to do what Facebook is doing, said Will Margiloff, CEO of IgnitionOne, a marketing-technology company that analyzes industry trends. For now, there aren’t many services with enough mobile users, he said. “Facebook’s strategy can’t be replicated elsewhere, except maybe Twitter,” Margiloff said. “The platform itself lends itself well to mobile as it already has so many mobile users.” Luis Caballero, chief operating officer of media-buying firm Blinq Media LLC, sees more advertisers shifting their budgets to Facebook. That’s coming at the expense of Google, he said. Marketers increased their mobile-advertising budgets for Facebook’s mobile app to about 24 percent last month from 10 percent in January, he estimates. “Advertisers are definitely going heavier on Facebook right now,” he said.

"S&P 500 Snaps 4-Week Gain Amid Earnings, Stimulus Concern",['Alex Barinka' 'Nikolaj Gammeltoft'],2013-07-26 22:02:40,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/s-p-500-snaps-4-week-gain-amid-earnings-stimulus-concern.html,"The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (VIX) snapped a four-week advance as investors weighed corporate earnings amid speculation that the Federal Reserve may reduce its asset purchases this year. Caterpillar Inc. fell 4.2 percent after quarterly profit missed estimates and it cut its annual earnings forecast. McDonald’s Corp. tumbled 2.2 percent after saying economic weakness would hurt results for the rest of the year. Homebuilders dropped 8.8 percent as a group as PulteGroup (PHM) Inc. and D.R. Horton Inc. lost more than 12 percent. Facebook Inc. (FB)  surged 31 percent as mobile advertising helped profit. The S&P 500 dropped less than 0.1 percent to 1,691.65, its first weekly decline since June 21. The benchmark index reached a record on July 22 and climbed within 3 points of 1,700 for three straight days before retreating. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) added 15.09 points, or 0.1 percent, to 15,558.83. “The market is trying to figure out where we have some safety and where we have top-line and bottom-line growth,” Samuel Lieber, the Purchase, New York-based chief executive officer at Alpine Woods Capital Investors, said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees $4.8 billion. “The underlying trend is being questioned.” The Fed has said economic data will determine the timing and pace of any reduction in its $85 billion in monthly asset purchases. A gauge of manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region unexpectedly fell, while orders for durable goods rose more than forecast in June and consumer confidence unexpectedly increased in July to the highest level in six years. Bull Market The S&P 500 (SPX) climbed 150 percent since March 2009 as the U.S. bull market has entered its fifth year, driven by better-than-estimated corporate earnings and three rounds of bond purchases by the U.S. central bank. The stock gauge is heading for a 5.3 percent advance this month, the most since October 2011. The gauge fell in June, after seven successive months of gains, as Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on May 21 the Fed could reduce its bond purchases as early as September. Equity valuations have climbed 16 percent this year, with the S&P 500 trading at 16.1 times reported operating earnings, close to the highest level since May 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, gained 1.4 percent to 12.72 during the week. The equity volatility gauge, which moves in the opposite direction as the S&P 500 about 80 percent of the time, is down 29 percent for the year. More Clues The coming week will offer more clues to the state of the economy. In addition to earnings reports will be data on U.S. gross domestic product and the monthly labor report, as well as monetary policy announcements by the Fed and the European Central Bank. “The Fed is going to be meeting and there is speculation that maybe they will start to reduce their bond purchases in September,” Peter Jankovskis , co-chief investment officer who helps manage $3.6 billion at Oakbrook Investments LLC, said via phone from Lisle, Illinois. “The reports that we have had and any statements they make are going to be the big lead-in to that story. The big driver really continues to be the employment statistics.” Exxon Mobil Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) will be among 134 S&P 500 companies releasing results in the coming week. Of the 260 companies in the benchmark equity index that have posted quarterly results so far, 73 percent have exceeded analysts’ estimates for profit and 57 percent have topped sales projections, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Industrials lost 1 percent as a group for the week, the most among 10 industries in the S&P 500, followed by a 0.8 percent drop among energy producers. Slower Demand Caterpillar (CAT) slid 4.2 percent to $82.06 for the steepest loss in the Dow. Earnings for the world’s largest maker of mining and construction machinery trailed analysts’ estimates for a third straight quarter and cut its forecast as mining-equipment sales declined on slower commodity demand from emerging markets. McDonald’s fell 2.2 percent, the second-most in the Dow, to $98.03. The world’s largest restaurant chain posted second-quarter profit and revenue that fell short of analysts’ forecasts and said sales for the rest of 2013 would be hurt by economic weakness. Expedia Inc. (EXPE) sank 27 percent to $47.20 for the biggest retreat in the S&P 500 as the online travel agency missed sales and profit estimates amid increased competition. Netflix Inc. slumped 6.9 percent to $246.31 on slower-than-estimated subscriber gains. Homebuilders Tumble An index of homebuilders fell 8.8 percent as PulteGroup and D.R. Horton reported lower-than-forecast orders, adding to concerns that higher mortgage rates will hamper the nation’s housing recovery. PulteGroup plunged 16 percent to $16.36 for its biggest weekly decline in almost two years. D.R. Horton sank 12 percent to $19.33. Health-care stocks and technology companies added at least 0.8 percent for the biggest gains of the week. Facebook jumped 31 percent, its biggest weekly advance, to $34.01. The operator of the world’s most popular social-networking service reported sales and profit that beat estimates. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg ’s decision last year to bet big on mobile software is paying off, with sales of ads on wireless devices now on track to surpass revenue from desktop computers. Apple Jumps Apple Inc. (AAPL) rose 3.8 percent to $440.99. The world’s most valuable technology company, which hasn’t refreshed its iPhone and iPad since last year, managed to exceed analysts’ earnings projections, even as profit declined from a year earlier and sales were largely flat. Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) soared 13 percent to $10.96. The second-biggest maker of heart-rhythm devices reported profit that beat analysts’ estimates and raised its forecast amid signs that demand for defibrillators and stents is starting to stabilize. Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) rose 6.6 percent to a record $73.36 after profits topped forecasts. Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz ’s push into food is starting to pay off, driving traffic into U.S. stores and lifting sales and profit.

Bull Market The S&P 500 (SPX) climbed 150 percent since March 2009 as the U.S. bull market has entered its fifth year, driven by better-than-estimated corporate earnings and three rounds of bond purchases by the U.S. central bank. The stock gauge is heading for a 5.3 percent advance this month, the most since October 2011. The gauge fell in June, after seven successive months of gains, as Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on May 21 the Fed could reduce its bond purchases as early as September. Equity valuations have climbed 16 percent this year, with the S&P 500 trading at 16.1 times reported operating earnings, close to the highest level since May 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, gained 1.4 percent to 12.72 during the week. The equity volatility gauge, which moves in the opposite direction as the S&P 500 about 80 percent of the time, is down 29 percent for the year. More Clues The coming week will offer more clues to the state of the economy. In addition to earnings reports will be data on U.S. gross domestic product and the monthly labor report, as well as monetary policy announcements by the Fed and the European Central Bank. “The Fed is going to be meeting and there is speculation that maybe they will start to reduce their bond purchases in September,” Peter Jankovskis , co-chief investment officer who helps manage $3.6 billion at Oakbrook Investments LLC, said via phone from Lisle, Illinois. “The reports that we have had and any statements they make are going to be the big lead-in to that story. The big driver really continues to be the employment statistics.” Exxon Mobil Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) will be among 134 S&P 500 companies releasing results in the coming week. Of the 260 companies in the benchmark equity index that have posted quarterly results so far, 73 percent have exceeded analysts’ estimates for profit and 57 percent have topped sales projections, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Industrials lost 1 percent as a group for the week, the most among 10 industries in the S&P 500, followed by a 0.8 percent drop among energy producers. Slower Demand Caterpillar (CAT) slid 4.2 percent to $82.06 for the steepest loss in the Dow. Earnings for the world’s largest maker of mining and construction machinery trailed analysts’ estimates for a third straight quarter and cut its forecast as mining-equipment sales declined on slower commodity demand from emerging markets. McDonald’s fell 2.2 percent, the second-most in the Dow, to $98.03. The world’s largest restaurant chain posted second-quarter profit and revenue that fell short of analysts’ forecasts and said sales for the rest of 2013 would be hurt by economic weakness. Expedia Inc. (EXPE) sank 27 percent to $47.20 for the biggest retreat in the S&P 500 as the online travel agency missed sales and profit estimates amid increased competition. Netflix Inc. slumped 6.9 percent to $246.31 on slower-than-estimated subscriber gains. Homebuilders Tumble An index of homebuilders fell 8.8 percent as PulteGroup and D.R. Horton reported lower-than-forecast orders, adding to concerns that higher mortgage rates will hamper the nation’s housing recovery. PulteGroup plunged 16 percent to $16.36 for its biggest weekly decline in almost two years. D.R. Horton sank 12 percent to $19.33. Health-care stocks and technology companies added at least 0.8 percent for the biggest gains of the week. Facebook jumped 31 percent, its biggest weekly advance, to $34.01. The operator of the world’s most popular social-networking service reported sales and profit that beat estimates. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg ’s decision last year to bet big on mobile software is paying off, with sales of ads on wireless devices now on track to surpass revenue from desktop computers. Apple Jumps Apple Inc. (AAPL) rose 3.8 percent to $440.99. The world’s most valuable technology company, which hasn’t refreshed its iPhone and iPad since last year, managed to exceed analysts’ earnings projections, even as profit declined from a year earlier and sales were largely flat. Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) soared 13 percent to $10.96. The second-biggest maker of heart-rhythm devices reported profit that beat analysts’ estimates and raised its forecast amid signs that demand for defibrillators and stents is starting to stabilize. Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) rose 6.6 percent to a record $73.36 after profits topped forecasts. Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz ’s push into food is starting to pay off, driving traffic into U.S. stores and lifting sales and profit.

U.S. Stocks Erase Gains Amid Meeting on Greece Aid,['Nikolaj Gammeltoft' 'Alexis Xydias'],2012-11-12 22:18:21,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/u-s-stock-futures-climb-as-apple-gains.html,"U.S. stocks erased gains, failing to rebound after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s biggest weekly retreat since June, as investors awaited budget talks in Washington and European finance chiefs met to discuss Greek aid. Jefferies Group Inc. jumped 14 percent after Leucadia National Corp. (LUK) said it will buy the investment bank. Titanium Metals Corp. (TIE) surged 43 percent after Precision Castparts (PCP) Corp. agreed to buy the maker of titanium products. An S&P index of homebuilders slid 4.1 percent as D.R. Horton Inc.’s chief executive officer cautioned that weak employment growth could hurt sales of new homes. Apple Inc. (AAPL)  slumped 0.8 percent after dropping for seven straight weeks. The S&P 500 rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,380 at 4 p.m. in New York, after gaining as much as 0.4 percent earlier in the trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.23 point, or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,815.16. Related links: “The last month has been very weak for the market,” Robert Stimpson, a money manager at Akron, Ohio-based Oak Associates Ltd., which oversees about $850 million, said in a phone interview. “The political concerns in Europe and the U.S. add volatility on a daily basis.” Fewer than 292 million shares of New York Stock Exchange- listed companies changed hands on the NYSE, the least in Bloomberg data going back to 2003, as the Big Board canceled trading and closing auctions in 216 securities after an outage in a computer that matches orders and processes transactions. Fiscal Cliff U.S. stocks had their biggest weekly decline in five months as President Barack Obama ’s re-election set up a budget showdown with the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. The S&P 500 fell 2.4 percent over five days last week, and has lost 5.3 percent since Oct. 18. The index is up 9.7 percent for the year through today. If Congress doesn’t act by the end of the year, $607 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases are scheduled to take effect starting in January. Obama invited the top Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress to the White House this week to begin talks on a plan to avert the so-called fiscal cliff. “What people don’t like in markets is uncertainty,” said Gilles Sitbon, who helps oversee $1.9 billion at Sycomore Asset Management in Paris. “People are waiting for one thing that could make the market go down. People are ready to pull the trigger. And if nothing happens, then you can get a grind higher. It’s confidence building.” ‘Large Risks’ Euro-area finance ministers met in Brussels today. While the ministers will probably not approve 31.5 billion euros ($40 billion) of financial aid to Greece, they will agree to prevent the country from defaulting on 5 billion euros of bills that mature on Nov. 16, a European official said on Nov. 9. The so-called troika that oversees euro-area Greece’s bailouts said it sees “very large risks” to the Greek program, according to a draft report obtained by Bloomberg News. The troika comprises the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Phone and health-care stocks rose the most among 10 groups in the S&P 500 today, while utilities and technology companies had the biggest declines. United Technologies Corp. (UTX) increased 1.5 percent to $76.95. AT&T Inc. (T) advanced 1 percent to $33.87. Jefferies (JEF) gained 14 percent to $16.27. Leucadia, the largest shareholder of Jefferies with a 29 percent stake, agreed to buy the the portion of the company it doesn’t already own for about $2.8 billion. Investors will receive 0.81 Leucadia share for each Jefferies share they own, the companies said today in a statement, valuing the entire company at $3.59 billion. New York-based Leucadia fell 3 percent to $21.14. Titanium Metals Titanium Metals surged 43 percent to $16.50. Precision Castparts, the maker of metal forgings for jet engines, agreed to buy Texas billionaire Harold Simmons’s Titanium Metals for $2.9 billion in its largest acquisition in almost two decades. Titanium Metals’ stockholders will get $16.50 a share, 44 percent more than the Dallas-based company’s closing price on Nov. 8, according to a statement after markets closed on Nov. 9. Precision Castparts added 4.9 percent to $179.69. Sherwin-Williams Co. (SHW) climbed 5.8 percent, the biggest gain since September 2011, to $149.06. The largest U.S. paint retailer agreed to acquire closely held Consorcio Comex SA de CV for about $2.34 billion including debt to gain Mexico’s largest paint maker as housing demand improves. Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) rose 14 percent to $73.93 after a combination of its experimental hepatitis C therapies cleared the virus in 100 percent of patients in a trial. Gilead, the world’s largest maker of HIV medicines, is among several drugmakers racing to develop new hepatitis C treatments that act faster with fewer side effects than the current standard of care. Homebuilders Tumble Celgene Corp. (CELG) , the fourth-largest biotechnology company, gained 5.8 percent to $75.66. The drugmaker reported its medicine for pancreatic cancer met goals of a late-stage study. All 11 members in the Supercomposite Homebuilding Index (S15HOME) dropped, with D.R. Horton Inc. losing 5.8 percent to $19.40. The largest U.S. homebuilder by volume fell after CEO Donald Tomnitz cautioned during a conference call that employment growth will remain weak next year, potentially hurting sales of new houses. Atlanta-based Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH) , which isn’t part of the S&P index, declined 17 percent to $13.77 after reporting a wider-than-estimated fourth-quarter loss. The S&P 500 Utilities Index fell for the eighth straight trading day, the longest losing streak in 10 years. The benchmark, which includes companies such as Duke Energy Corp. and Dominion Resources Inc., lost 0.8 percent and closed at the lowest level since April. Apple Falls Apple fell 0.8 percent to $542.83, after gaining as much as 1.4 percent earlier in the day. The shares have dropped 23 percent from their September high. Apple hasn’t been able to keep up with demand for the latest version of the iPhone, which accounts for about two-thirds of the company’s profit. J.C. Penney Co. tumbled 13 percent to $17.97, the lowest price since March 2009, as the department-store chain’s third- quarter sales plunge fueled investor concern about the viability of Chief Executive Officer Ron Johnson ’s turnaround plan. The shares fell 4.8 percent on Nov. 9 after the company reported a third-quarter loss greater than analysts estimated. The New York Stock Exchange canceled trading and closing auctions in 216 securities today after a malfunction in a computerized “matching engine.” The affected stocks, which included such companies as Travelers Cos. and U.S. Steel Corp., continued to trade on other exchanges, including the Nasdaq Stock Market. The exchange anticipates a “normal trading day in all securities tomorrow,” according to an e-mail to traders. Recession Risk “We’re watching the news headlines which will all be about the fiscal cliff for the next six weeks,” Thomas Nyheim , a Wilmington, Delaware-based fund manager for Christiana Trust, which oversees about $15 billion, said in a phone interview. Should policy-makers fail to reach an agreement on the fiscal cliff and the automatic spending cuts and tax increases go into effect at the beginning of 2013, the U.S. would enter a recession and could experience its second credit downgrade, according to Oppenheimer & Co. S&P cut its AAA rating in August 2011 after an impasse on the debt ceiling. The Dow alternated between losses and gains of 400 points on four days during that month, the longest streak on record. “Even though the U.S. has already weathered a downgrade earlier in the process of the current economic recovery, a second downgrade might not be as easily digested or received by the markets and foreign investors as the first,” John Stoltzfus, chief market strategist at Oppenheimer, wrote in a note today. Likely Up David Bianco , Deutsche Bank AG’s chief U.S. equity strategist, said the next 5 percent move in the S&P 500 is likely up and advised clients to use the dip to buy growth stocks. He cut his 2012 estimate for the benchmark index to 1,450 from 1,475, while reiterating a 12-month forecast of 1,500. “We still believe that the fiscal cliff will be averted with compromise legislation, but President Obama’s re-election and a larger Democrat majority in Senate raise the likely amount of tax hikes vs. spending cuts in the new legislation,” Bianco wrote in a Nov. 9 report.

Military Operations Israel’s shekel dropped 0.6 percent versus the dollar to the lowest level in over eight weeks as the country’s leaders said they “won’t hesitate” to escalate military operations against the Gaza Strip after two days of Palestinian rocket attacks.

Ascent Solar Rises on Strategic Shift to Consumer Devices,['Justin Doom'],2012-11-12 18:44:23,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/ascent-solar-rises-on-strategic-shift-to-consumer-devices.html,"Ascent Solar Technologies Inc. (ASTI) , the U.S. solar manufacturer that’s shifting its focus to consumer electronics, rose the most in almost a month after announcing a portable charging device. Ascent gained 5.9 percent to 90 cents at 12:53 p.m. in New York. Earlier it climbed 9.4 percent, the most intraday since Oct. 16. The company has gained 118 percent this year through Friday, compared with a 40 percent loss for the 17-member Bloomberg Global Large Solar Index. (BISOLAR)  Ascent, based in Thornton, Colorado , introduced the EnerPlex Kickr IV, a portable solar charger suitable for mobile phones and other consumer electronics, according to a statement today. The device complements existing products aimed at retail shoppers, and continues a strategic shift that began in June when the company announced a charging case for Apple Inc. iPhones. The company’s thin-film solar products are well suited for consumer applications, said Robert Stone, an analyst at Cowen & Co. in Boston. “There are a meaningful number of external battery cases that extend the lives of smartphones,” Stone said today in an interview. Ascent’s thin, light solar cells “may serve as a differentiator compared with several competitors.” Ascent hasn’t reported a profitable quarter since it went public in 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chief Executive Officer Victor Lee said in September that the company will be profitable by the third quarter of 2013, with consumer products generating as much as 80 percent of revenue. The company is also pursuing aerospace, transportation and off-grid product applications. Plunging Prices Prices for standard, photovoltaic panels made from polysilicon have dropped 55 percent in the past year to 79 cents a watt. That’s made it hard for Ascent to compete for volume shipments to developers planning large-scale solar farms, Stone said. “If you look at consumer products, you’re talking about much smaller devices, for which the price per watt is not a relevant figure,” he said. “It’s a question of how much volume this business can generate,” Stone said. “They’re going in the right direction.

Taiwan Stocks Tumble at Fastest Pace on Record Valuations,['Weiyi Lim'],2012-11-13 07:31:52,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/taiwanese-stocks-tumble-at-fastest-pace-on-record-valuations.html,"Taiwanese stocks are tumbling at the fastest pace in Asia as record high valuations versus the region and slumping exports prompt foreign investors to sell. The benchmark Taiex Index (TWSE) has lost 7.5 percent since the end of September, leading declines among Asia’s developed and emerging markets , after its average valuation reached 18 times estimated earnings, 43 percent higher than the MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP) ’s multiple. Overseas investors sold a net $803.5 million of Taipei-listed shares this quarter to yesterday, the second- biggest outflows after South Korea among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. Taiwan ’s falling exports have spurred China Merchants Securities Co.’s Ronald Wan to sell the island’s shares in the past two months and increase holdings of Chinese companies in Hong Kong, where the benchmark index for mainland equities is valued at a 51 percent discount versus the Taiex. While price- earnings ratios usually climb as growing investor confidence boosts stocks, Taiwanese valuations increased as earnings in the Taiex gauge slid 27 percent this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “Given the slower growth, I think the Taiwanese market is not cheap,” Wan, the Hong Kong-based managing director of China Merchants Securities, wrote in a Nov. 10 e-mail. “If the global market slows down, the Taiwan economy will be affected.” Biggest Drop Wan’s firm manages money for China Merchants Group, a state-owned conglomerate with $970 billion of assets. Daphne Roth , the Singapore-based head of Asia equity research at ABN Amro Private Bank, also prefers Hong Kong-listed Chinese shares as well as equities in South Korea, where the Kospi Index’s price-to-estimated earnings ratio is 44 percent lower than the Taiex’s 17.2 times. The Taiex sank 1.8 percent today, the most among Asian benchmark indexes tracked by Bloomberg, to 7,136.05, the lowest close since Oct. 29. Taiex trading volumes today were 31 percent more than the three-month daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Taiwan dollar forwards fell the most in two weeks as traders said the central bank was tightening restrictions on purchases of the local currency to limit appreciation that may hurt exports. “I am still quite cautious on Taiwan,” Roth, whose firm oversees about $207 billion, said by phone on Nov. 6. “Exports have come off quite a lot for the year. The visibility isn’t there yet.” Roth has a neutral view on Taiwanese equities. Acer (2353) Inc., Asia’s second-largest computer maker, and HTC Corp. (2498) , the region’s No. 2 smartphone producer, both reported falling shipments in the third quarter. Disappointing Profit HTC shares tumbled as much as 18 percent after the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based company forecast on Oct. 26 its lowest quarterly sales since 2010 for the three months through December. The stock slumped 6.8 percent today, snapping a five-day, 25 percent surge, after the stock exchange said it’s probing trading in HTC shares before the Nov. 11 announcement of a patents settlement with Apple Inc. Acer posted third-quarter profit on Oct. 22 that missed analysts’ estimates amid declining sales and market share. The Taipei-based company’s shipments in the period slumped 10.2 percent from a year earlier, more than the 8.3 percent drop in global shipments as estimated by Gartner Inc. Acer shares are down 13 percent since the results. Among Taiex companies that reported quarterly profit since the Sept. 30, 58 percent missed analyst estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. UBS AG, top ranked for Taiwan equity research in 2011 by Institutional Investor magazine, said in a Nov. 6 report it may downgrade its 2013 Taiwanese profit growth forecast. “To turn positive on the market, we may need to wait for an inflection point in tech shipment,” wrote William Dong and Camellia Cheng, Taipei-based analysts at UBS. ‘Cyclical Noise’ The slump in stocks is luring Howard Wang, JPMorgan Asset Management’s Hong Kong-based head of Greater China, who favors property developers. He declined to name specific companies. “I’m a buyer,” Wang, who oversees about $7.5 billion, said in an Oct. 30 e-mail. “There are lots of cheap equities in Taiwan once you remove the cyclical noise. They also tend to have higher dividend yields.” The Taiex has a dividend yield of 3.76 percent, the highest among Asia’s 10 largest markets. Overseas institutions were net buyers of equities in five of the seven days through yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They were net sellers in all but eight trading days in October, the data show. Foreign investors accounted for 33.69 percent of Taiwanese stock trading in the week to Nov. 2, according to data from the island’s stock exchange. Slowing Economy Taiwanese exports fell 1.9 percent in October, the eighth monthly decline this year. Overseas shipments will slump 2.5 percent this year, the government forecast on Oct. 31, increasing an earlier prediction for a 1.72 percent drop. The government cut its 2012 economic growth estimate to 1.05 percent from 1.66 percent as gross domestic product expanded a lower- than-estimated 1.02 percent in the third quarter. Bank Julius Baer & Co., which manages about $294 billion globally, is advising clients to favor stocks in Thailand and the Philippines , on expectations their economies are more protected than Taiwan’s from the global slowdown. Declines in Taiwanese stocks can be “more pronounced” during a global sell-off, said Kevin Pollack, a managing director at Paragon Capital in New York, said by e-mail on Nov. 8. “There is investor concern that Taiwanese companies, and demand for their products and services, may be more negatively impacted by weakening economic activity in Europe and negative global forecasts for Asian markets,” Pollack said. “Profit- taking is to be expected.” To contact the reporter on this story: Weiyi Lim in Singapore at  wlim26@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Darren Boey at  dboey@bloomberg.net",['Weiyi Lim'],"Taiwan Stocks Tumble at Fastest Pace on Record Valuations Taiwanese stocks are tumbling at the fastest pace in Asia as record high valuations versus the region and slumping exports prompt foreign investors to sell.

(MRX) was sued by Q-Med AB to block transfer of rights to its wrinkle gel Restylane to a competitor. Q-Med filed the lawsuit, which it described in court papers as “an action in aid of arbitration,” in federal court in Manhattan on Nov. 7. Medicis disclosed Q-Med’s lawsuit in a regulatory filing Nov. 9. Medicis in September said it had agreed to be acquired by Montreal-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX) in a transaction valued at $2.6 billion. In court filings, Q-Med described Valeant as its “direct competitor.” “Q-Med has informed Medicis that it will not consent to a change of control of Medicis that would result in a transfer to Valeant of the exclusive rights to market and sell Q-Med’s dermal filler products” including Restylane in North America , the Uppsala, Sweden-based company said in a filing. Asserting it will sustain “irreparable harm” if those rights are transferred while arbitration is pending, Q-Med asked for a court order temporarily blocking the transaction. U.S. District Judge Richard J. Sullivan ordered Medicis to respond to the injunction request by Nov. 14 and scheduled oral argument for Dec. 3. The media relations department of Scottsdale, Arizona-based Medicis didn’t immediately respond to a voice-mail message seeking comment on the suit. While Valeant isn’t named as a defendant in the case, the company assailed Q-Med’s claims in an e-mailed statement. “Not only does Q-Med have no entitlement to the injunctive relief it seeks, but its request for such an extreme remedy is predicated on a systematic misreading of its contracts with Medicis,” according to the Valeant statement.

Trademarks Village Voice Dismisses Trademark-Infringement Suit Against Yelp Village Voice Media Holdings LLC ’s trademark-infringement suit against Yelp Inc. (YELP) has settled less than two weeks after it was filed. The suit, filed in federal court in Arizona Oct. 25, had accused San Francisco-based Yelp of infringing the Voice’s “best of” trademarks. The newspaper publisher said it has been using these marks since 1979, and registered them with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Phoenix-based publisher objected to Yelp’s use of “Best of Phoenix,” “Best of San Francisco ,” “Best of Miami,” and similar terms on its Web pages. To no avail, the Voice said it sent Yelp a cease-and-desist letter on Sept. 18. Yelp is the operator of the social networking user-review site, and the Voice claimed that through the unauthorized use of the trademarks, the San Francisco company was causing confusion in the marketplace, and unfairly piggybacked on the fame and goodwill the Voice has developed for its trademarks. In its Nov. 11 filing, the Voice said simply that the parties had reached an agreement and that it was voluntarily dismissing the suit. Each party was to pay its own legal costs. The case is Village Voice Media Holdings LLC v. Yelp Inc., 2:12-cv-02285-MHB, U.S. District Court, District of Arizona (Phoenix). Strange Brewing Told by Strange Brew Company to Change Name Strange Brewing Co. , a Denver-based craft brewery, has been threatened with a trademark infringement suit by a Massachusetts company that sells home-brewing supplies, Denver’s Westword newspaper reported. Strange Brew Beer & Wine Making Supplies of Marlboro, Massachusetts, sent the brewery a letter warning that its customers were confused by the similarity of the names, and demanding that Strange Brewing change its name, according to Westword. The brewery responded, noting there are numerous instances to be found on the Internet of companies with “Strange Brew” in at least part of their names, and offering a license agreement with the brewing-supplies company, according to the newspaper. Westword published the Massachusetts company’s response letter in which it said that the license offer was “offensive,” and warning that if the brewery didn’t change its name, there would be “ formal legal action without further notice.” For more trademark news, click here.

Yelp is the operator of the social networking user-review site, and the Voice claimed that through the unauthorized use of the trademarks, the San Francisco company was causing confusion in the marketplace, and unfairly piggybacked on the fame and goodwill the Voice has developed for its trademarks. In its Nov. 11 filing, the Voice said simply that the parties had reached an agreement and that it was voluntarily dismissing the suit. Each party was to pay its own legal costs. The case is Village Voice Media Holdings LLC v. Yelp Inc., 2:12-cv-02285-MHB, U.S. District Court, District of Arizona (Phoenix). Strange Brewing Told by Strange Brew Company to Change Name Strange Brewing Co. , a Denver-based craft brewery, has been threatened with a trademark infringement suit by a Massachusetts company that sells home-brewing supplies, Denver’s Westword newspaper reported. Strange Brew Beer & Wine Making Supplies of Marlboro, Massachusetts, sent the brewery a letter warning that its customers were confused by the similarity of the names, and demanding that Strange Brewing change its name, according to Westword. The brewery responded, noting there are numerous instances to be found on the Internet of companies with “Strange Brew” in at least part of their names, and offering a license agreement with the brewing-supplies company, according to the newspaper. Westword published the Massachusetts company’s response letter in which it said that the license offer was “offensive,” and warning that if the brewery didn’t change its name, there would be “ formal legal action without further notice.” For more trademark news, click here.

Huawei Technologies Sees African Revenue Growing Up to 30%,['Eric Ombok'],2012-11-13 11:45:55,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/huawei-technologies-sees-african-revenue-growing-as-much-as-30-.html,"Huawei Technologies Co., China ’s largest phone-equipment maker, said revenue in southern and eastern Africa may climb as much as 30 percent in the next three years as growth on the continent outpaces most regions. The company plans to capitalize on low mobile-broadband penetration rates and increasing demand for smart phones in Africa, Li Dafeng, president for eastern and southern Africa, said in an interview in Nairobi, the capital, on Nov. 7. Huawei, based in Shenzhen in southern China, will also focus on developing its enterprise business that supplies equipment to governments and companies, he said. Africa has less than five mobile-broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, compared with more than 10 percent in the rest of the world, according to the International Telecommunications Union, a Geneva-based industry group. Over the next five years the continent is expected to be the fastest growing region in terms of mobile-phone connections, according to A.T. Kearney , a Chicago-based consultancy. “There is still much room to grow, so we can see that in the next three years network availability will be improved greatly,” Chief Technology Officer for East & Southern Africa Region Radoslaw Kedzia said at the interview. “This is why we can grow 20 percent to 30 percent.” Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to accelerate to 5.7 percent next year from 5 percent this year, outpacing every other region except developing Asia, the International Monetary Fund said last month. Angola, Kenya Huawei’s southern and eastern African business comprises 25 countries including South Africa , Angola and Kenya. The company posted revenue from Africa of $3.42 billion in 2011, up 15 percent from 2010, Li said. Total sales in Africa account for 13 percent of global revenue, the company said in an e-mailed statement. “If you look at the penetration of mobile broadband compared to European countries or compared with China, there is a lot of potential,” Li said. “In my region, the penetration of smart phones is 10 percent. In China, mobile broadband penetration is 30 percent, in Europe it is more than 50 percent and 16 percent in Kenya. So there is still a lot of potential.” Nigeria , Africa ’s most-populous nation, is Huawei’s biggest market for its carrier division on the continent, which supplies equipment to mobile-phone companies, Kedzia said. South Africa In South Africa, the continent’s largest economy that contributes 30 percent of the company’s African revenue, Huawei plans to grow market share as the country seeks to achieve 100 percent broadband penetration by 2020, Li said. Huawei sold 20 million smart phones globally in 2011 and estimates it will sell another 60 million units this year, earning revenue of $9 billion, he said. “Huawei’s IDEOS, the first under-$100 smart phone, has become popular in the region, gaining a market share of 45 percent in Kenya,” Li said. “We have sold 250,000 pieces since its launch last year.” Globally, Huawei is the third-biggest maker of smartphones by sales, according to data from the company. It sold 16 million units in the third quarter compared with 27 million by Apple Inc. (AAPL) and 56 million by Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the market leader. The U.S. Congress last month said Huawei and ZTE Corp. (763) , China’s second-biggest telephone equipment manufacturer, provide opportunities for Chinese intelligence services to tamper with U.S. telecommunications networks for spying. A report by the House intelligence committee report said the companies failed to explain their relationship with the Chinese government. Li rejected the criticism. ‘No Links’ “Huawei is just a telecommunications manufacturer, we have no link with government,” Li said. “The only relationship between Huawei and the government is the business. We provide some solutions, some products, this is the only relationship.” Huawei’s customers in eastern and southern Africa include South Africa’s five mobile operators, including Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) and MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) Other clients are Angola’s Unitel SA and Movicel Telecomunicacoes Lda and Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) of Kenya, East Africa’s biggest mobile-phone operator. The company has a research and development center in South Africa and seven training facilities in the region, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt and Morocco. The company has helped 18 African governments build networks in countries such as Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Senegal , Angola, Guinea , and Djibouti. The company also plans employ more local workers on the continent to boost the ratio of domestically hired employees to 70 percent from 60 percent, Li said, without saying by when.

RIM to Unveil BlackBerry 10 on Jan. 30 in Turnaround Bid,['Hugo Miller'],2012-11-12 21:26:54,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/rim-to-unveil-blackberry-10-on-jan-30-as-part-of-comeback-bid.html,"Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) plans to showcase the first two of its BlackBerry 10 smartphones on Jan. 30 and then start selling the devices in February, moving forward with a critical step in its comeback bid. “We want to do it as quickly as possible,” Chief Operating Officer Kristian Tear said in an interview following RIM’s announcement of the Jan. 30 date earlier in the day. Though the first phones won’t go on sale simultaneously worldwide, RIM is aiming for a release on multiple continents within 30 days of the unveiling, Tear said. The rollout will finally get the BlackBerry 10 into consumers’ hands after multiple product delays put the phones a year behind schedule. RIM needs a hit to help it reverse market- share losses over the past two years to Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and devices running Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software. While customers will still have to wait 11 weeks until they know exactly when the BlackBerry 10 will go on sale, today’s announcement helps assure them that the product is coming, said Steven Li, an analyst at Raymond James in Toronto. Until now, RIM has only officially said that the BlackBerry 10 will be released in the first quarter of 2013. “They’ve got to keep the buzz going,” said Li, who rates RIM the equivalent of a hold. “They don’t have a new product for the holidays, so this was the right thing to do.” Stock Gain RIM rose 3.2 percent to $8.81 at the close in New York. After hitting a nine-year low on Sept. 24, the stock has gained almost 40 percent on speculation that the BlackBerry 10 will reinvigorate sales. Even so, the shares remain more than 90 percent below their 2008 peak. The stock rallied on Oct. 31 after the company said that more than 50 carriers have begun lab-testing the phones, a process that typically takes 60 to 90 days. On Nov. 8, RIM said BlackBerry 10 had won security certification from the U.S. government, the first time that the company’s handsets have been certified for FIPS, or Federal Information Processing Standards, before their commercial debut. That will be key to cementing RIM’s reputation as the most secure smartphone on the market, said Michael Brown , RIM’s vice president for security product management. That will help maintain the support of government agencies, a key market, he said. RIM alone can’t set BlackBerry 10’s release schedule since it’s relying on carriers to offer the devices, said Carl Howe , an analyst at research firm Yankee Group in Boston. Carrier Talks Discussions between RIM and its biggest carrier partners, such as AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Wireless in the U.S. and Orange SA and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) in Europe, will hinge on what other models are part of the mobile-phone operators’ marketing plans, Howe said. “It’s a negotiation,” Howe said. Emerging markets in Latin America , Africa and Asia have helped the company increase its customer base in recent months, even as North American users switch to other phones. Chief Marketing Officer Frank Boulben said in July that the introduction of BlackBerry 10 devices would be widespread. He didn’t name countries and didn’t say whether the U.S. would be included initially. “Will it be three continents or five, five countries or 10?” he said. “I don’t know the specifics yet, but it will be multiple countries on multiple continents.” Overseas Debut? Choosing to initially release the device outside the U.S. to generate more buzz might be a worthwhile strategy, Howe said. “The hypothesis that they might start outside the U.S. is possible, as it would give them some pretty good sales numbers early,” he said. “They could launch with several million units sold within weeks.” Howe said he likes what he’s seen of the BlackBerry 10 operating system. The technology is designed to offer better multitasking by letting users “peek” at one program with their finger while running another. “It’s very true to their heritage and is a very good platform for getting work done,” he said. RIM ranks far behind the iPhone and Android devices in the smartphone market, putting it in a race with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) for third place. Microsoft unveiled its latest platform, Windows Phone 8, last month, giving it a head start. Still, it’s too early to say if Windows will push the BlackBerry to the sidelines. RIM has an opportunity to catch up, Howe said. “They want to be counted, and Microsoft has left them an opening to do that,” he said.

Verizon Unions to Offer Health-Plan Consolidation to End Dispute,['Sarah Frier'],2011-10-01 04:01:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-01/verizon-unions-to-offer-health-plan-consolidation-to-end-dispute.html,"Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) unions representing about 45,000 workers are preparing to propose the consolidation of health-care plans next week, as a step toward ending a labor dispute that began over the summer. The unions will suggest putting their members on the same health plan, which would save the company money, rather than asking them to begin paying premiums, said Bill Huber, a business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Verizon and the unions haven’t been able to reach agreement on a new contract since the old one expired in August. Workers went on strike Aug. 7 and later returned to their jobs as negotiations continue. The unions also plan to protest and pass out leaflets at Verizon Wireless locations and Apple Inc. (AAPL) stores next week, during the expected launch of the next iPhone. Workers will ask consumers to delay buying the iPhone 5 until Verizon agrees to a new contract. “We have no illusions that just because we’re going to put a new proposal on the table they’ll say, ‘Great, accept it.’” said Bob Master, political director for the Communications Workers of America. “This is a big step up to intensify pressure on the company. We’ll use every tactic at our disposal.” The proposal would be a step in the right direction, said Rich Young, a spokesman for Verizon. The company deals with more than 12 health providers, and workers in some regions can choose from as many as five plans, he said. “As we strive to modernize, to change our wireline business, this is an area that could help greatly,” said Young. “It’s not cost-effective to have more than a dozen different plans in different states.” ‘Encourage’ Young declined to say whether Verizon would accept the proposal. He said the company still wants workers to contribute more toward their health-care costs, including by paying premiums. The company spends $400,000 an hour on employee health care, he said. Verizon Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam said last week at an investor conference he was encouraged by the unions’ progress since they returned from the strike in August. He has said the company needs concessions from unions because of the landline division’s customer losses and eroding profitability. The company’s wireless business was largely unaffected by the strike. Verizon’s revenue and profit fell last year as declines in the landline business offset growth in wireless. The number of fixed lines, including residential and business customers, slid 8.2 percent to 26 million at the end of last year, extending declines since 2003. During the same period, wireless subscribers more than doubled to 94.1 million. Verizon slipped 35 cents to $36.80 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 2.9 percent this year.

S&P 500 Has Longest Drop Since July Amid Europe Concern,['Lu Wang' 'Inyoung Hwang'],2012-09-26 20:49:44,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/u-s-stock-futures-are-little-changed-freeport-retreats.html,"U.S. stocks fell for a fifth day, sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its longest retreat since July, as concern grew Europe’s debt crisis is worsening. PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) dropped 4.7 percent, helping to give homebuilders their biggest decline since June, after new homes sales missed estimates. Energy and technology companies dropped the most among the benchmark gauge’s 10 industry groups as oil fell to a seven-week low and Jabil Circuit Inc. (JBL) tumbled 9.9 percent amid a disappointing forecast. The S&P 500 slid 0.6 percent to 1,433.32 in New York. The benchmark index is down 1.9 percent over five days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 44.04 points, or 0.3 percent, to 13,413.51 today. Almost 6.4 billion shares traded hands on U.S. exchanges, 6.3 percent higher than the three-month average. “We’re at a point where stimulus continues to be added and yet we’re seeing no meaningful improvements in the global economy,” Sean Lynch, the Omaha, Nebraska-based global investment strategist for Wells Fargo Private Bank, which oversees $169 billion, said in a telephone interview. “When you figure in some of the political risks along with Spain and Greece leading headlines once again, it makes equity investors want to pause right now.” Stocks worldwide fell as Germany, the Netherlands and Finland said late yesterday that Spain should bear the cost of problems in their banks, with the European Stability Mechanism assuming only a limited burden in recapitalizations. The Bank of Spain said the economy kept falling at a “significant pace” in the third quarter. Highest Levels U.S. equity indexes fell yesterday from their highest levels in almost five years as Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said new bond buying announced by the Fed this month probably won’t boost growth or hiring. The S&P 500 has erased all its gains since the Federal Open Market Committee said Sept. 13 that it will undertake a third round of quantitative easing by purchasing mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month until labor markets “improve substantially.” Optimism that central banks around the world will take steps to boost economic growth has sent the S&P 500 up 14 percent this year. The European Central Bank this month approved unlimited bond-buying programs while the Bank of Japan unexpectedly increased its asset-purchase target. Investor Complacency “The Fed cheerleading and stimulus has lulled investors into a sense of complacency that the Fed can keep the economy afloat and growing,” Eric Thorne, who helps oversee about $6 billion at Bryn Mawr Trust Co. in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, said in a phone interview. “We’re afraid when reality sets in that this economic recovery may take longer than expected, the market could pull back quickly and meaningfully.” The S&P 500 has rallied 5.2 percent so far in the third quarter and pension funds may need to sell stocks this week to rebalance their asset allocations, according to UBS AG strategist Boris Rjavinski. U.S. pensions, which UBS estimates hold about 55 percent of their $5 trillion in stocks, may pull as much as $36 billion from equities and put as much as $19 billion into fixed income, Rjavinski wrote in a note to clients dated Sept. 24.

PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) dropped 4.7 percent, helping to give homebuilders their biggest decline since June, after new homes sales missed estimates. Energy and technology companies dropped the most among the benchmark gauge’s 10 industry groups as oil fell to a seven-week low and Jabil Circuit Inc. (JBL) tumbled 9.9 percent amid a disappointing forecast. The S&P 500 slid 0.6 percent to 1,433.32 in New York. The benchmark index is down 1.9 percent over five days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 44.04 points, or 0.3 percent, to 13,413.51 today. Almost 6.4 billion shares traded hands on U.S. exchanges, 6.3 percent higher than the three-month average. “We’re at a point where stimulus continues to be added and yet we’re seeing no meaningful improvements in the global economy,” Sean Lynch, the Omaha, Nebraska-based global investment strategist for Wells Fargo Private Bank, which oversees $169 billion, said in a telephone interview. “When you figure in some of the political risks along with Spain and Greece leading headlines once again, it makes equity investors want to pause right now.” Stocks worldwide fell as Germany, the Netherlands and Finland said late yesterday that Spain should bear the cost of problems in their banks, with the European Stability Mechanism assuming only a limited burden in recapitalizations. The Bank of Spain said the economy kept falling at a “significant pace” in the third quarter. Highest Levels U.S. equity indexes fell yesterday from their highest levels in almost five years as Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said new bond buying announced by the Fed this month probably won’t boost growth or hiring. The S&P 500 has erased all its gains since the Federal Open Market Committee said Sept. 13 that it will undertake a third round of quantitative easing by purchasing mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month until labor markets “improve substantially.” Optimism that central banks around the world will take steps to boost economic growth has sent the S&P 500 up 14 percent this year. The European Central Bank this month approved unlimited bond-buying programs while the Bank of Japan unexpectedly increased its asset-purchase target. Investor Complacency “The Fed cheerleading and stimulus has lulled investors into a sense of complacency that the Fed can keep the economy afloat and growing,” Eric Thorne, who helps oversee about $6 billion at Bryn Mawr Trust Co. in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, said in a phone interview. “We’re afraid when reality sets in that this economic recovery may take longer than expected, the market could pull back quickly and meaningfully.” The S&P 500 has rallied 5.2 percent so far in the third quarter and pension funds may need to sell stocks this week to rebalance their asset allocations, according to UBS AG strategist Boris Rjavinski. U.S. pensions, which UBS estimates hold about 55 percent of their $5 trillion in stocks, may pull as much as $36 billion from equities and put as much as $19 billion into fixed income, Rjavinski wrote in a note to clients dated Sept. 24. The largest outflows will be from stocks of large U.S. companies, with as much as $21 billion being sold, the strategist said.

European Stocks Drop Most Since July Before Spain Budget,['Adria Cimino'],2012-09-26 16:07:43,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/european-stock-futures-drop-as-plosser-warns-on-stimulus.html,"European stocks slid the most in two months as Spain prepared to present its budget and Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said the third round of bond buying may fail to stimulate growth. Acciona SA (ANA) sank 9.9 percent, leading Spanish builders lower a day before the government presents its budget for next year. Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s largest lender, retreated 4.5 percent. Anglo American Plc (AAL) lost 3.7 percent after saying that it plans to reduce its production of coal. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index plunged 1.8 percent to 270.72 at the close, its largest drop since July 23. The equity benchmark has still rallied 16 percent from this year’s low on June 4 as European Central Bank policy makers approved a plan to buy the bonds of the most-indebted members of the euro area. European (SXXP) equities trade at 12 times their estimated earnings, close to the highest valuation since 2010. “Markets have started to turn,” said Andreas Utermann, global chief investment officer at Allianz Global Investors, which oversees $360 billion, in a television interview. “People are facing up to the reality of a macro economy that’s not good. We’ve seen QE3 and now we’re back to the real world. Monetary easing doesn’t necessarily produce growth.” Plosser said yesterday after the close of European trading that the Fed’s latest round of quantitative easing may jeopardize the central bank’s credibility. The S&P 500 posted its biggest drop since June 25. Asset Buying The Federal Open Market Committee said on Sept. 13 that it will buy mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month until the labor market improves. Policy makers have turned to unconventional tools to attack unemployment that has stayed above 8 percent since February 2009. In Spain, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has struggled to persuade people to accept the deepest austerity measures on record. Unions and protest groups, spurred by the Portuguese government’s decision to drop a planned tax increase following demonstrations, have demanded a referendum on Rajoy’s cuts.

Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro will unveil the 2013 budget. In Greece today, public- and private-sector workers will hold a 24-hour general strike.

Santander sank 4.5 percent 5.92 euros, while Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) declined 4.8 percent to 6.20 euros.

RadioShack CEO Gooch Leaves as Lively Named Interim Chief,['Leslie Patton' 'Chris Burritt'],2012-09-26 20:30:30,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/radioshack-ceo-gooch-steps-down-cfo-lively-named-interim.html,"RadioShack Corp. (RSH) , the electronics retailer whose shares have plunged 73 percent this year, said Chief Executive Officer James Gooch left after 16 months on the job and was replaced on an interim basis by its finance chief. The board and Gooch, 45, agreed that he would step down, effective immediately, the Fort Worth , Texas-based company said in a statement today, without specifying a reason. The board plans to use an executive search firm to help find a successor. RadioShack suspended its dividend in July after posting an unexpected loss amid sluggish consumer spending and increasing dependence on mobile-phone sales. Selling lower-margin Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhones ate into the retailer’s profitability, Gooch said at the time. The company also is facing increasing competition from Best Buy Co., which is opening smaller stores dedicated to selling mobile phones, e-readers and tablets. “Gooch simply was not effective, and a change clearly needed to be made,” Anthony Chukumba , an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets in New York, said in a note. He rates the shares hold. “We find the timing a bit curious given the fact Gooch was CEO for just over a year and the start of the crucial holiday selling season is less than two months away.” RadioShack rose 1.6 percent to $2.60 at 4:15 p.m. in New York. Right Time “The board decided the timing was right for this decision,” Eric Bruner, a RadioShack spokesman, said by e-mail. He declined to elaborate and said Dorvin Lively, who is now interim chief, wasn’t available for an interview. “This was a mutual decision in the best interest of the company,” Bruner said. Contracts protecting against RadioShack’s default rose 2.2 percentage points to 37.2 percent upfront as of 10:30 a.m. in New York , according to data provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. That’s in addition to 5 percent a year, meaning it would cost $3.72 million initially and $500,000 annually for five years to protect $10 million of RadioShack’s debt. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, rise as investor confidence deteriorates and fall as it improves. ‘Driving Traffic’ Julian Day, RadioShack’s previous chief executive, hired Gooch as finance chief in 2006 after they worked together at Kmart Holding Corp. Gooch succeeded Day as CEO last year and had been working to spur stagnant sales. Analysts estimate the company will post a net loss of $27.2 million this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “The real challenge of someone like RadioShack is driving traffic to their stores,” said Brian Nagel, a New York-based analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., who rates the shares market perform, the equivalent of a hold. “They have a store format that is largely ineffective -- it’s too big to sell wireless and too small to sell most other product categories.” Lively, 54, joined RadioShack last year after being CFO at Ace Hardware Corp. He also worked at Maidenform Brands Inc. (MFB) and Toys “R” Us Inc. Scott Young resigned as RadioShack’s chief merchandise officer in June, according to a regulatory filing. The retailer has about 4,700 company-run stores in the U.S. and Mexico , as well as 1,500 wireless phone centers in the U.S. and 1,100 dealer and other outlets worldwide.

Barnes & Noble Unveils 9-Inch Nook as Cheaper IPad,['Matt Townsend'],2012-09-26 20:07:26,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/barnes-noble-unveils-9-inch-nook-as-cheaper-ipad.html,"While Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS) Chief Executive Officer William Lynch describes Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) iPad as a great product, even a “juggernaut,” he also has a few criticisms. Mainly that it’s expensive and weighs too much. Once Lynch could be certain that New York-based Barnes & Noble could build a tablet with similar dimensions to the best- selling iPad that was also cheaper and lighter, he went ahead with the project after killing it twice. The result is the 9- inch Nook HD+ that goes on sale today for $269. The newest iPad starts at $499 and weighs 27 percent more. “We think there is a big market there” below the pricing of the iPad, Lynch said yesterday in an interview. “We’re starting this product at $269 for a large-format tablet, which is a wow, disruptive price point.” The largest U.S. bookstore chain’s new devices, which also include a 7-inch Nook HD starting at $199, will also take on Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN) updated set of Kindle Fires that were announced Sept. 6. The online retailer, which also pitched its new devices as a cheaper competitor to the iPad, starts its 7- inch tablet at $199 and an 8.9-inch at $299. Barnes & Noble rose 6 percent to $12.99 at the close in New York. The shares have dropped 10 percent this year. Both Amazon and Barnes & Noble have increased access to content beyond digital books and touted specifications such as screen resolution and processing speed as selling points to expand their customer base beyond readers. Kindle Competition Nook Video, announced yesterday, will allow users to buy movies and television shows from providers such as HBO and Walt Disney Studios. The video, like other Nook content, can then be stored via cloud computing and accessed on multiple devices. “Side by side with the new Kindle Fires, they are competitive,” said Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst for Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Getting consumers to choose the Nook over an iPad will be much more difficult because Apple customers care less about price, she said. Barnes & Noble has anchored its future to digital books by investing in the Nook at the expense of profits as more readers embrace the technology. Revenue from the Nook unit, which includes devices and e-books, surged 34 percent to $933 million in the fiscal year through April 28 while sales at its retail and college units declined 1.6 percent to $6.6 billion. Releasing new devices is part of Barnes & Noble’s plan to maintain and expand its 25 percent share of the U.S. e-book market -- a portion it never attained in the market for printed books. Digital content sales, which are more profitable than printed books, more than doubled last year to $483 million. Wal-Mart Advantage This marks the fourth straight year that Barnes & Noble has announced a new device for the holiday shopping season after unveiling the first Nook in October 2009. This time it will face more competition following new tablets being released by Google Inc. (GOOG) , Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and possibly a smaller version of the iPad. That hasn’t stopped Barnes & Noble from producing the most Nooks ever for the holidays, Lynch said. The devices will help it gain share in tablets as well as it being featured in Target Corp. (TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) outlets while top competitor Amazon isn’t, he said. Wal-Mart said it would stop selling Kindles last week after Target took similar action in May. “For new customer acquisition, that’s a strength,” Epps said. The majority of Barnes & Noble’s shoppers are women, and the retailer kept them in mind when designing the new devices. The 7-inch Nook is skinnier and lighter than a comparable Amazon device, making it easier for holding by a woman’s smaller hands, the company said. Less weight also makes it easier for any user to read a book or watch a movie for several hours, Lynch said. Courting Women Barnes & Noble is going after moms and families by offering customized profiles. This would, for example, enable a parent to create a profile for their children that would keep content such as an R-rated film out of their library. “If you are making a portable media device and you don’t solve for women, you are paying attention to the wrong consumer segment,” said Lynch. Women buy 57 percent of books and more than 60 percent of magazines, he said. The new devices also have a revamped store that offers a recommendation service called Nook Channels that combines the knowledge of human booksellers with algorithms to serve up options. The products will ship in late October and be available in Barnes & Noble stores and other chains, including Best Buy Co. (BBY) , in early November. U.K. Expansion The new devices will also be sold in more than 1,600 locations this holiday season in the U.K., including Dixons Retail Plc, Argos stores and John Lewis Partnership Plc. This marks the first time the Nook will be sold outside the U.S. Barnes & Noble agreed to a deal in April with Microsoft that would give the software-maker a stake in a unit that combines the Nook and college divisions for $300 million. As part of the agreement, Microsoft will help develop a Nook application for Windows 8, the latest version of the operating system to be released next month, and also spend $305 million over five years to help the Nook expand overseas. The deal will be signed in the next few weeks, Lynch said. The international expansion will be led by Patrick Rouvillois, the former global chief marketing officer at Carrefour SA, Barnes & Noble announced yesterday. “This looks to be a great hire for Barnes & Noble, as the company expands,” David Strasser , an analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott in New York, wrote today in a note to clients.

"Stocks Retreat With Euro, Oil as Spain Bond Yields Surge",['Stephen Kirkl' '' 'Lu Wang'],2012-09-26 20:28:59,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/asian-stocks-fall-as-oil-drops-on-growth-concern-aussie-slides.html,"Stocks (MXWD) fell, sending Europe’s benchmark index down the most in two months, while the euro weakened and Spain ’s 10-year yield topped 6 percent as protests against austerity measures fueled concern the debt crisis will worsen. Treasuries extended the longest rally since 2008. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.6 percent to 1,433.32 at 4 p.m. in New York after tumbling 1.1 percent yesterday, the most in three months. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) lost 1.8 percent in its biggest drop since July 23. The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.2866 and Spain’s 10-year yields jumped as high as 6.07 percent. Treasuries rose for an eighth day, with the 10-year yield down five basis points to 1.62 percent. Oil slid below $90 a barrel for the first time since August. Germany, the Netherlands and Finland said late yesterday Spain should bear the cost of problems in their banks, with the European Stability Mechanism assuming only a limited burden in recapitalizations. The Bank of Spain said the economy kept falling at a “significant pace” in the third quarter. Reports showed new U.S. home sales trailed the median economist estimate, French consumer confidence dropped for a third month in September and Italian retail sales declined in July. “There’s an ongoing drip feed of negative news,” said Richard McGuire , a fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in London. The ESM announcement “appears to cast some doubt as to whether Spain will be able to disburden itself of the liabilities it will assume via its banking bailout.” QE3 Rally Fades The S&P 500 has rallied 5.2 percent so far in the third quarter and pension funds may need to sell stocks this week to rebalance asset allocations, according to UBS AG strategist Boris Rjavinski. U.S. pensions, which UBS estimates hold about 55 percent of their $5 trillion in stocks, may pull as much as $36 billion from equities and put as much as $19 billion into fixed income, Rjavinski wrote in a note dated Sept. 24. The largest outflows will be from stocks of large U.S. companies, with as much as $21 billion being sold, the strategist projected. The S&P 500 fell for a fifth straight day, the longest losing streak since July, and has erased its gain since the Federal Reserve announced a third round of quantitative easing on Sept. 13. Stocks slid yesterday as Fed Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said yesterday more bond purchases probably won’t boost growth or create jobs. ‘Too Many Eggs’ “There are too many eggs in the Fed basket,” Eric Thorne, who helps oversee about $6 billion at Bryn Mawr Trust Co. in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania , said in a phone interview. “The Fed cheerleading and stimulus has lulled investors into a sense of complacency that the Fed can keep the economy afloat and growing. We worry that the reality of the situation is that the Fed can only do so much.” American Express Co., Walt Disney Co. and Bank of America Corp. lost more than 1 percent to lead declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Jabil Circuit Inc. tumbled 9.9 percent, the biggest drop in the S&P 500 , following an earnings forecast that trailed analysts’ estimates. PulteGroup Inc., Lennar Corp. and D.R. Horton Inc. slid at least 3.9 percent to pace losses in all 11 stocks in an S&P gauge of homebuilders. New-home sales decreased 0.3 percent to a 373,000 annual pace following a revised 374,000 rate in July that was higher than previously estimated and the strongest since April 2010, figures from the Commerce Department showed. The median estimate of 71 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a rise to 380,000. European Leaders Banks and automakers led losses on the Stoxx 600, as all 19 industry groups retreated. ICAP Plc fell 3.3 percent after the world’s largest broker of transactions between banks forecast first-half revenue will declined 14 percent. Imagination Technologies Group Plc, a U.K. designer of parts for Apple Inc.’s iPhone, sank 9.6 percent as Reuters reported that Texas Instruments Inc. will shift the focus of its wireless investment away from smartphones. The euro fell against 12 of its 16 major peers, dropping as much as 0.7 percent versus the yen. The dollar strengthened against 14 of 16 major peers. Options traders are boosting bullish wagers at the fastest pace in three years on an exchange-traded fund that tracks the U.S. dollar , betting the currency will continue its rebound from a four-month low. The ratio of outstanding calls on the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund versus puts has more than doubled since its Sept. 11 low to 3.41-to-1 at the end of last week, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That was the largest increase for any comparable period since November 2009. The ETF climbed 0.9 percent from a 10-month low on Sept. 14. Spanish Yields Spain’s 10-year yield rose 32 basis points to 6.06 percent and the two-year note yield jumped 29 basis points to 3.46 percent. The yield on two-year Italian debt climbed 13 basis points to 2.45 percent. Ten-year German yields slid 13 basis points to 1.46 percent. Madrid faces a second night of protests after the anarchist union CNT called for a demonstration tonight, coinciding with a general strike in Greece. Catalan President Artur Mas yesterday called early elections to push for “self-determination” for the country’s largest region, another setback as Prime Minister Mario Rajoy attempts to get public backing for the deepest budget cuts on record. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe index of credit- default swaps on 14 governments increased 12 basis points to 148, the highest level in a week. Oil fell 1.5 percent to $89.98 a barrel. Prices dropped for the seventh time in eight days after the Energy Department said total U.S. fuel use decreased 1.1 percent in the four weeks ended Sept. 21 and inventories remained at the highest level for this time of the year since 1990. The S&P GSCI Index declined 1 percent as zinc, corn and coffee lead losses in 20 of 24 commodities in the gauge. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) dropped 1.1 percent, the most since July 23. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies traded in Hong Kong and the Shanghai Composite Index both fell 1.2 percent.

Nokia Dividend Elimination Looms as Cash Dwindles,['Adam Ewing'],2012-09-27 23:00:16,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/nokia-dividend-elimination-looms-as-cash-dwindles.html,"CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story on the web mistakenly stated in the headline that Nokia had canceled its dividend. The company has not announced such a move, though investors and analysts expect it may happen. As Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) depletes its cash pile amid a prolonged turnaround effort, investors are bracing for something that hasn’t happened in decades: no dividends. The unprofitable phonemaker is consuming about $300 million a month, and many investors and bondholders say the company risks running out of funds as it struggles to gain traction for its smartphones, which trail Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and devices using Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android. “Most crucial for Nokia now is to turn around their sales and reach profitability as soon as possible,” said Mikael Anttila, who helps manage corporate bonds, including Nokia debt, at SEB AB in Stockholm. “Until then, it would be rational for them to not pay dividends, to help maintain what cash they have.” Without a dividend, Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop risks alienating yield-focused investors at a time when Nokia’s stock price is headed for its fifth consecutive annual decline. The cash concerns underscore the depth of Nokia’s crisis. The company has paid a dividend every year since at least 1989, which is as far back as its electronic records go. Even the breakup of the Soviet Union , a major buyer of Nokia’s networking gear whose demise spelled financial tumult for the company more than 20 years ago, didn’t prevent it from returning cash to investors. Paper Mill Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland , will probably omit the payout for 2012 after slashing it by more than half over the past four years to 20 cents a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. To maintain the dividend at its current level, Nokia would have to pay about 750 million euros ($964 million) annually out of its dwindling bank account. Doug Dawson , a spokesman for Nokia, declined to comment on dividend plans. The phonemaker typically announces its annual payout when it reports fourth-quarter earnings in January. Founded in 1865 as a pulp and paper mill on the Nokia River, the company expanded into mobile phones in the 1980s and became Europe ’s most valuable corporation at the height of the technology boom. But Nokia was slow to adapt as touchscreen smartphones became the real drivers of the mobile handset market, and its stock has plunged about 90 percent since Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007. The company has announced more than 20,000 job cuts, closed production and research facilities and sold patents and other assets in a bid to become profitable again. Dwindling Cash Nokia lost 2.34 billion euros in the first half and analysts estimate losses will continue at least six more quarters , the average projections compiled by Bloomberg show. Its net cash has shrunk by half in the past five years to 4.2 billion euros at the of June and will drop below 3 billion euros by year-end, Standard & Poor’s predicts. Gross cash at the end of June was 9.4 billion euros. Nokia also has debt of 5.2 billion euros and some repayments are looming. A 1.25 billion-euro bond matures in February 2014, and the company faces repayments in 2016, 2017 and 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A 1.5 billion-euro revolving credit facility could help Nokia shore up its cash reserves. The cost of insuring Nokia bonds using credit-default swaps has almost tripled this year and reached a record of 1,240 basis points on July 18. It added 18 basis points, or 1.9 percent, to 950.58 basis points as of 4:48 p.m. Helsinki time, the biggest intraday jump in three weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Credit-Default Swaps Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. With Nokia’s debt at junk status with the three main rating companies, it should already have suspended dividends, said Sami Sarkamies, a Nordea Bank AB analyst in Helsinki. “It was a mistake not to stop the dividend payment given the weakened outlook,” he said. “This may cost shareholders dearly if Nokia for example needs to pull the plug early on its smartphone revamp due to not being able to afford the costs.” Nokia controlled more than half of global smartphone sales before the first iPhone and Android devices were introduced. Today Nokia’s share in smartphones is about 6.6 percent, according to research firm IDC. IPhone and Android combined make up 85 percent of the market. IPhone Challenge Nokia last year abandoned its home-grown operating system and began using the Windows operating system from Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , where CEO Elop used to work. On Sept. 5, Nokia introduced two new models that run Windows Phone 8, the newest version of the program that Nokia is betting on to lure customers away from Apple and Google. The phones will face off against the iPhone 5, which was unveiled on Sept. 12 and shattered the first-day sales of the previous version. Nokia is set to start rolling out its new Lumia models, with Italian carriers and Sweden ’s largest operator among the first to disclose a debut for the devices. They will be offered in mid-November in Italy by Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , 3 Italia SpA and Wind Telecomunicazioni SpA. The Lumia 920 will be priced at 599 euros and the Lumia 820 at 499 euros in the country. TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) in Sweden will sell the device from Nov. 12. Shares of Nokia added 2.6 percent to 2.05 euros at 4:58 p.m. in Helsinki. They have slumped more than 70 percent since February 2011, when the company said its phones would run Windows. The stock has fallen 46 percent this year, valuing Nokia at 7.67 billion euros. ‘Limited Room’ The new Windows software has yet to win over users and may not be the catalyst Nokia is expecting, Kai Korschelt, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in London , said in a Sept. 6 note. Apple and Google are likely to keep dominating smartphone sales, Korschelt wrote, with Android potentially gaining strength in the lower end of the handset market, which has long been Nokia’s stronghold. That would leave “limited room” for Windows handsets, Korschelt said. And with restructuring costs still to come this year and next, the company’s free cash flow won’t become positive until after 2014, Korschelt said. The sputtering demand for Windows-based phones means Nokia “could well warn for the third quarter, or at least miss expectations,” Pierre Ferragu , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. in London, said in a Sept. 14 note. ‘Fallen Angel’ The most likely outcome is Nokia facing three years of “difficult transition,” serving a niche Windows Phone market and keeping a decent volume of business in low-end phones -- a scenario that would deplete most of its cash, Ferragu said. With Nokia no longer the biggest handset maker, its primary challenge will be to get its debut and spending down to a level that’s more appropriate for a company of its current size, said Arne Eidshagen, who helps manage about 350 million euros in high-yield debt, including Nokia’s, at Alfred Berg Asset Management in Oslo. “The danger with a fallen angel like Nokia.” Eidshagen said, “is that they can’t shrink the balance sheet to meet the new environment.” To contact the reporter on this story: Adam Ewing in Stockholm at  aewing5@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at  kwong11@bloomberg.net",['Adam Ewing'],"Nokia Dividend Elimination Looms as Cash Dwindles CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story on the web mistakenly stated in the headline that Nokia had canceled its dividend.

As Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) depletes its cash pile amid a prolonged turnaround effort, investors are bracing for something that hasn’t happened in decades: no dividends. The unprofitable phonemaker is consuming about $300 million a month, and many investors and bondholders say the company risks running out of funds as it struggles to gain traction for its smartphones, which trail Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and devices using Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android. “Most crucial for Nokia now is to turn around their sales and reach profitability as soon as possible,” said Mikael Anttila, who helps manage corporate bonds, including Nokia debt, at SEB AB in Stockholm. “Until then, it would be rational for them to not pay dividends, to help maintain what cash they have.” Without a dividend, Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop risks alienating yield-focused investors at a time when Nokia’s stock price is headed for its fifth consecutive annual decline. The cash concerns underscore the depth of Nokia’s crisis. The company has paid a dividend every year since at least 1989, which is as far back as its electronic records go. Even the breakup of the Soviet Union , a major buyer of Nokia’s networking gear whose demise spelled financial tumult for the company more than 20 years ago, didn’t prevent it from returning cash to investors. Paper Mill Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland , will probably omit the payout for 2012 after slashing it by more than half over the past four years to 20 cents a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. To maintain the dividend at its current level, Nokia would have to pay about 750 million euros ($964 million) annually out of its dwindling bank account. Doug Dawson , a spokesman for Nokia, declined to comment on dividend plans. The phonemaker typically announces its annual payout when it reports fourth-quarter earnings in January. Founded in 1865 as a pulp and paper mill on the Nokia River, the company expanded into mobile phones in the 1980s and became Europe ’s most valuable corporation at the height of the technology boom. But Nokia was slow to adapt as touchscreen smartphones became the real drivers of the mobile handset market, and its stock has plunged about 90 percent since Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007. The company has announced more than 20,000 job cuts, closed production and research facilities and sold patents and other assets in a bid to become profitable again. Dwindling Cash Nokia lost 2.34 billion euros in the first half and analysts estimate losses will continue at least six more quarters , the average projections compiled by Bloomberg show. Its net cash has shrunk by half in the past five years to 4.2 billion euros at the of June and will drop below 3 billion euros by year-end, Standard & Poor’s predicts. Gross cash at the end of June was 9.4 billion euros. Nokia also has debt of 5.2 billion euros and some repayments are looming. A 1.25 billion-euro bond matures in February 2014, and the company faces repayments in 2016, 2017 and 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A 1.5 billion-euro revolving credit facility could help Nokia shore up its cash reserves. The cost of insuring Nokia bonds using credit-default swaps has almost tripled this year and reached a record of 1,240 basis points on July 18. It added 18 basis points, or 1.9 percent, to 950.58 basis points as of 4:48 p.m. Helsinki time, the biggest intraday jump in three weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Credit-Default Swaps Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. With Nokia’s debt at junk status with the three main rating companies, it should already have suspended dividends, said Sami Sarkamies, a Nordea Bank AB analyst in Helsinki. “It was a mistake not to stop the dividend payment given the weakened outlook,” he said. “This may cost shareholders dearly if Nokia for example needs to pull the plug early on its smartphone revamp due to not being able to afford the costs.” Nokia controlled more than half of global smartphone sales before the first iPhone and Android devices were introduced. Today Nokia’s share in smartphones is about 6.6 percent, according to research firm IDC. IPhone and Android combined make up 85 percent of the market. IPhone Challenge Nokia last year abandoned its home-grown operating system and began using the Windows operating system from Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , where CEO Elop used to work. On Sept. 5, Nokia introduced two new models that run Windows Phone 8, the newest version of the program that Nokia is betting on to lure customers away from Apple and Google. The phones will face off against the iPhone 5, which was unveiled on Sept. 12 and shattered the first-day sales of the previous version. Nokia is set to start rolling out its new Lumia models, with Italian carriers and Sweden ’s largest operator among the first to disclose a debut for the devices. They will be offered in mid-November in Italy by Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , 3 Italia SpA and Wind Telecomunicazioni SpA. The Lumia 920 will be priced at 599 euros and the Lumia 820 at 499 euros in the country. TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) in Sweden will sell the device from Nov. 12. Shares of Nokia added 2.6 percent to 2.05 euros at 4:58 p.m. in Helsinki. They have slumped more than 70 percent since February 2011, when the company said its phones would run Windows. The stock has fallen 46 percent this year, valuing Nokia at 7.67 billion euros. ‘Limited Room’ The new Windows software has yet to win over users and may not be the catalyst Nokia is expecting, Kai Korschelt, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in London , said in a Sept. 6 note. Apple and Google are likely to keep dominating smartphone sales, Korschelt wrote, with Android potentially gaining strength in the lower end of the handset market, which has long been Nokia’s stronghold. That would leave “limited room” for Windows handsets, Korschelt said. And with restructuring costs still to come this year and next, the company’s free cash flow won’t become positive until after 2014, Korschelt said. The sputtering demand for Windows-based phones means Nokia “could well warn for the third quarter, or at least miss expectations,” Pierre Ferragu , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. in London, said in a Sept. 14 note. ‘Fallen Angel’ The most likely outcome is Nokia facing three years of “difficult transition,” serving a niche Windows Phone market and keeping a decent volume of business in low-end phones -- a scenario that would deplete most of its cash, Ferragu said. With Nokia no longer the biggest handset maker, its primary challenge will be to get its debut and spending down to a level that’s more appropriate for a company of its current size, said Arne Eidshagen, who helps manage about 350 million euros in high-yield debt, including Nokia’s, at Alfred Berg Asset Management in Oslo. “The danger with a fallen angel like Nokia.” Eidshagen said, “is that they can’t shrink the balance sheet to meet the new environment.” To contact the reporter on this story: Adam Ewing in Stockholm at  aewing5@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at  kwong11@bloomberg.net",7627,1287,-1
Sprint Primed for Takeovers After Stock Jumps,['Scott Moritz' 'Brooke Sutherl' ''],2012-09-26 20:15:06,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/sprint-primed-for-takeovers-after-stock-jumps-real-m-a.html,"Sprint Nextel Corp.’s (S) stock has more than doubled this year and its cash is near a six-year high, paving the way for an acquisition that could strengthen its efforts to challenge AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Wireless. Sprint’s stock surged 136 percent for the second-biggest gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index as the wireless provider boosted sales with Apple Inc.’s iPhone and began rolling out a faster network. Cash (S) and equivalents stand at almost $6.8 billion after reaching the highest this year since the end of 2005, the year it bought Nextel Communications Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the carrier’s debt exceeds its $16.6 billion market value, the stock gain bolsters its currency for a deal, Gabelli & Co. said. The $36 billion Nextel takeover, intended to create a stronger No. 3 player, instead left Sprint with incompatible networks, fleeing subscribers and five years of losses. With Sprint now showing signs of improvement, Gabelli said the company could expand its customer base by acquiring a smaller rival such as MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) or Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP) A combination with T-Mobile USA, the fourth- biggest provider, would create a carrier with the size to challenge AT&T (T) and Verizon Wireless, Macquarie Group Ltd. said. “When you’re doing a better job and the stock’s reflecting it, there’s a greater willingness to do something and willing sellers on the other side of the transaction,” Zack Shafran, an Overland Park , Kansas-based money manager at Waddell & Reed Financial Inc., which oversees more than $90 billion including Sprint shares, said in a telephone interview. “You have two very large players in the form of AT&T and Verizon and now it’s argued that a strong No. 3 would be a welcomed player. Sprint seems on the verge of perhaps being that strong third player.” Sprint Role Sprint Chief Executive Officer Dan Hesse said in a Sept. 6 interview at the company’s Overland Park headquarters that consolidation “would be constructive” for the industry. “Sprint will play a role in that some way,” Hesse said. Scott Sloat , a Sprint spokesman, declined to comment yesterday on whether the company is currently considering a deal. Sprint is in the second phase of a three-part turnaround under Hesse, who was hired in December 2007 to fix the damage caused by the failed Nextel deal. The past four years were a recovery period during which the company cut staff by a third, moved to wind down the Nextel network and turned its focus to developing a faster network using long-term evolution, or LTE, technology. Spending Stage This year is the first of a two-year spending stage, with the company projecting a return to profitability in 2014. Sprint has a commitment to buy $15.5 billion worth of iPhones and is investing $7 billion to dismantle the Nextel network while building a new one using LTE under a program called Network Vision. Sprint shares had their biggest gain in almost three years on July 26, surging 20 percent after the company reported revenue that exceeded analysts’ estimates on higher iPhone sales. The stock closed at $5.70 on Sept. 24, the highest since June 2011. Today, Sprint shares fell 1.3 percent to $5.46. The company’s cash and equivalents, which dwindled to as low as $2.1 billion in the wake of the Nextel purchase, climbed to a six-year high of $7.6 billion in the first quarter and stood at $6.8 billion as of June 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While more stable now than a year ago, Sprint is still “under-scaled,” said Hesse. On LTE technology, Sprint is at least a year behind Verizon Wireless , the joint venture between Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Vodafone Group Plc. With 32.6 million monthly subscribers as of June 30, it didn’t even have half of No. 2 carrier AT&T’s 69.7 million subscribers , data compiled by Bloomberg show. Verizon Wireless had 88.8 million. Deal Currency With Sprint’s stock soaring, the company has more latitude to increase its customer base by pursuing a takeover, said Sergey Dluzhevskiy, a Rye, New York-based analyst for Gabelli, a unit of Gamco Investors Inc., which oversees about $36 billion and owns Sprint shares. “Sprint’s stock price is key as far as potentially proceeding with a deal,” Dluzhevskiy said in a phone interview. The rally in Sprint shares “obviously helped in terms of currency.” Sprint abandoned plans earlier this year to buy Richardson, Texas-based MetroPCS after the board rejected the transaction, which may have cost as much as $8 billion including debt, two people familiar with the plan said in February. At the time, Sprint’s stock was trading at less than half its value yesterday. ‘Meaningful’ Expansion A revived deal for MetroPCS or a takeover of Leap Wireless (LEAP) would be “meaningful” for Sprint as it strives to expand its presence in the wireless market, according to Gabelli’s Dluzhevskiy. MetroPCS, a $4.2 billion company, would add 9.3 million prepaid subscribers to Sprint’s base, while Leap, a San Diego-based provider with a market value of $531 million, would add 5.9 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. MetroPCS CEO Roger Linquist said during a presentation last week at a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. conference in New York that the company’s position as a relatively small and growing carrier made it the “belle of the ball” in an industry heading for consolidation. Drew Crowell, a MetroPCS spokesman, declined to comment on whether the company had been approached or would consider an offer from Sprint. Gregory Lund, a Leap spokesman, declined to comment on a potential deal with Sprint. Adding Scale Kevin Smithen, a New York-based analyst with Macquarie, said a deal for T-Mobile USA would go further in helping Sprint gain the critical mass needed to take on AT&T and Verizon. T- Mobile, a unit of Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , had 24.1 million contract customers as of June 30, according to its most recent earnings release. “In a perfect world, Sprint would prefer to do a merger with T-Mobile to add scale and spectrum,” which are radio waves for expanded network coverage, Smithen said in a phone interview. “It would give them price leverage, and it could help change the competitive dynamics of the industry.” Jenny Gore, a spokeswoman for Bellevue, Washington-based T- Mobile, declined to comment. While a combination with T-Mobile would make Sprint a stronger competitor, it could draw the same regulatory scrutiny that derailed AT&T’s $39 billion purchase of the carrier last year, said Gabelli’s Dluzhevskiy. He also said T-Mobile’s use of different operating networks means any deal would probably be “a messy integration project.” Heavy Leverage Sprint’s high debt levels -- $21 billion as of June 30 -- could also be a barrier to any deal, according to Scott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer at Concord, New Hampshire-based Granite Investment Advisors Inc., which oversees about $560 million, including Sprint shares. The carrier’s ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was 4.2 as of June 30, compared with leverage of 2.1 times at AT&T (T) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “They clearly can’t add debt onto their balance sheet,” Schermerhorn said in a phone interview. “They’re pretty levered as it is so I’m not sure how you put the whole thing together.” Sprint also may hold off on pursuing an acquisition until it completes work on its network upgrade, said Keith Trauner, a Miami-based money manager at GoodHaven Capital Management LLC, which oversees more than $300 million, including Sprint shares. ‘Transition Period’ “They’re still in this transition period where they’re spending a lot of money to improve and consolidate their network,” Trauner said in a phone interview. “Our hope is that they would finish the network upgrade, fix the balance sheet and make acquisitions, in that order.” Sprint’s Hesse said that while the company is focused on its Network Vision rollout plan, that wouldn’t necessarily preclude the carrier from contemplating a deal. “The preference, from an execution point of view, would be to not undertake more complexity in the Network Vision program until the middle of next year,” Hesse said. “That doesn’t rule out M&A now.” To contact the reporters on this story: Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.net ; Brooke Sutherland in New York at bsutherland7@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: Sarah Rabil at srabil@bloomberg.net ; Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net",['Scott MoritzBrooke Sutherl'],"Sprint Primed for Takeovers After Stock Jumps Sprint Nextel Corp.’s (S) stock has more than doubled this year and its cash is near a six-year high, paving the way for an acquisition that could strengthen its efforts to challenge AT&T Inc.

Lenovo Counting on China Advantage to Challenge Apple Lead: Tech,['Bloomberg News'],2012-09-26 00:32:56,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/lenovo-counting-on-china-advantage-to-challenge-apple-lead-tech.html,"Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , set to overtake Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) as the biggest PC maker this year, now has its sights on the smartphone and tablet markets, as it takes on Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in China. “We want to test the market, see the first steps toward success in China, then roll out to the rest of world,” Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing said. “We want to win in the smartphone area and even the TV area.” The maker of Thinkpad laptops, a business it acquired from IBM, has added tablets and phones to lessen its dependence on PCs, taking it into direct competition with the world’s most valuable company. Yang said Lenovo’s brand name , product development and distribution in China will give it an edge over Apple and other rivals that create devices elsewhere before selling them in the world’s biggest PC and smartphone market. Yang is not alone in that view. A China-first strategy gives Lenovo “the right balance between near-term profitability and long-term growth,” said Masha Gordon, head of emerging- market equity portfolio management at Pacific Investment Management Co. “Lenovo is likely to leverage its global PC footprint to expand its global presence in these new areas.” Lenovo already outsells Apple (AAPL) ’s iPhone in China, where the Beijing-based company introduced its first touch-screen handset in 2010. The company’s smartphone shipments in China outpaced its PC unit sales for the first time in the second quarter, overtaking the iPhone as well, according to researcher IDC. Global Stakes Outside of China, Lenovo will struggle to sell products that are more distinguished by software they can use rather than the device itself, said Jean-Louis Lafayeedney, an analyst at JI Asia in Hong Kong. “I don’t see Lenovo being able to do it, not in the foreseeable future,” said Lafayeedney, who rates the shares sell. He said the company lacks the software development power to lure users away from Apple’s operating system and Samsung, which sells devices based on Google’s Android. Apple introduces its best-selling iPhone and iPad in the U.S. months before they arrive in China. The Cupertino, California-based company has yet to announce a debut date for its latest smartphone model in mainland China, after starting sales of the iPhone 5 Sept. 21 in countries including the U.S., Japan and Hong Kong. The iPhone 5 will be available in China by the end of the year, the company has said. China Smartphones Samsung controlled about 19 percent of China’s smartphone market in the second quarter, the biggest share. Like Lenovo, the South Korean company offers products through all three of China’s largest mobile phone carriers. IPhones aren’t sold to market leader China Mobile Ltd.’s 693 million subscribers, more than the combined populations of the U.S., Japan and Brazil. China will overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest smartphone market this year, with shipments climbing 52 percent to 137 million, according to market researcher IDC. Lenovo is spending 5 billion yuan ($793 million) to set up a plant to research and produce mobile devices, it said in May. The factory will open in October 2013 and will have sales of 10 billion yuan by 2014, quintipling to 50 billion yuan in five years, the company estimates. “Our development cycle will be much faster than our competitors,” said Yang. “Not only are we an innovative company, we understand emerging markets. We have a different strategy.” Price Spectrum Lenovo intends to develop products across the price spectrum, from the latest high-functioning smart TVs to smartphones priced to compete in emerging markets, said Yang. “I don’t think every Chinese can afford $400 to $500 for a smartphone or tablet, but we will develop the appropriate product for those customers. That will be Lenovo’s advantage.” A 16 gigabyte version of the newest iPad with 3G service costs 4,688 yuan at Apple’s online store in China. Lenovo’s ideatab S2007A 16 gigabyte version with 3G service is 2,499 yuan at TMall.com. Yang has also said he intends to use acquisitions to build the global “four screens” business. The maker of the Ideaphone smartphone this month agreed to buy Brazil-based PC, tablet and handset maker Digibras Participacoes SA in a $147 million deal. Lenovo said on Sept. 18 it agreed to buy Stoneware Inc. of the U.S. to gain cloud- computing products in its first acquisition of a software vendor. It didn’t disclose terms. M&A Growth Lenovo spent $845 million in five purchases in 2011, including 466 million euros ($671 million at the time) to take over Essen, Germany-based PC maker Medion AG, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lenovo boosted cash and equivalents an average of 30 percent in the past five quarters to $3.8 billion in the three months ended March 31, in line with Samsung’s 31 percent average gain, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apple’s cash and equivalents dropped an average of 18 percent average across the three quarters, peaking at $1.3 trillion in the three months ended March 26, 2011. Still, buying competitors in emerging markets and spending on research and development may not be enough to allow Lenovo to achieve in the mobile market what it has in PCs, where second- quarter shipments shrank 0.1 percent, according to Gartner Inc. Software Ecosystem Unlike the iPhone and iPad, which operate on Apple’s proprietary software and can access online media through i- Tunes, Lenovo and smartphone leader Samsung run devices on Google’s Android operating system. As more manufacturers compete for tablet sales, control of the operating system will offer an increasing advantage, said Lafayeedney of JI Asia. Companies including Samsung and Lenovo, which mostly depend on Android for mobile devices, will have a more difficult time distinguishing their products, he said. “The edge has to come from control of the ecosystem, or part thereof,” Lafayeedney said in an interview. “That will be the real challenge, in my view. Progression from a pure hardware player will be a most difficult leap to make for Lenovo.” ZTE Corp., China’s second-biggest maker of phone equipment, said Sept. 19 it plans to release a new mobile operating system with the developer of the Firefox web browser to compete with Google Inc.’s Android software. Shenzen, China-based ZTE is expanding in mobile devices and cloud computing where sales growth is faster than its traditional equipment business as the pace of new network rollouts slows. TV Convergence In televisions, where Japan’s former world leaders Sharp Corp., Panasonic Corp. (6752) and Sony Corp. are reeling from losses blamed on a demand slump and the strong yen, Lenovo says it expects to benefit as consumers shift to smart TVs that blur the distinction between television and PC. “We have seen and we will see a lot of convergence,” Yang said by phone from the company’s headquarters in Beijing. “The smartphone is converging with tablet. The tablet is converging with the notebook. The all-in-one desktop is converging with the TV. This will be the trend.” Investors have pushed Lenovo’s shares up 25 percent this year in Hong Kong trading, while analysts see a potential pay off from Yang’s mobile push. The stock is now rated buy by 22 analysts tracked by Bloomberg, compared with three who rate it sell and five hold. The 12-month average price forecast of HK$7.33 for the shares would mean a gain of 14 percent from HK$6.45, yesterday’s price at the close in Hong Kong. U.S. Market Lenovo has yet to set a timeframe for its rise to the “four-screen” top in the U.S., the largest market outside China. “For phones, we have a strong presence in China but we’re not ready for it in North America , and my job is to get us ready,” David Schmoock, Lenovo’s president for North America, said in an interview at his office in Morrisville. “You only get once chance to launch a product and we want to make sure we launch it right.” Lenovo’s timing for entry in the U.S. smartphone and tablet markets underscores the company’s challenges in taking on the likes of Apple and Samsung in the mobile business, said Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein & Co. in Hong Kong “Some people believe Lenovo can take their PC brand and extend it into smartphones, but that’s not their business,” said Moel, who rates Lenovo shares the equivalent of hold. “Lenovo is an incumbent in the PC business, but it’s not even close in handsets. They are going to have to pay for that, spending a long time to get to scale in a business it perhaps shouldn’t be in.” Mobile Move Yang has said remaining primarily a PC maker isn’t an option for the company, given the shift in consumer preference for smartphones and tablets. To that end, Yang established Lenovo’s Mobile Internet Digital Home division last year, which covers the company’s thrust into phones, tablets and televisions. The division in May began selling smart televisions in China that run Google Inc.’s Android 4.0 operating system. The company in August unveiled three new tablets in its Ideatab product line that also run Android 4.0. After one year in operation, the digital home unit reported that sales almost tripled to $587 million during the first fiscal quarter, comprising 7 percent of the company’s total revenue. “Every PC company has to expand its portfolio to smartphones and tablets and, ideally, even smart TVs, because that is the future of devices,” says Kirk Yang , managing director for technology research at Barclays Plc in Hong Kong. “Besides Apple and Samsung, Lenovo is probably the most successful in broadening their product portfolio. Lenovo is getting close to their level.” To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Edmond Lococo in Beijing at  elococo@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Tighe at  mtighe4@bloomberg.net",['Bloomberg News'],"Lenovo Counting on China Advantage to Challenge Apple Lead: Tech Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , set to overtake Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) as the biggest PC maker this year, now has its sights on the smartphone and tablet markets, as it takes on Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in China. “We want to test the market, see the first steps toward success in China, then roll out to the rest of world,” Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing said. “We want to win in the smartphone area and even the TV area.” The maker of Thinkpad laptops, a business it acquired from IBM, has added tablets and phones to lessen its dependence on PCs, taking it into direct competition with the world’s most valuable company. Yang said Lenovo’s brand name , product development and distribution in China will give it an edge over Apple and other rivals that create devices elsewhere before selling them in the world’s biggest PC and smartphone market. Yang is not alone in that view. A China-first strategy gives Lenovo “the right balance between near-term profitability and long-term growth,” said Masha Gordon, head of emerging- market equity portfolio management at Pacific Investment Management Co. “Lenovo is likely to leverage its global PC footprint to expand its global presence in these new areas.” Lenovo already outsells Apple (AAPL) ’s iPhone in China, where the Beijing-based company introduced its first touch-screen handset in 2010. The company’s smartphone shipments in China outpaced its PC unit sales for the first time in the second quarter, overtaking the iPhone as well, according to researcher IDC. Global Stakes Outside of China, Lenovo will struggle to sell products that are more distinguished by software they can use rather than the device itself, said Jean-Louis Lafayeedney, an analyst at JI Asia in Hong Kong. “I don’t see Lenovo being able to do it, not in the foreseeable future,” said Lafayeedney, who rates the shares sell. He said the company lacks the software development power to lure users away from Apple’s operating system and Samsung, which sells devices based on Google’s Android. Apple introduces its best-selling iPhone and iPad in the U.S. months before they arrive in China. The Cupertino, California-based company has yet to announce a debut date for its latest smartphone model in mainland China, after starting sales of the iPhone 5 Sept. 21 in countries including the U.S., Japan and Hong Kong. The iPhone 5 will be available in China by the end of the year, the company has said. China Smartphones Samsung controlled about 19 percent of China’s smartphone market in the second quarter, the biggest share. Like Lenovo, the South Korean company offers products through all three of China’s largest mobile phone carriers. IPhones aren’t sold to market leader China Mobile Ltd.’s 693 million subscribers, more than the combined populations of the U.S., Japan and Brazil. China will overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest smartphone market this year, with shipments climbing 52 percent to 137 million, according to market researcher IDC. Lenovo is spending 5 billion yuan ($793 million) to set up a plant to research and produce mobile devices, it said in May. The factory will open in October 2013 and will have sales of 10 billion yuan by 2014, quintipling to 50 billion yuan in five years, the company estimates. “Our development cycle will be much faster than our competitors,” said Yang. “Not only are we an innovative company, we understand emerging markets. We have a different strategy.” Price Spectrum Lenovo intends to develop products across the price spectrum, from the latest high-functioning smart TVs to smartphones priced to compete in emerging markets, said Yang. “I don’t think every Chinese can afford $400 to $500 for a smartphone or tablet, but we will develop the appropriate product for those customers. That will be Lenovo’s advantage.” A 16 gigabyte version of the newest iPad with 3G service costs 4,688 yuan at Apple’s online store in China. Lenovo’s ideatab S2007A 16 gigabyte version with 3G service is 2,499 yuan at TMall.com. Yang has also said he intends to use acquisitions to build the global “four screens” business. The maker of the Ideaphone smartphone this month agreed to buy Brazil-based PC, tablet and handset maker Digibras Participacoes SA in a $147 million deal. Lenovo said on Sept. 18 it agreed to buy Stoneware Inc. of the U.S. to gain cloud- computing products in its first acquisition of a software vendor. It didn’t disclose terms. M&A Growth Lenovo spent $845 million in five purchases in 2011, including 466 million euros ($671 million at the time) to take over Essen, Germany-based PC maker Medion AG, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lenovo boosted cash and equivalents an average of 30 percent in the past five quarters to $3.8 billion in the three months ended March 31, in line with Samsung’s 31 percent average gain, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apple’s cash and equivalents dropped an average of 18 percent average across the three quarters, peaking at $1.3 trillion in the three months ended March 26, 2011. Still, buying competitors in emerging markets and spending on research and development may not be enough to allow Lenovo to achieve in the mobile market what it has in PCs, where second- quarter shipments shrank 0.1 percent, according to Gartner Inc. Software Ecosystem Unlike the iPhone and iPad, which operate on Apple’s proprietary software and can access online media through i- Tunes, Lenovo and smartphone leader Samsung run devices on Google’s Android operating system. As more manufacturers compete for tablet sales, control of the operating system will offer an increasing advantage, said Lafayeedney of JI Asia. Companies including Samsung and Lenovo, which mostly depend on Android for mobile devices, will have a more difficult time distinguishing their products, he said. “The edge has to come from control of the ecosystem, or part thereof,” Lafayeedney said in an interview. “That will be the real challenge, in my view. Progression from a pure hardware player will be a most difficult leap to make for Lenovo.” ZTE Corp., China’s second-biggest maker of phone equipment, said Sept. 19 it plans to release a new mobile operating system with the developer of the Firefox web browser to compete with Google Inc.’s Android software. Shenzen, China-based ZTE is expanding in mobile devices and cloud computing where sales growth is faster than its traditional equipment business as the pace of new network rollouts slows. TV Convergence In televisions, where Japan’s former world leaders Sharp Corp., Panasonic Corp. (6752) and Sony Corp. are reeling from losses blamed on a demand slump and the strong yen, Lenovo says it expects to benefit as consumers shift to smart TVs that blur the distinction between television and PC. “We have seen and we will see a lot of convergence,” Yang said by phone from the company’s headquarters in Beijing. “The smartphone is converging with tablet. The tablet is converging with the notebook. The all-in-one desktop is converging with the TV. This will be the trend.” Investors have pushed Lenovo’s shares up 25 percent this year in Hong Kong trading, while analysts see a potential pay off from Yang’s mobile push. The stock is now rated buy by 22 analysts tracked by Bloomberg, compared with three who rate it sell and five hold. The 12-month average price forecast of HK$7.33 for the shares would mean a gain of 14 percent from HK$6.45, yesterday’s price at the close in Hong Kong. U.S. Market Lenovo has yet to set a timeframe for its rise to the “four-screen” top in the U.S., the largest market outside China. “For phones, we have a strong presence in China but we’re not ready for it in North America , and my job is to get us ready,” David Schmoock, Lenovo’s president for North America, said in an interview at his office in Morrisville. “You only get once chance to launch a product and we want to make sure we launch it right.” Lenovo’s timing for entry in the U.S. smartphone and tablet markets underscores the company’s challenges in taking on the likes of Apple and Samsung in the mobile business, said Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein & Co. in Hong Kong “Some people believe Lenovo can take their PC brand and extend it into smartphones, but that’s not their business,” said Moel, who rates Lenovo shares the equivalent of hold. “Lenovo is an incumbent in the PC business, but it’s not even close in handsets.

Apple Supplier Jabil Circuit Drops on Margin Challenge,['Ryan Faughnder'],2012-09-26 20:25:59,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/apple-supplier-jabil-circuit-drops-on-margin-challenge.html,"Jabil Circuit Inc. (JBL) fell the most in more than a year after reporting profit that missed analysts’ estimates, a sign that higher spending to manufacture casings for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone 5 is crimping margins. Shares of the St. Petersburg , Florida-based electronics supplier declined 9.9 percent to $18.90 at the close in New York , for the biggest decrease since August 2011. The stock has lost 3.9 percent this year. Apple is one of Jabil Circuit’s biggest customers, generating at least 10 percent of sales for the 2012 fiscal year, which ended in August. The business unit making the iPhone casings accounted for 70 percent of $481 million in capital expenditures for the year, with about $202 million of the outlay occurring in the fourth quarter. “These guys are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to meet Apple’s supply needs for the iPhone in a very narrow window,” Thomas Dinges, an analyst at IHS ISuppli, said in a telephone interview today. “Most of it is in machining, hiring and R&D.” Profit excluding some costs was 54 cents in the fourth quarter, trailing analysts’ average estimate by 4 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “Results from the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by a challenging new program ramp,” Chief Executive Officer Timothy Main said in a statement yesterday. Beth Walters, a spokeswoman for Jabil Circuit, and Natalie Harrison , a spokeswoman for Apple, didn’t return calls seeking comment on Jabil Circuit’s role in manufacturing the iPhone 5. ‘Segment Underperformance’ Net income for the period fell 28 percent to $82.8 million, or 39 cents a share, from $114.3 million, or 52 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.4 percent to $4.34 billion, topping analysts’s average $4.22 billion estimate. The diversified manufacturing services unit, which includes the iPhone casings business, contributed about 45 percent of sales in the period, or approximately $1.9 billion, the company said during a conference call yesterday. That was less than analysts had expected, James Kelleher , an analyst at Argus Research, wrote in a research report today. “The disappointment in the diversified manufacturing services segment reflected underperformance in a large, complex new product ramp,” Kelleher said. “Although Jabil was tight- lipped, this operation may have been providing casings for the iPhone 5 ramp.” For the 2013 fiscal year, Jabil Circuit expects to have “one 10 percent customer,” the company said during the conference call. That client is Apple, Sean Hannan, an analyst at Needham & Co., said in an interview today. ‘Aluminum Casing’ “Jabil has efficiency issues with the continued sharp ramp-up of the iPhone 5 production,” Hannan said. “Most suspect that Jabil is one of the important suppliers of the aluminum casing.” Profit excluding some items for the fiscal first quarter, which ends in November, will be 51 cents to 62 cents a share, Jabil Circuit said. That fell short of analysts’ average 67 cent estimate. Besides Apple, Jabil Circuit got at least 10 percent of sales from two other customers in fiscal 2012, Cisco Systems Inc. and Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , the components maker said during the conference call.

"Samsung Sees Stronger Start for Note 2, Unfazed by iPhone",['Jun Yang'],2012-09-26 04:08:53,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/samsung-sees-stronger-start-for-note-2-unfazed-by-iphone.html,"Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) expects sales of its new Galaxy Note 2 smartphone to get off to a stronger start than its predecessor even after Apple Inc. (AAPL) sold a record number of the latest iPhone in its debut weekend. The model will probably sell three times faster than the previous Note did in the first three months, as more carriers are set to offer the product, J.K. Shin, head of the mobile business , said at a briefing in Seoul , without giving a projection. The device goes on sale in 128 markets through 260 operators, starting with South Korea today, the Suwon, South Korea-based company said in a statement. Samsung, the world’s largest mobile-phone seller, is offering a variety of Galaxy devices running Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system to cement leadership in the global smartphone market. More than 5 million iPhone 5 handsets were sold in the first three days, surpassing a record set last year by the previous model, Apple said on Sept. 24. Samsung is marketing the pen-equipped Note devices alongside its best-selling Galaxy S smartphones after the first model sold more than 10 million units and helped Samsung regain the lead in global smartphone sales from Apple this year. Samsung first unveiled the Galaxy Note 2 at the IFA consumer-electronics fair in Berlin last month. The model has a 5.5-inch screen, larger than its predecessor, and runs the latest version of Android. The device is loaded with software that recognizes handwriting from a digital pen. Digital Pen The updated digital pen will allow consumers to hover over the screen to preview content and will be available for third- party applications. In the second quarter, Samsung controlled about 35 percent of the global smartphone market, followed by Apple with about 18 percent, according to market researcher Strategy Analytics. Samsung is introducing new devices as a patent dispute with Apple deepens. Apple won more than $1 billion in damages Aug. 24 after a jury found the South Korean company infringed six of seven patents at stake in the trial. In that case, the iPhone maker seeks a U.S. ban on eight Samsung smartphone models and a tablet computer. In a separate lawsuit, Apple has added the Galaxy S III to a list of products it says infringe its patents.

Foxconn Workers Labor Under Guard After Riot Shuts Plant,['Bloomberg News'],2012-09-27 01:56:07,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/foxconn-workers-labor-under-police-watch-after-riot-shuts-plant.html,"Security teams wearing riot helmets and wielding plastic shields marched around a Foxconn Technology Group factory in northern China in a sign that tensions remain high after a fight between 2,000 workers halted production. Foxconn’s complex, home to 79,000 workers in Taiyuan, Shanxi province, still shows damage caused by a Sept. 23 clash in which a dormitory fight escalated into a riot finally quelled by hundreds of security guards and police. More than 40 people were hospitalized in the melee that left shattered windows and damaged parked cars across the campus. Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou has moved to improve conditions at his factories in recent years, after a spate of suicides and pressure from the company’s largest customer, Apple Inc. (AAPL) The unrest underscores the social strains of a Chinese export- manufacturing model where thousands of workers, mostly young, work long hours in military-style conditions, sleeping in dormitories and surrounded by security guards. “The guards here use gangster style to manage,” Fang Zhongyang, 23, said outside campus gates. “We are not against following rules but you have to tell us why. They won’t explain things and we feel like we cannot communicate with them.” Fang, from nearby Henan province , has worked at Foxconn for two years. He started in Shenzhen, the company’s biggest facility, making Apple iPhones and moved to Taiyuan four months ago after being told that Foxconn wasn’t going to make those products there anymore. ‘Fierce’ Guards One guard, a young woman, yelled at a reporter for interviewing workers near the southern gate and told employees to get back inside. She ordered the reporter to go across the street, saying the space outside the gate was Foxconn property. “They are quite formidable,” said Gao Bo, 25, who has worked there for six months. “They watch quite closely and speak fiercely.” As he spoke, platoons in green uniforms kept formation inside the campus. Louis Woo, a spokesman for the Taipei-based company, said he was unaware of the accusations against the guards. “If there’s any truth to these allegations, we’ll take severe action against any security guards, even though we don’t hire them directly,” Woo said by phone yesterday. Foxconn isn’t hiring more security, yet it has asked government officials to help monitor the situation. Woo declined to say what products were made at the Taiyuan factory. The employees interviewed said they made small components. Poorly Trained Gou agreed with a management decision to shut production for a day after the Sept. 23 fight, the company said. Foxconn said it expected limited impact on production. Workers said the fight started in a dormitory and escalated when guards employed by independent contractors responded with excessive force. Such tension is typical in China, said Geoffrey Crothall , a director at rights group China Labor Bulletin. “Factory workers anywhere, beyond Foxconn, never have a good word to say about security guards,” Crothall said yesterday. “Their training is minimal, they’re recruited en masse and the requirements are not much.” Woo declined to comment on the level of training for the guards. Foxconn employs more than 1.2 million workers in at least 18 countries, including China, Brazil , Taiwan , Vietnam and Mexico. It is the primary supplier of Apple’s iPad and iPhone, Sony Corp. (6758) ’s PlayStation game console and TVs, and Nintendo Co.’s Wii console. Bad Food, Dirty Bathrooms The average worker at the Taiyuan plant is 20 years old, with 65 percent being male and 77 percent coming from local Shanxi province, according to a company official, who declined to be identified because of the police investigation. That’s three years younger than the average worker at Foxconn’s Shenzhen factories producing Apple products, according to a March report from the Fair Labor Association, which audited the company’s working conditions. Foxconn in August raised salaries by more than 16 percent at a Zhengzhou factory making iPhones and halved the probation period for new workers after the FLA said the company was ahead of schedule in improving conditions. Work hours exceeded targets and legal mandates, the FLA said. Taiyuan workers start at a monthly salary of 1,800 yuan ($286) and can get a 200-yuan raise after three months. They also get bonuses during Chinese New Year, after six months on the job and after a year. Employees can work as much as 36 hours of overtime a month, the company official said yesterday. Employees outside the factory said the pay was good, though their living conditions were not. The food was of low quality, dorm rooms had four bunk beds for eight people, and the shared bathrooms weren’t clean. “The dormitories are too crowded,” said a 24-year-old worker identifying himself as Wang. “I don’t sleep well because it’s noisy.

The phones would include keyboard and touch-screen models in each category, expanding beyond the high-end Z10 and Q10 models it has already announced, the wire service said today, citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins. While lower-priced models using BlackBerry 10 would be designed for markets such as India and Indonesia , other countries will still get new models using the earlier BlackBerry 7 system, the wire service said. The plan will help the Canadian smartphone maker compete against Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. as they develop products for similar markets, the report said. Heins also said he was skeptical of the idea of selling BlackBerry’s hardware business to become only a service provider, according to the Canadian Press. “BlackBerry is an end-to-end solution,” he told the wire service.

"Next Facebook May Be Chinese as Sites Innovate, Not Copy",['Edmond Lococo'],2013-03-29 08:37:46,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-29/next-facebook-may-be-chinese-as-sites-innovate-not-copy-1-.html,"Instagram, the photo-sharing app bought by Facebook Inc. (FB) last year, offers special effects that can give pictures a weathered black-and-white cast or retro tints. In Beijing, Xu Chaojun’s PaPa app does that, too. In addition, it lets users attach voice messages that can sound like robots or cats. PaPa notched 10 million downloads in five months from iPhone and Android users and the company released an English-language version, Wave , on Apple Inc. (AAP) ’s iTunes on March 10. Chinese Internet companies, such as Alibaba.com Ltd. (1688) , have been dismissed as imitators of successful U.S. enterprises like EBay Inc (EBAY) (EBAY). Some have been content to profit from their vast home market. Yet Xu’s firm and others aim to compete globally and many Chinese entrepreneurs are improving on the Western products that inspired them, said Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s China operation and founder of venture capital fund Innovation Works. “Innovation, if it’s defined as inventing the light bulb, might still be a stretch for China,” said Lee, who helped fund PaPa. “To be the first to conceive of the next iPhone may be still a little difficult, but the prospect of making a Facebook, a Twitter or an Instagram, I think that is now, for the first time ever, within reach for the Chinese startup.” Success Stories The companies Lee says are closest to that kind of success -- two years away, he predicts -- aren’t exactly startups. He points to WeChat, an instant-message app with 300 million users that’s owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) (700), and Weibo, a Twitter-like microblog with more than 500 million registered accounts, run by Sina Corp. (SINA) Tencent is China ’s largest Internet company by market value, and Sina is listed on the Nasdaq. China’s early Internet companies like Alibaba learned “a lot” from western companies like EBay, Lee said. Alibaba didn’t simply copy any foreign model and came up with its own solutions like payment escrow services to address a lack of consumer credit cards in China, said John Spelich, an Alibaba spokesman. Innovation Works, founded in September 2009, manages $500 million in assets, including funding from YouTube co-founder Steve Chen and Foxconn Technology Group. The fund is based in the Zhongguancun district of northwestern Beijing, China’s equivalent of Silicon Valley. So far, Lee’s invested in roughly 50 companies, with a goal of five success stories a year. While Instagram is available in the country, through app stores including China Mobile Ltd (941) .’s Mobile Market, Facebook isn’t. The Menlo Park, California-based social network, along with Twitter and Google Inc (GOOG) .’s YouTube, are censored and blocked from local users. Instagram hasn’t caught on in China because it was missing a key ingredient for local tastes, which was voice, said PaPa’s Xu. ‘Crowded Environment’ “Chinese people like to use their voices,” Xu said. “You go to a Chinese restaurant and it’s very noisy. You go to an American restaurant and it’s very quiet. We live in a crowded environment so we are used to noise. We like noise.” Intel Corp (INTC) .’s venture fund, Intel Capital , has invested about $670 million in more than 100 Chinese technology companies since 1998. Richard Hsu, managing director of Intel Capital China, said many of the roughly 40 companies in his portfolio have had to develop new business models to succeed. Shanghai-based Uucun , which helps set up and run app stores for more than 300 smartphone makers, gives away its products, making money from ads and promotions embedded in the apps. The ads reach 30 million users and the company has attracted more than $10 million in investment from firms including Intel Capital and Vickers Capital, Uucun Chief Executive Officer Zhang Zhendong said. Financing Access China added 51 million Internet users last year, bringing its total to 564 million. In a speech on March 4, President Xi Jinping urged “boosting innovation-powered development in order to make China an economic heavyweight.” Yet censorship by the government hampers entrepreneurs and keeps China from taking “its rightful place in terms of innovation,” said Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA China, a technology consulting company. Another problem: reduced access to financing abroad. The number of Chinese initial public offerings in the U.S. last year declined to three, less than one-tenth the peak in 2010, as allegations of accounting fraud weakened investor demand. Still, China has become “a fast-paced entrepreneurial launchpad,” Clark said. PaPa’s Xu, 33, said he and Li Xiaobao, 24, finished the first version of their photo- and audio-sharer a month after conception. Xu estimated that PaPa will hit 50 million users this year and 200 million within three years. That would outpace Instagram, which reached 100 million users in February, almost two and a half years after its introduction. PaPa, a 30-employee company based in a reclaimed Mao-era factory, has raised more than $10 million from firms including Innovation Works and Sequoia Capital. It’s already sold its first paid advertisements and Xu said it’ll do even better once he hires a sales team. Yet he’s resisting urges to attempt an IPO. “PaPa now is only at the start of our ambition,” he said.

Chinese Police Detain Distributor in Hero Milk Powder Probe,['Bloomberg News'],2013-03-29 22:00:00,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-29/shanghai-pulls-swiss-brand-s-milk-in-crackdown-after-apple-vw.html,"Chinese police detained a milk distributor suspected of repackaging and selling milk powder made by Swiss dairy company Hero Group that wasn’t licensed for sale domestically, the official Xinhua News Agency said. The suspect was in charge of a Suzhou, eastern China-based company distributing Hero-branded products, Xinhua said yesterday. Of the 17 batches of milk powder confiscated from the distributor, only three were qualified for sale in China , the agency said, without being more specific. Shanghai had asked 15 supermarkets and 28 stores selling Hero’s Nutradefense formula to remove the products after the state television broadcaster reported food quality problems, the city’s food safety commission said in a statement March 28. Lenzburg, Switzerland-based Hero said in a statement on its website yesterday it hasn’t detected any quality or safety problems with its products. Hero’s experience mirrors incidents that affected other overseas brands as China strengthens scrutiny on foreign companies ranging from iPhone maker Apple Inc. (AAPL) to Volkswagen AG. (VOW) New leadership takes over this month in a once-in-a-decade change and Premier Li Keqiang pledged on March 17 to improve consumer safety by regulating food quality and environmental protection with an “iron fist.” Yum, Audi Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) Vice Chairman Sam Su earlier this year apologized after Shanghai’s food safety commission found excessive levels of antibiotics in samples from a local chicken supplier between 2010 and 2011. Inspection processes and internal communications were lacking, said Su, who’s also chairman of the Louisville, Kentucky-based restaurant chain’s China business. Last year, Volkswagen’s luxury Audi unit asked a Chinese dealer to remove a banner advocating the murder of Japanese people after a photograph of the sign spread on the Internet amid escalating tensions between the two countries over disputed islands. The message didn’t reflect Audi’s views, Lu Minjie, a spokeswoman at FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Co. said in September. The Shanghai Food and Drug Administration is conducting a “through investigation” into Hero’s milk powder, the agency said in the statement on its website dated March 28. Any offenders would be “severely dealt with,” it said. Netherlands Made Hero said its infant formula sold in China is produced exclusively in the Netherlands and it hasn’t detected quality or safety violations. CCTV in a March 29 report said samples of Hero’s Nutradefense branded formula had altered expiration dates and were adulterated with expired milk. Hero Nutradefense infant formula is suitable for babies between 6 months to 3 years old, and it sells other infant nutrition brands such as Hero Baby, Friso, and Semper, globally, according to the company’s website. The Swiss dairy company said in the statement a recent investigation by the Suzhou Institute of Supervision & Inspection on Product Quality alleged that one of Hero’s sub- distributors in China had been involved in the illegal repackaging of Nutradefense. This has been investigated by Suzhou authorities and dealt with appropriately, it said. Apple and Volkswagen were featured in government-run China Central Television ’s annual consumer rights show in the country on March 15. Apple Criticism Apple has also come under criticism in China since CCTV’s annual consumer rights telecast two weeks ago found issues related to its after-sales service. The People’s Daily, a newspaper published by China’s Communist Party, has run articles critical of Apple every day this week. In yesterday’s People’s Daily, the newspaper said the State Administration for Industry and Commerce urged strengthening regulation of contracts between consumers and electronics makers. Apple policies on returns and repairs in China “fully comply with the local laws and regulations,” according to a Chinese-language statement that the company posted to consumers on its website last weekend. Volkswagen, Europe ’s largest automaker, said March 16 it plans to recall vehicles in China after drawing scrutiny from the nation’s quality inspector and state broadcaster over defective gearbox systems. Chinese owners of Volkswagen vehicles fitted with its direct-shift gearbox technology -- a system with two gearboxes that help enhance gear changes and improve fuel economy -- have reported abnormal vibrations, loss of power and sudden acceleration, according to CCTV’s report.

Barnes & Noble Breakup Seen Unlocking 44% Gain: Real M&A,['Chelsey Dulaney'],2013-07-19 13:57:12,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/barnes-noble-breakup-seen-unlocking-44-gain-real-m-a.html,"A breakup of Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS) that could boost the bookseller’s value by 44 percent may finally be in the cards. The largest U.S. bookstore chain last week reinforced speculation that a breakup is probable after its chief executive officer resigned. Michael Huseby, who helped oversee spinoffs at Cablevision Systems Corp., was promoted to president of the $1.1 billion company. Short sellers have reduced bets that the shares will fall, possibly in anticipation of a value-boosting split, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC said. If separated, Barnes & Noble’s three businesses -- the retail chain, college bookstores and Nook digital business -- should be valued at a combined $25.86 a share compared with yesterday’s close of $17.97, according to the average of four analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Leonard Riggio, the chairman and biggest shareholder, says he wants to buy the retail chain. Nook shareholder Microsoft (MSFT) Corp. may want the rest of the unit to keep up with Apple Inc., Maxim Group LLC said. Janney sees Google (GOOG) Inc. as a suitor. “They need to do something sooner rather than later,” Steven Soranno, a Bethesda, Maryland-based analyst at Calvert Investments Inc., which oversees more than $12 billion and owned Barnes & Noble shares as of June 30, said in a phone interview. “For shareholders, there is a sense of urgency. If they can realize good value from making that right sale, I think that’s better for shareholders.” Shareholder Pain Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for New York-based Barnes & Noble, declined to comment on the company’s plans. Today, Barnes & Noble shares rose 0.5 percent to $18.05 at 9:53 a.m. in New York. Shareholders of Barnes & Noble have endured years of pain, with the stock down 62 percent through yesterday from an all-time high of $47.40 in 2006, as online book sales and the success of Amazon.com Inc.’s Kindle e-reader and Apple’s iPad squeezed profits. The same pressure put Borders Group Inc. out of business in 2011. Barnes & Noble CEO William Lynch quit on July 8 after the company posted three straight annual net losses. When he won the job in 2010, Lynch told Bloomberg News that his appointment showed how important the bookseller’s new focus on digital technology was. This effort has been largely unsuccessful, and Lynch leaving suggests a shift away from that area, said Michael Souers , a New York-based equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ. The resignation of Lynch, who isn’t being replaced, spurred a 5.4 percent rally in Barnes & Noble’s shares on July 9. That’s a sign investors are optimistic the company will break up, said Los Angeles-based Andrew Berkin, whose $76 million Vericimetry U.S. Small Cap Value Fund owned the retailer’s shares as of March 31. Unlocking Value Albert Saporta, the head of research at Makor Capital Ltd. and a managing director at AIM&R, said taking the retail unit unit private and selling off the Nook e-book business is the best way to unlock value at Barnes & Noble. The digital division posted an operating loss of $200 million for the quarter that ended in January, versus earnings of $177 million and $22 million at the retail and college units, respectively. “The share price does not reflect the real value of the retail business,” he said in a phone interview from Tel Aviv. Barnes & Noble’s divisions could fetch $25.86 a share in total if separated, according to the average sum-of-the-parts estimate from four analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The estimate from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Matthew Fassler using multiples from prior deals is $19.42. Janney’s David Strasser sees about $20, and Maxim Group’s John Tinker said about $30. The midpoint of the $30-to-$38 range from Albert Fried & Co.’s Sachin Shah is $34. Chairman’s Interest Riggio, who acquired the Barnes & Noble brand and flagship Manhattan bookstore in the 1970s, said in February that he plans to offer to purchase the retail chain, which comprises about 675 stores, and related website. The price would be negotiated with the board, and the buyout would be funded primarily with cash, Riggio said Feb. 25 in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As part of the management change announced July 8, Huseby and Mitchell Klipper, the head of the retail chain, report directly to Riggio. To finish a deal, Riggio could partner with John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA) , which bought a Barnes & Noble stake in 2011, or partner with other investors, S&P’s Souers said. In 2012, Barnes & Noble created a subsidiary, Nook Media, that included the Nook and college bookstores. Microsoft took a stake in the business and Pearson Plc followed later. Microsoft, Pearson Calvert’s Soranno said Microsoft might want Nook Media. Maxim Group’s Tinker sees Pearson as a possible suitor for the college stores. Even Google might be interested in all of Nook Media, said Janney’s Strasser. Representatives for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, London-based Pearson, and Mountain View, California-based Google declined to comment. In June, Barnes & Noble said it would stop making Nook hardware and look for a manufacturing partner. That unit could help Microsoft bulk up its consumer segment, said Tinker, the New York-based analyst at Maxim Group. The segment that runs bookstores on college campuses and sells digital textbooks could appeal to Pearson (PSON) , an academic publisher, he added. For Microsoft, “they’ve obviously been experimenting with this type of retail strategy, and they need to figure out if they’re going to copy Apple properly or not,” Tinker said. For Pearson, “you’ve got these college bookstores that could be very valuable as a conduit into universities,” he said. Short Sellers A plunge in bets the stock will fall may also indicate changes are ahead for Barnes & Noble. The proportion of shares sold short dropped to a five-year low of 3.7 percent as of June 21 from 2013’s peak of 22 percent in February, according to data compiled by Markit. The figure was 6.2 percent on July 16. “Fear is out there” among short sellers, Strasser, the Janney analyst, said in a phone interview. “I’ve always been a believer that there’s the potential for at least one transaction to come at any time.” To contact the reporter on this story: Chelsey Dulaney in New York at  cdulaney@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Sarah Rabil at  srabil@bloomberg.net",['Chelsey Dulaney'],"Barnes & Noble Breakup Seen Unlocking 44% Gain: Real M&A A breakup of Barnes & Noble Inc.

The estimate from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Matthew Fassler using multiples from prior deals is $19.42. Janney’s David Strasser sees about $20, and Maxim Group’s John Tinker said about $30. The midpoint of the $30-to-$38 range from Albert Fried & Co.’s Sachin Shah is $34. Chairman’s Interest Riggio, who acquired the Barnes & Noble brand and flagship Manhattan bookstore in the 1970s, said in February that he plans to offer to purchase the retail chain, which comprises about 675 stores, and related website. The price would be negotiated with the board, and the buyout would be funded primarily with cash, Riggio said Feb. 25 in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As part of the management change announced July 8, Huseby and Mitchell Klipper, the head of the retail chain, report directly to Riggio. To finish a deal, Riggio could partner with John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA) , which bought a Barnes & Noble stake in 2011, or partner with other investors, S&P’s Souers said. In 2012, Barnes & Noble created a subsidiary, Nook Media, that included the Nook and college bookstores. Microsoft took a stake in the business and Pearson Plc followed later. Microsoft, Pearson Calvert’s Soranno said Microsoft might want Nook Media. Maxim Group’s Tinker sees Pearson as a possible suitor for the college stores. Even Google might be interested in all of Nook Media, said Janney’s Strasser. Representatives for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, London-based Pearson, and Mountain View, California-based Google declined to comment. In June, Barnes & Noble said it would stop making Nook hardware and look for a manufacturing partner. That unit could help Microsoft bulk up its consumer segment, said Tinker, the New York-based analyst at Maxim Group. The segment that runs bookstores on college campuses and sells digital textbooks could appeal to Pearson (PSON) , an academic publisher, he added. For Microsoft, “they’ve obviously been experimenting with this type of retail strategy, and they need to figure out if they’re going to copy Apple properly or not,” Tinker said. For Pearson, “you’ve got these college bookstores that could be very valuable as a conduit into universities,” he said. Short Sellers A plunge in bets the stock will fall may also indicate changes are ahead for Barnes & Noble. The proportion of shares sold short dropped to a five-year low of 3.7 percent as of June 21 from 2013’s peak of 22 percent in February, according to data compiled by Markit. The figure was 6.2 percent on July 16. “Fear is out there” among short sellers, Strasser, the Janney analyst, said in a phone interview. “I’ve always been a believer that there’s the potential for at least one transaction to come at any time.” To contact the reporter on this story: Chelsey Dulaney in New York at  cdulaney@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Sarah Rabil at  srabil@bloomberg.net",6471,1066,0
NSA Puts Limits on Systems Staff in Wake of Snowden Leaks,['Terry Atlas'],2013-07-19 04:26:52,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/nsa-puts-limits-on-systems-staff-in-wake-of-snowden-leaks.html,"The U.S. National Security Agency is imposing new restrictions on systems administrators and other personnel following “irreversible damage” caused by fugitive former contractor Edward Snowden, the NSA director said. Without providing details, Army General Keith Alexander said he has seen signs that Snowden’s exposure of classified surveillance programs hurt U.S. intelligence efforts and made it harder for the government to thwart terrorist plots. Morale at the NSA, a Defense Department agency responsible for communications intelligence, has also been undermined by Snowden’s disclosures and the public controversy that followed, Alexander said. He praised the agency’s workforce and cited 20 NSA code-breakers who died in Afghanistan and Iraq. “These are the heroes, not this leaker,” he said at the Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colorado. Alexander’s comments yesterday marked his latest effort to defend U.S. surveillance activities after Snowden’s leaks exposed top-secret NSA collection of telephone and Internet data. The revelations last month sparked an international controversy and stirred calls among members of Congress and privacy-rights advocates for the programs to be curtailed. During an earlier panel discussion at the forum, Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union , credited Snowden for igniting a much-needed public discussion about the reach of U.S. surveillance. “He did this country a service by starting a debate that was anemic, that was left to government officials when people did not understand fully what was happening,” Romero said. “Regardless of where you come out on it, we have now a vigorous public debate.” Plots Disrupted Alexander said it was unfortunate that much of the initial information that emerged on the once-secret programs was wrong or incomplete. He reiterated that the activities were authorized by U.S. law and subject to judicial and congressional oversight, points that he said weren’t made clear to the public. The NSA director said the programs exposed by Snowden played a role in breaking up terrorist plots and identifying people connected to terrorist groups without any major compromise in Americans’ privacy rights. Last month, Alexander told U.S. lawmakers that the surveillance activities disrupted more than 50 terrorist conspiracies worldwide. Earlier at the conference, the director of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, Matthew Olsen, said the Snowden leaks have benefited terrorist organizers. “We have seen, in response to the Snowden leaks, al-Qaeda and affiliated groups seeking to change their tactics, looking to see what they can learn from what is in the press and seek to change how they communicate to avoid detection,” Olsen said. ‘Taking Action’ Alexander said the NSA has determined which files Snowden took and said they amounted to a lot of information, though he wouldn’t say how much. “We’re taking action to fix this” so it can’t happen again, said Alexander, who was interviewed on stage at the forum by Pete Williams of NBC News. The new security measures include restricting the use of removable media, such as thumb drives, by systems administrators to move data among network servers, Alexander said. U.S. officials have said that Snowden used a thumb drive to copy the documents he took. Alexander outlined other steps, including requiring two people to execute some activities, such as gaining access to server rooms, and speeding programs to encrypt files to make them readable only to authorized users. Phone Companies Alexander said the NSA and Congress are also weighing proposals to shift responsibility for maintaining so-called metadata on phone calls to telecommunications companies from the NSA under a court-mandated process that would ensure ther government has access when necessary. That might be done in response to public concerns about the government keeping the data itself, he said. The NSA set up that database to save information such as telephone numbers and duration of conversations -- not content of calls -- after the companies in 2009 rejected a government request that they do it, according to former Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair. Alexander said President Barack Obama ’s administration is also considering a request from a coalition of companies, privacy advocates and trade groups to let Internet and phone carriers publish the number and types of U.S. data requests they receive. He said the response depends on whether that can be done without risking damage to investigations. The 63 organizations that made the request in a letter yesterday included Google Inc. (GOOG) , Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. (AAPL) ; the Center for Democracy and Technology, a non-profit privacy advocate; and trade groups the Computer and Communications Industry Association and the Internet Association. Espionage Charges Amid the U.S. debate over surveillance, Snowden remains holed up in a Moscow airport as he pursues requests for asylum. The 30-year-old former employee of McLean, Virginia-based government contractor Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp. (BAH) faces federal charges including espionage. The U.S. is pressing Russia to expel Snowden and has revoked his passport. He applied for temporary asylum this week at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport and has been confined to the transit area there since arriving from Hong Kong on June 23. While Venezuela, Nicaragua and Bolivia have indicated they’d be willing to take him in, Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the U.S. of stranding Snowden in Moscow by pressuring other countries to prevent his travel through their airspace and to deny him refuge. The standoff has cast a shadow on preparations for a summit in early September between Putin and Obama. ‘Bad Message’ Romero said the ACLU hasn’t decided whether it would be willing to aid in Snowden’s legal defense if he were to return for to the U.S. for trial. He criticized White House spokesman Jay Carney for saying that Snowden isn’t a human-rights activist or whistle-blower. “Well, who made him king of the human-rights community?” Romero said of Carney. Another panelist, Jeh Charles Johnson , a former Defense Department general counsel, said, “It is a bad message to send to people who decide to take the law into their own hands that they are doing a public service.” Former U.S. Representative Jane Harman said Snowden shouldn’t be viewed in the same category as national-security whistle-blowers such as Daniel Ellsberg , who made public the Pentagon papers about the Vietnam War. “This is completely different from Ellsberg,” said Harman, a California Democrat who headed the House intelligence committee. “This is a kid who had nothing to do with formulating the policy; for my lights is totally self-centered and narcissistic.” To contact the reporter on this story: Terry Atlas in Washington at  tatlas@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: John Walcott at  jwalcott9@bloomberg.net",['Terry Atlas'],"NSA Puts Limits on Systems Staff in Wake of Snowden Leaks The U.S. National Security Agency is imposing new restrictions on systems administrators and other personnel following “irreversible damage” caused by fugitive former contractor Edward Snowden, the NSA director said.

ModCloth’s Vintage Threads Lift Sales Past $100 Million,['Douglas Mac Millan'],2013-07-19 19:44:41,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/modcloth-s-vintage-threads-lift-sales-past-100-million.html,"For Eric and Susan Koger, the husband-and-wife duo who founded online shopping site ModCloth Inc. as high school sweethearts, a division of labor has always been clear: he’s tech and she’s fashion. That balance helped ModCloth stand out in a sea of e-commerce rivals and expand sales to “well over” $100 million last year, according to Chief Executive Officer Eric Koger, 29. It also informed a push into wireless devices, which now account for nearly half of visits to its store, he said. “What really sets us apart is this marriage of art and science, left brain and right brain,” said Susan, 28, the chief creative officer. E-commerce companies “don’t really get the fashion” and the world’s top clothing designers “don’t have that analytical background” to compete online, she said. ModCloth and upstart e-retailers Fab.com Inc., Zulily Inc. and The Fancy, are vying for shoppers in the $186.2 billion U.S. online commerce market dominated by Amazon.com Inc. Led by the Kogers, ModCloth is focused on the mobile-buying experience, turning smartphones into vintage clothing boutiques and using customer feedback to decide which items to stock. Sales will increase by over 40 percent this year, Eric Koger said in the interview, the first time he’s publicly revealed details about ModCloth’s 2012 revenue and growth rate. He declined to say whether the company is profitable. Amazon Investments E-commerce has traditionally been a challenging market for startups, because Amazon invests heavily in new businesses at the expense of profitability. The Seattle-based company also has close to $8 billion in cash and marketable securities. Still, most purchases happen offline, so ModCloth and others are betting there are plenty of opportunities for growth. In the first quarter, e-commerce accounted for 5.5 percent of total U.S. retail sales , up from 4.9 percent a year earlier, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Started in 2002 -- the year Eric and Susan left their hometown in southern Florida to attend Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh -- ModCloth has become a top shopping site for women. It buys dresses and other female apparel from designers, stores the items in its Pittsburgh fulfillment center and promotes them online using whimsical names like “Olive Your Dress” and “Sailor Swift Skirt.” Data collected from users on its website and social networks such as Pinterest Inc. help ModCloth decide which items to keep in stock and which ones to abandon. Its “Be the Buyer” program, started in 2009, encourages users to give detailed feedback on newer pieces offered in the store, which designers may then incorporate into future products. User Feedback “A customer might be saying, ‘I like the print, but I don’t feel like the silhouette is flattering,’” said Trisha Kiblinger, a national sales manager at Tulle, which has sold goods on ModCloth since 2007. The fashion label adjusts designs based on feedback from ModCloth users, Kiblinger said. Customers increasingly view, rate and buy products using mobile devices, which account for 42 percent of visits to ModCloth, up from 27 percent at the beginning of 2013, Eric Koger said. This year, the company released apps for Apple Inc.’s iPhone and iPad, and saw higher spending per purchase on tablets than on desktop computers. While the CEO declined to discuss ModCloth’s profitability, he said margins are comparable to those of Asos Plc (ASC) , the U.K.’s largest fashion-only retailer. The London-based website’s gross margin last year was about 50 percent. IPO Alternative ModCloth investors including Accel Partners , First Round Capital and Norwest Venture Partners , have put $40 million into ModCloth. Norwest led the most recent financing round last May, helping the company put off a potential initial public offering while it focuses on growth. “We’re going to deliver liquidity to them eventually, but we don’t have a specific timeline yet for an IPO or an acquisition,” Eric Koger said. ModCloth has about 450 employees in San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles , and plans to add about 100 workers in 2013, he said. As the male CEO of a growing company full of stylishly dressed women, Koger takes comfort in knowing that he has a personal style consultant. “I would be markedly less fashionable if it weren’t for Susan,” he said.

OECD Proposes Plan for Crackdown on Companies’ Tax Avoidance,['Jesse Drucker' 'Rainer Buergin'],2013-07-19 12:17:18,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/oecd-proposes-plan-for-crackdown-on-companies-tax-avoidance.html,"The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development proposed a blueprint for cracking down on tax-dodging strategies used by companies such as Google Inc. (GOOG) , Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble called the OECD’s plan a “major step.” The proposal aims to develop rules over the next two years preventing companies from escaping taxes by putting patent rights into shell companies, taking interest deductions in one country without reporting taxable profit in another, and forcing them to disclose to regulators where they report their income around the world. “It’s a matter of justice and fairness that multinational companies pay their fair contribution” to national budgets, Schaeuble told reporters today before a meeting of Group of 20 finance chiefs and central bankers in Moscow. Without “fair burden sharing, in the end we will destroy even a global, open economy,” he said. The 40-page report will complement efforts by deficit-laden governments to increase revenue they collect from profitable enterprises. It follows hearings in the U.S. and U.K. revealing how companies avoided billions in taxes by attributing profits to mailbox subsidiaries in places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. The U.K. Parliament has held three hearings since November on corporate tax dodging -- examining strategies used by Google, Amazon and Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) In May, the U.S. Senate held a hearing on Apple’s offshore tax strategies. The companies all say they’ve complied with international tax laws. Intellectual Property “It is clear multinational companies have developed an unprecedented know-how for minimizing their worldwide tax pressure,” French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said in Moscow. “These situations are literally impossible to explain to our fellow citizens.” A pair of the OECD proposals calls for rules to make it harder to shift profits by assigning intellectual property, such as patent rights, to offshore units. Under current law, such offshore subsidiaries can take credit for profits arising from patents developed in countries like the U.S. and U.K. -- generally with cash the parent companies provided to them in the first place. Mountain View, Calfornia-based Google, for example, has avoided as much as $2 billion in worldwide income taxes annually by attributing profits to a subsidiary in Bermuda that holds the rights to its intellectual property for sales outside the U.S., as reported by Bloomberg News in December. Economic Activity Though there is no real economic activity going on in Bermuda “all the returns are in Bermuda,” said Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the Center for Tax Policy and Administration for the Paris-based OECD, not referring specifically to Google. “This is wrong, we need to fix it.” The OECD is a government-funded think tank that was charged by the G-20 to tackle the issue. The plan contrasts with the OECD’s previous approach that critics say enabled corporate-profit shifting and resisted reform efforts. As reported by Bloomberg News in March, the agency has seen a revolving door between the top tax officials that write its guidelines and law firms that advise companies on manipulating those rules to avoid taxes. “For an OECD document this is a really strong report,” said Stephen E. Shay, former deputy assistant secretary for international-tax affairs at the U.S. Treasury Department under President Barack Obama and now a professor at Harvard Law School. “It’s proposing what could be important and positive changes to international tax rules. Whether the member countries can get there, that’s an open question.” OECD Objectives Achieving the plan’s objectives may be hamstrung by the role that several European countries -- including Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg -- play in enabling the avoidance, said Sol Picciotto, an emeritus professor of law at Lancaster University in the U.K. and a senior adviser to the Tax Justice Network advocacy group. “It depends on governments willing to take measures and the OECD doesn’t have any power to compel any governments to do anything,” he said. The OECD rejected a fundamental overhaul. Under current law in most developed countries, companies allocate corporate income for tax purposes based on paper transactions between units under “arm’s-length” prices, or the amounts that would be paid between unrelated parties. That has let subsidiaries in tax havens pay low prices for patent rights, moving profits offshore. ‘Piecemeal Patches’ A competing approach, considered by the European Union since 2004, would allocate companies’ profit between countries based on measures such as sales in each country. The OECD plan said moving to this system, known as “formulary apportionment,” is not viable. The Tax Justice Network, a non-profit group that has pressured government agencies to work on these issues, called the OECD plan “a series of piecemeal patches. These patches are generally to be welcomed, as immediate remedies to the gaping holes in the broken international tax system.” The group further criticized the OECD for not opening the door to formulary apportionment, which it said would tax companies based on the “genuine economic substance of what they do and where they do it.” Instead, the agency has “for years stubbornly clung to the outdated principles of a system devised 80 years ago.” ‘Realistic Assessment’ Last month, the International Monetary Fund issued a report saying that the possibility of switching to a formulary system based on actual economic activities such as sales in a given country deserves “a more thorough and realistic assessment.” Meanwhile, a coalition of development agencies, including Oxfam and Christian Aid, criticized the plan for not adequately including developing countries that are not members of the OECD. “International tax rules affect everyone and it is often the poorest countries that suffer the greatest losses due to tax abuse,” said Oxfam’s senior policy advisor Claire Godfrey. The groups called on the OECD to adjust its proposal to require companies to tell regulators in each country where they report their profits so that such disclosures would be made public. That way “we can see exactly how much profit they are parking in tax havens.” U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said the OECD report “shows how taxpayers, governments and businesses all suffer when some companies manipulate the tax system to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. And it highlights how much we still have to do to bring the international tax system, conceived back in the 1920s, into the 21st century.” Although the U.K. has been accelerating its own efforts to help multinationals avoid taxes, Cameron said in a statement that he would highlight the OECD plan at the G-20 Summit in St. Petersburg in September. “I will call on fellow leaders to get behind this action plan to ensure that we break down the walls of corporate secrecy, once and for all, and that all companies pay their fair share.” To contact the reporters on this story: Jesse Drucker in New York at jdrucker4@bloomberg.net ; Rainer Buergin in Moscow at rbuergin1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: James Hertling at jhertling@bloomberg.net",['Jesse DruckerRainer Buergin'],"OECD Proposes Plan for Crackdown on Companies’ Tax Avoidance The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development proposed a blueprint for cracking down on tax-dodging strategies used by companies such as Google Inc. (GOOG) , Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble called the OECD’s plan a “major step.” The proposal aims to develop rules over the next two years preventing companies from escaping taxes by putting patent rights into shell companies, taking interest deductions in one country without reporting taxable profit in another, and forcing them to disclose to regulators where they report their income around the world. “It’s a matter of justice and fairness that multinational companies pay their fair contribution” to national budgets, Schaeuble told reporters today before a meeting of Group of 20 finance chiefs and central bankers in Moscow. Without “fair burden sharing, in the end we will destroy even a global, open economy,” he said. The 40-page report will complement efforts by deficit-laden governments to increase revenue they collect from profitable enterprises. It follows hearings in the U.S. and U.K. revealing how companies avoided billions in taxes by attributing profits to mailbox subsidiaries in places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. The U.K. Parliament has held three hearings since November on corporate tax dodging -- examining strategies used by Google, Amazon and Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) In May, the U.S. Senate held a hearing on Apple’s offshore tax strategies. The companies all say they’ve complied with international tax laws. Intellectual Property “It is clear multinational companies have developed an unprecedented know-how for minimizing their worldwide tax pressure,” French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said in Moscow. “These situations are literally impossible to explain to our fellow citizens.” A pair of the OECD proposals calls for rules to make it harder to shift profits by assigning intellectual property, such as patent rights, to offshore units. Under current law, such offshore subsidiaries can take credit for profits arising from patents developed in countries like the U.S. and U.K. -- generally with cash the parent companies provided to them in the first place. Mountain View, Calfornia-based Google, for example, has avoided as much as $2 billion in worldwide income taxes annually by attributing profits to a subsidiary in Bermuda that holds the rights to its intellectual property for sales outside the U.S., as reported by Bloomberg News in December.

J.K. Rowling and the Chamber of Literary Fame,['Duncan J.Watts'],2013-07-19 15:15:51,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/j-k-rowling-and-the-chamber-of-literary-fame.html,"Last weekend’s revelation that J.K. Rowling is the author of the critically acclaimed and -- until now -- commercially unsuccessful crime novel “The Cuckoo’s Calling” has electrified the book world and solidified Rowling’s reputation as a genuine writing talent: After all, if she can impress the critics without the benefit of her towering reputation, then surely her success is deserved. And yet what this episode actually reveals is the opposite: that Rowling’s spectacular career is likely more a fluke of history than a consequence of her unique genius. Whenever someone is phenomenally successful, whether it’s Rowling as an author, Bob Dylan as a musician or Steve Jobs as an innovator, we can’t help but conclude that there is something uniquely qualifying about them, something akin to “genius,” that makes their successes all but inevitable. Even when we learn about their early setbacks -- Rowling’s original manuscript for “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” was rejected by no fewer than 12 publishers; Columbia Records Inc. initially refused to release Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone”; Jobs was booted from Apple Inc. in the mid-1980s -- we interpret them as embarrassing oversights that were subsequently corrected rather than evidence that their success may have somehow been a product of luck or happenstance. The Experiment Several years ago, my colleagues Matthew Salganik and Peter Dodds at Columbia University and I challenged this conventional wisdom with an unusual experiment. We set out to prove that market success is driven less by intrinsic talent than by “cumulative advantage,” a rich-get-richer process in which early, possibly even random events are amplified by social feedback and produce large differences in future outcomes. To test our cumulative-advantage hypothesis, we recruited almost 30,000 participants to listen, rate and download songs by bands they had never heard of. Unbeknownst to the participants, they were randomly assigned to one of two groups: an “independent” group, which saw only the names of the bands and the songs, and a “social influence” group, whose participants could see how many times songs had been downloaded by others in the group. In addition, those in the social-influence group were assigned to one of eight different “worlds” that were created concurrently, allowing us to effectively “run” history many times. If quality determined success, the same songs should have won every time by a margin that was independent of what people knew about the choices of others. By contrast, if success was driven disproportionately by a few early downloads, subsequently amplified by social influence, the outcomes would be largely random and would also become more unequal as the social feedback became stronger. What we found was highly consistent with the cumulative-advantage hypothesis. First, when people could see what other people liked, the inequality of success increased, meaning that popular songs became more popular and unpopular songs become less so. Second and more surprisingly, each song’s popularity was incredibly unpredictable: One song, for example, came in first out of 48 we sampled in one “world,” but it came in 40th in another. In the real world, of course, it’s impossible to travel back in time and start over, so it’s much harder to argue that someone who is incredibly successful may owe their success to a combination of luck and cumulative advantage rather than superior talent. But by writing under the pseudonym of Robert Galbraith, an otherwise anonymous name, Rowling came pretty close to recreating our experiment, starting over again as an unknown author and publishing a book that would have to succeed or fail on its own merits, just as Harry Potter had to 16 years ago -- before anyone knew who Rowling was. False Results Rowling made a bold move and, no doubt, is feeling vindicated by the critical acclaim the book has received. But there’s a catch: Until the news leaked about the author’s real identity, this critically acclaimed book had sold somewhere between 500 and 1,500 copies, depending on which report you read. As they say in the U.K., that’s rubbish! What’s more, had the author actually been Robert Galbraith, the book would almost certainly have continued to languish in obscurity, probably forever. “The Cuckoo’s Calling” will now have a happy ending, and its success will only perpetuate the myth that talent is ultimately rewarded with success. What Rowling’s little experiment has actually demonstrated, however, is that quality and success are even more unrelated than we found in our experiment. It might be hard for a book to become a runaway bestseller if it’s unreadably bad (although one might argue that the Twilight series and “Fifty Shades of Grey” challenge this constraint), but it is also clear that being good, or even excellent, isn’t enough. As one of the hapless editors who turned down the Galbraith manuscript put it , “When the book came in, I thought it was perfectly good -- it was certainly well-written -- but it didn’t stand out.” Ironically, that’s probably how those 12 editors felt about the original “Harry Potter” manuscript. Now, of course, they look like idiots, but what both our experiment and Rowling’s suggest is that they might have been right all along. Had things turned out only slightly different, the real Rowling might have met with the same success as the fake Robert Galbraith, not the other way around. As hard as it is to imagine in the Harry Potter-obsessed world that we now inhabit, it’s entirely plausible that in this parallel universe, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” would just be a “perfectly good” book that never sold more than a handful of copies; Rowling would still be a struggling single mother in Manchester, England ; and the rest of us would be none the wiser.

Dell Gains After Goldman Says Leveraged Buyout Possible,['Niamh Ring'],2012-12-03 21:23:45,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-03/dell-gains-after-goldman-says-leveraged-buyout-possible.html,"Dell Inc.

The shares rose 4.4 percent to $10.06 at the close, the highest price since Sept. 24. The shares have declined 31 percent this year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has risen 12 percent. Dell, the No. 3 personal computer maker, is struggling as companies wait to upgrade machines and consumers turn to smartphones and tablets like Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad and iPhone. While demand for PCs has declined, Dell’s net cash balance of $5.15 billion provides “some downside buffer as it produces opportunity for an LBO or levered recap under the right conditions,” said Bill Shope, an analyst at Goldman. “Dell has become an attractive deep value play and we would be buyers of the stock,” Shope said in a research report. He raised his price target on Round Rock, Texas-based Dell to $13 from $9, and had previously recommended selling the shares. David Frink , a spokesman for Dell, declined to comment on the Goldman research. “Our focus is on long-term strategy,” Frink said.
